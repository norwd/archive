That's essentially correct.
<p>
&gt; My problem is that, looking at the precedence table, I can't seem to
<br>
&gt; understand it.
<br>
&gt; <TT>++</TT> has greater precedence than <TT>*</TT>, and both evaluate from right to left.
<br>
&gt; So, in <TT>*p++</TT> shouldn't <TT>++</TT> be evaluated first, and then dereferenced?
<p>
I think what you've managed to do here is confuse precedence with
order of evaluation.  But don't worry: it's extremely easy to
confuse precedence with order of evaluation, so easy that on the
other hand it can be very hard -- sometimes I find it essentially
impossible -- to explain why precedence is <em>not</em> the same thing
as order of evaluation.  But your example, and more importantly,
your misinterpretation of this example, provides an excellent
arena for explaining this subtle point.  So thanks for asking.
<p>
Yes, the precedence of postfix <TT>++</TT> is higher than unary <TT>*</TT>.
Now, the important thing about precedence is <em>not</em> that it tells
us what order things will be evaluated in.  The important thing
about precedence is that it tells us which operators are matched
up with which operands.
<p>
When we look at the expression <TT>*p++</TT>, before we can even start
worrying about what order things will be evaluated in, we have
to figure out what the expression is supposed to <em>mean</em>.  The <TT>*</TT>
says that we're taking the contents of a pointer, and the <TT>++</TT>
says that we're incrementing something.  But what are we
incrementing, the pointer or the value pointed to?
<p>
Precedence tells us.  <em>If</em> the precedence of unary <TT>*</TT> were
higher than postfix <TT>++</TT> (which it is not), then <TT>*p++</TT> would mean
"take the contents of the object pointed to by <TT>p</TT>, and increment
it in-place".  However, since it's actually the precedence of
postfix <TT>++</TT> that's higher, the correct interpretation is that what
we're incrementing is the pointer, and what we're taking the
contents of is the pointer as operated on by the postfix <TT>++</TT>
operator.
<p>
Notice that I did <em>not</em> say, "the interpretation is that first
we increment the pointer, and then we take the contents of
the incremented pointer".  When we use words like "first" and
"and then", we're talking about order of evaluation, but order
of evaluation can be a very slippery thing to talk about.  Here,
by talking about it too soon, we'd confuse ourselves into getting
the wrong answer, because as we'll see, although in <TT>*p++</TT> we do in
fact take "the contents of the pointer as operated on by the
postfix <TT>++</TT> operator", by the definition of postfix <TT>++</TT>, the
pointer value we'll take the contents of is the prior,
unincremented value.
<p>
So let's look at <TT>*p++</TT> very carefully.  Once more, since <TT>++</TT> has
higher precedence, we're (a) applying <TT>++</TT> to <TT>p</TT>, and (b) applying <TT>*</TT>
to the result.  In other words, the correct interpretation is as
if we had written
<p><pre><TT>
	*(p++)
</TT></pre><p>
So we're taking the contents of the subexpression <TT>p++</TT>.  Now, what
is the value of the subexpression <TT>p++</TT>?  The definition of postfix
<TT>++</TT> is that it increments a variable, but yields as its value the
prior, unincremented value.  Remember, when you say
<p><pre><TT>
	int i = 5;
	int j = i++;
</TT></pre><p>
you end up with the value 5 in <TT>j</TT>, even though <TT>i</TT> ends up as 6.
It's the same with pointer values: when you evaluate <TT>*p++</TT>, you
end up with the value that <TT>p</TT> used to point to, even though <TT>p</TT> ends
up pointing one beyond it.  Try it -- compile and run this little
program:
<p><pre><TT>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	int a[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
	int main()
	{
		int *p = &amp;a[5];
		int i = *p++;
		printf("%d %d\n", i, *p);
		return 0;
	}
</TT></pre><p>
The program prints "5 6" -- <TT>i</TT> receives 5, the value <TT>p</TT> started out
pointing to, but <TT>p</TT> ends up pointing at 6.
<p>
Now, what if you don't want the value pointed to by the old value
of <TT>p</TT>, but the new one?  That is, what if you want to increment
the pointer, and then take the value pointed to?  This is now an
order of evaluation question, and it turns out that one of the
first things to think of whenever you have an order of evaluation
question is that there's a good chance that the answer does <em>not</em>
involve precedence.
<p>
We want an expression like <TT>*p++</TT>, in which a pointer is
incremented and its pointed-to value is fetched, except that
it's the new, incremented value that's fetched.  One way, of
course, would be to do it as two separate statements: first
evaluate <TT>p&nbsp;=&nbsp;p&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</TT>, then apply <TT>*p</TT>.  But if we want to be Real C
Programmers and use the slick shortcut <TT>++</TT> operator, all we have
to do is remember that the distinction between using the old or
the new, the unincremented or the incremented value, is precisely
the distinction between the postfix and prefix forms of <TT>++</TT>.  So
to increment <TT>p</TT> and fetch the incremented value, we'd write <TT>*++p</TT>.
<p>
(Notice, by the way, that if the explanation of <TT>*p++</TT> were
"first we increment the pointer, then we take the contents
of the incremented pointer" -- which, again, it is not --
then there would be no difference between <TT>*p++</TT> and <TT>*++p</TT>.
But of course there is -- and should be -- a very significant
difference between these two, different expressions.)
<p>
While we're here, let's explain a few more things.  Suppose we
were using <TT>*p++</TT>, and we noticed that it was the old value of the
pointer that was being used by the <TT>*</TT> operator, and we wanted it
to be the new value, and we said to ourselves, "I want it to first
increment the pointer, then take the contents of the incremented
pointer", and suppose further that we thought that the way to
get the order of evaluation we wanted was to use explicit
parentheses, leading us to write <TT>*(p++)</TT>.  What happens next?
<p>
Well, it doesn't work, of course.  <TT>*(p++)</TT> acts precisely
like plain <TT>*p++</TT>, and the reason is that the real purpose of
parentheses is not to force an order of evaluation, but rather
to override the default precedence.  So when you write <TT>*(p++)</TT>,
all that the parentheses say is, "<TT>++</TT> is applied to <TT>p</TT>, and <TT>*</TT> is
applied to the result", and that's the interpretation that the
higher precedence of <TT>++</TT> implied already, which is why the
parentheses don't make any difference.  In other words, when
you've got an order of evaluation problem, not only is the
answer probably not going to involve precedence, it's probably
not going to involve parentheses, either.
<p>
What are parentheses good for, then?  Well, let's go back to the
earlier question of whether <TT>*p++</TT> increments the pointer or the
thing pointed to.  We've seen that it increments the pointer,
but what if we want to increment the thing pointed to?  That's a
precedence problem, so the appropriate answer <em>is</em>, "use explicit
parentheses", and the result is <TT>(*p)++</TT>.  This says, <TT>*</TT> is applied
to <TT>p</TT> to fetch a value, and <TT>++</TT> is applied to the fetched value.
<p>
Exercise for the reader: <TT>(*p)++</TT> increments the pointed-to value,
but (again, by the definition of postfix <TT>++</TT>) returns the old,
unincremented pointed-to value.  What if you wanted to increment
the pointed-to value and return the new, incremented, pointed-to
value?  (Do you need explicit parentheses in this case?)
<p>
If I haven't put you to sleep by now, I'll launch into one more
little digression concerning the use of time-related concepts
to explain precedence.  Ideally, to avoid confusion between
precedence and order of evaluation, we'd use time-related
language to explain only order of evaluation, not precedence.
But when your C teacher was first explaining precedence, the
explanation probably involved an expression along the lines of
<p><pre><TT>
	1 + 2 * 3
</TT></pre><p>
and the statement was probably made that "the multiplication
happens first, before the addition, because multiplication
has higher precedence than addition".  And having heard an
explanation like that, it's all too easy to come away with the
impression that precedence controls order of evaluation, and it's
also all too easy to get into trouble later when considering an
expression like <TT>*p++</TT>, where the precedence does <em>not</em> control,
doesn't even come close to controlling, the aspect of evaluation
order that you're interested in.
<p>
If we look at the expression <TT>1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;*&nbsp;3</TT> very carefully, the
key aspect explained by precedence is that the multiplication
operator is applied to the operands 2 and 3, and the addition
operator is applied to 1 and the result of the multiplication.
(Notice that I said "and", not "and then").  Here, although
there's definitely an order of evaluation issue, and although the
order of evaluation is apparently influenced by the precedence
somehow, the influence is actually not a direct one.  The real
constraint on the order of evaluation is that we obviously
can't complete an addition which involves the result of the
multiplication until we've got the result of that multiplication.
So we're probably going to have to do the multiplication first
and the addition second, but this is mostly a consequence of
causality, not precedence.
<p>
But if your C instructor misled you into thinking that precedence
had more to do with order of evaluation than it does, have pity,
because I don't know of a good way of explaining precedence that
doesn't involve time-related concepts, either.  My students used
to have to watch me do battle with myself, lips flapping like a
fish but with no words coming out, as one part of my brain,
paranoid about the possibility of later misunderstandings,
desperately tried to keep another part from blurting out the
dreaded "the multiplication happens first, before the addition,
because multiplication has higher precedence than addition".
(And at least half the time, that's probably what I ended up
saying anyway.)
<p>
<p>
&gt; So, for example, having
<br>
&gt;	<TT>char *p = "Hello";</TT>
<br>
&gt;	<TT>printf("%c", *p++);</TT>
<br>
&gt; shouldn't return <TT>'e'</TT> ?
<p>
Nope.  By the arguments above, it prints <TT>'H'</TT>.
To print <TT>'e'</TT>, you'd want <TT>*++p</TT>.
