&gt; 
<br>
&gt; Your problem is in <TT>strcpy()</TT>. It is <TT>strcpy(</TT>destination, source<TT>)</TT>;
<br>
&gt; There is no need for the <TT>=</TT> here.
<p>
True, but that was only <em>one</em> of his problems, and here,
as so often happens (to borrow a line from Douglas Adams), the
superficial design flaw has hidden a more fundamental design flaw.
<p>
&gt; Try this:
<br>
&gt; 	<TT>char *play[2]={"1","2"};</TT>
<br>
&gt; 	<TT>strcpy(play[0],"3");</TT>
<br>
&gt; 	<TT>strcpy(play[1],"4");</TT>
<p>
This is also likely to seg fault or otherwise abort.  The problem
is that the two pointers <TT>play[0]</TT> and <TT>play[1]</TT> point to constant
strings, as requested by the string literals <TT>"1"</TT> and <TT>"2"</TT>.  Those
constant stings are <em>not</em> necessarily writable, and on more and
more systems, attempts to do so will fail.  Yet modifying those
strings is exactly what the calls
<p>
<pre>
	strcpy(play[0], "3"); strcpy(play[1], "4");
</pre>
<p>
attempt to do -- the <TT>"3"</TT>, for example, is supposed to be copied
into the (possibly read-only) memory occupied by the constant
string <TT>"1"</TT>.
<p>
The situation is different if <TT>play[0]</TT> and <TT>play[1]</TT> are arrays
rather than pointers.  If the code had been
<p>
<pre>
	char playa[2][2] = {"1", "2"};
</pre>
<p>
then the <TT>strcpy</TT> calls would have been correct and guaranteed to
work.  Here, <TT>playa[0]</TT> is not a pointer to a <TT>char</TT>, it is an array
of <TT>char</TT>, and a writable one at that.  In this case, it doesn't
matter whether the string literal <TT>"1"</TT> is writable or not, because
when a string literal is used as an array initializer, the string
is copied into the array, after which it's the array you might be
trying to write to, not the string literal.
<p>
There's a second potential problem with those <TT>strcpy</TT> calls, of
course.  If the replacement strings were any longer, e.g. if we
were to call
<p>
<pre>
	strcpy(play[0], "345"); strcpy(play[1], "678");
</pre>
<p>
we would exceed the storage allocated for the two initial
strings, and this would be a problem regardless of whether we
were using pointers or arrays.  (In the array case, we could
preallocate the arrays larger than required, by declaring, say,
<TT>char playa[2][10]</TT>, where we'd be assuming that no string longer
than 9 characters would ever be copied into either of the arrays.)
<p>
<br>
<p>
There's actually a very interesting sort of paradox underlying
this whole issue.  It's true that strings in C are arrays, and
it's true that you can't assign arrays, and it's true that you
therefore often need to call <TT>strcpy</TT> when you want to "assign" a
string.  But this does <em>not</em> mean that whenever you have the
notions of "string" and "assign" in your head, you should
reflexively call <TT>strcpy</TT>!  The reason is that strings are often
referred to by pointers, and <TT>strcpy</TT> can be dangerous when used
with unknown pointers (that is, when you're not sure how much
memory they point to, or whether the memory is writable).
<p>
The paradox is that although your C teacher told you that since
arrays aren't assignable you have to call <TT>strcpy</TT> to "assign" a
string, pointers <em>are</em> assignable, and it's often much safer to
use simple assignment when working with pointers to strings!
(Besides safety, if you're at all worried about efficiency,
assigning pointers can be significantly more efficient than
copying strings around all the time.)
<p>
For example, the code
<p>
<pre>
	char *play[2] = {"1", "2"};
	strcpy(play[0], "3");
	strcpy(play[1], "4");
</pre>
<p>
is wrong, because it attempts to overwrite constant strings.
Furthermore, the code
<p>
<pre>
	char *play[2] = {"1", "2"};
	strcpy(play[0], "345");
	strcpy(play[1], "678");
</pre>
<p>
is doubly wrong, because it attempts to overwrite constant
strings and overflows them if it succeeds.  <strong>BUT</strong>, the code
<p>
<pre>
	char *play[2] = {"1", "2"};
	play[0] = "3";
	play[1] = "4";
</pre>
<p>
is perfectly legal and correct, as is
<p>
<pre>
	char *play[2] = {"1", "2"};
	play[0] = "345";
	play[1] = "678";
</pre>
<p>
In these cases, we're reassigning the pointers to point to
different string constants, and although those string constants
might not be writable, either, we've successfully accomplished
our goal of assigning new string values to <TT>play[0]</TT> and <TT>play[1]</TT>.
<p>
Here's another example.  When attempting to write a function
which returns a string, beginners frequently write code like
this:
<p>
<pre>
	char *digitvalue(int d)
	{
		char result[10];
		switch(d) {
			case 0: strcpy(result, "zero"); break;
			case 1: strcpy(result, "one");  break;
			case 2: strcpy(result, "two");  break;
		...
			case 9: strcpy(result, "nine"); break;
		}
		return result;
	}
</pre>
<p>
This code has a serious and fatal bug, of course: the local
<TT>result</TT> array will not exist by the time the function returns
to its caller, so the pointer that the caller receives will be
useless.  (See the <a href="../../../c-faq.com/index.html">comp.lang.c FAQ</a> list, question <a href="../../../c-faq.com/q7.5.html">7.5</a>.)  One
recommended fix for this problem is to declare the <TT>result</TT> array
as <TT>static</TT>, but taking the larger view, it turns out that might
not be the best fix in this situation, after all!  Much better,
I think, is to rewrite the function completely, as
<p>
<pre>
	const char *digitvalue(int d)
	{
		switch(d) {
			case 0: return "zero";
			case 1: return "one";
			case 2: return "two";
		...
			case 9: return "nine";
		}
	}
</pre>
<p>
Now we've gotten rid of the <TT>result</TT> array completely; this has the
additional benefit that besides not having to worry about its
allocation, we also don't have to worry about making it big
enough.  (In other words, the arbitrary value 10 from the previous
implementation has disappeared.)  Since the returned pointers now
point directly to string literals, the pointed-to storage must not
be written to, and I've documented this fact by declaring the
function as returning <TT>const char *</TT>.  (This may seem like an
unfortunate and perhaps unacceptable additional restriction over
the initial implementation, but since the initial implementation
returned a pointer to storage which was neither readable nor
writable, I'm perfectly comfortable with the function as
modified.)  If your programming style disallows functions with
multiple exit points, you can use a temporary internal return
value which is a pointer rather than an array:
<p>
<pre>
	const char *digitvalue(int d)
	{
		const char *result;
		switch(d) {
			case 0: result = "zero"; break;
			case 1: result = "one";  break;
			case 2: result = "two";  break;
		...
			case 9: result = "nine"; break;
		}
		return result;
	}
</pre>
<p>
Finally, as an aside, this particular switch statement is
somewhat unnecessary -- since the case values are dense and
0-based, it would suffice to pluck the digit names out of an
array:
<p>
<pre>
	const char *digitnames[] = {"zero", "one", "two", "three",
		"four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"};

	const char *digitvalue(int d)
	{
		if(d &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; d &lt;= 9)
			return digitnames[d];
		else	return "error";
	}
</pre>
<p>
(We can immediately tell that this last implementation is
superior, because I've been able to present a complete,
equally-readable example, with error-checking, in less space
than I was formerly using to present abbreviated examples.
This last example, too, could be written with one exit point
by assigning one of the digitname strings to a local temporary
return value pointer, but the point is that it's superior to one
that used <TT>strcpy</TT> to copy one of the digitname strings to a local
temporary return value array.)
<p>
<br>
<p>
To summarize the argument I've been making, <strong>IF</strong> all the strings
you're working with are constant, it's arguably safer to use
pointer assignment all of the time, and never to call <TT>strcpy</TT>.
<p>
<strong>BUT</strong>, that's a mighty big "if", of course.  If you're
constructing any strings on the fly, perhaps by calling <TT>strcat</TT>,
you have to be more careful, because neither a rule like "always
use arrays and call <TT>strcpy</TT> for simple assignments" nor "always
use pointers and use assignment for simple assignments" will
suffice.  If you're constructing strings on the fly (or reading
them in from the outside world), you have to ensure that the
storage you write them into is both writable and big enough.
If you're using arrays, this will probably mean declaring arrays
having some explicit, maximum size (i.e. the maximum size of the
strings you'll ever be able to construct or read in), and if
you're using pointers, it will probably mean calling <TT>malloc</TT> or
<TT>realloc</TT>.  (And, if you've settled on arrays, you may end up going
back to <TT>strcpy</TT> for all string "assignments".)
<p>
<br>
<p>
The bottom line is: if you have a program that manipulates a lot
of strings, what should you choose as your basic "string" type?
If you choose "array of char", then yes, you will have to call
<TT>strcpy</TT> all the time.  But if you choose "pointer to char", you
probably do <em>not</em> want to call <TT>strcpy</TT>; most of the time you will
want to use pointer assignment instead.  (And if you want to get
the best of both worlds, by using some arrays and some pointers,
you'll have to be more careful still.)
