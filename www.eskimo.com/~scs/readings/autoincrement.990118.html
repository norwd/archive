<p>
Well, no.  That wouldn't be much of a difference, would it?
<p>
&gt; What I don't understand is what the benefit of one versus the other
<br>
&gt; is inside of code.  I have used <TT>a++</TT> many times in my for-loops
<br>
&gt; [ie, <TT>for (a = 0; a &gt; 10; a++)</TT> ... etc]
<p>
Part of the trick of understanding the difference between <TT>a++</TT> and
<TT>++a</TT> is to realize that sometimes, there is no difference.  The
difference between <TT>a++</TT> and <TT>++a</TT> is in what value is "returned" to
the surrounding expression, but this obviously makes a difference
only when there <em>is</em> a surrounding expression, when the <TT>a++</TT> or
<TT>++a</TT> appears as a subexpression within a larger expression.
When the <TT>a++</TT> or <TT>++a</TT> stands alone, as it does in the loop header
<p>
<pre>
	for(a = 0; a &lt; 10; a++)
</pre>
<p>
there is no effective difference at all; that loop is 100%
equivalent to one that begins
<p>
<pre>
	for(a = 0; a &lt; 10; ++a)
</pre>
<p>
When the <TT>a++</TT> or <TT>++a</TT> does appear as a subexpression within a
larger expression, the difference is that <TT>a++</TT> "returns" the old,
unincremented value of <TT>a</TT> to the surrounding expression, while for
<TT>++a</TT> you get the new, incremented value.
<p>
&gt; I learn best by simple example, so if you have some code you can show
<br>
&gt; off the best use and explanation of the differences between these, then
<br>
&gt; by all means supply it in a reply.
<p>
Here's some code.
(The example is going to seem excessively long, but
underlying that length is the simplicity you asked for, so please
bear with me.  It's long because I'm going to try to make it
realistic; I'm going to motivate the choice between prefix and
postfix <TT>++</TT> with a convincing example, rather than an arbitrary
fragment like <TT>b = a++</TT>, and I'm going to provide a fair amount of
commentary along the way.)
<p>
Suppose we have an array of integers
<p>
<pre>
	int numbers[10];
</pre>
<p>
which we're going to fill in with numbers read from the user.
We're not sure how many numbers the user is going to type in --
sometimes it will be less than 10 -- so we'll keep a second
variable,
<p>
<pre>
	int nnumbers;
</pre>
<p>
to keep track of how many numbers the user <em>did</em> type in.
Our very first cut at writing the code to read in the numbers
might look something like this:
<p>
<pre>
	int i, x;
	for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
		{
		x = getnumberfromuser();
		if(x &lt;= 0)
			break;
		numbers[i] = x;
		}

	nnumbers = i;
</pre>
<p>
Here we've deferred the question of how exactly we're going to
accept numbers from the user by moving that functionality off
into a function, <TT>getnumberfromuser()</TT>.  (I'll provide a sample
implementation below, for completeness.)  We've hypothesized
that <TT>getnumberfromuser()</TT> will return 0 or a negative number to
indicate that the user has finished typing in numbers (perhaps
because we'll simply ask the user to type in 0 or -1 to indicate
the end of the list).  Since the <TT>numbers[]</TT> array is size 10, we
start off imagining that we'll make 10 trips through the loop to
fill in up to 10 numbers.  If the user indicates the end of the
list (that is, types 0 or -1) after typing fewer than 10 numbers,
we won't be getting 10 numbers, after all, so we take an early
exit from the loop with the <TT>break</TT> statement.
<p>
The code above will work, but it has a few deficiencies.
The most serious (though the least obvious) is that if the
<TT>getnumberfromuser()</TT> function explicitly prompts the user to enter
a number (which is quite a likely implementation), the user
experience will be significantly different depending on whether
the user types 10 numbers, or fewer than 10 numbers.  If the user
types, say, 7 numbers, another prompt will appear (which would be
for the 8th number), and the user will type 0 or -1 to indicate
completion.  If the user types 10 numbers, however, the loop
will take its normal exit (because the condition <TT>i &lt; 10</TT> in the
for loop will no longer be true), and <TT>getnumberfromuser()</TT> will
not be called at all, and no 11th prompt will appear, and the
user won't have to type (or be given the opportunity to type)
0 or -1 at all.
<p>
Other deficiencies (though they're more minor stylistic quibbles)
concern the loop used and the number of variables used.  The loop
<p>
<pre>
	for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
</pre>
<p>
suggests that we expect the loop to be traversed 10 times most of
the time, except under exceptional circumstances, but in fact if
it's normal for the user to type fewer than 10 numbers, the loop
will exit abnormally (via the <TT>break</TT> statement) most of the time.
(And if the user does frequently type all 10 numbers, it's
possible that the constant 10 in the program is too small,
that the user would like to be typing more numbers, if given
the chance.)  There's nothing wrong with using a <TT>break</TT> statement,
especially when the condition it represents is truly exceptional,
but this particular use isn't the best.
<p>
Finally, there's at least one more variable in this first code
fragment than we really need.  Within the loop, the variable <TT>i</TT>
keeps track of how many trips we've made through the loop and
hence how many numbers the user has typed so far.  But at the end
of the loop, we copy <TT>i</TT> out into our other variable, <TT>nnumbers</TT>,
which we had specified would contain the final number of numbers
the user eventually typed.  It turns out we can get by with just
<TT>i</TT> or just <TT>nnumbers</TT>; we don't need both.  (There's nothing
intrinsically wrong with using more variables than are strictly
required -- an overzealous attempt to re-use variables can lead
to buggy or difficult-to-understand programs -- but sometimes, as
here, extra variables indicate that the flow of the code is not
as clean as it could be.)
<p>
A better loop would emphasize that we're going to accept numbers
as long as the user keeps volunteering them, and would relegate
the <TT>i &lt; 10</TT> test to the exceptional condition, since that test is
more of an accident of the (rather arbitrary) choice of 10 as the
maximum number of numbers the program can support.  Writing a
loop that accepts numbers as long as the user keeps typing them
sounds much more like a <TT>while</TT> loop than a <TT>for</TT> loop, and indeed
the kind of loop we want to write, in pseudo-code, will look
something like
<p>
<pre>
	while(there's another number)
		{
		store it in numbers[];
		increment nnumbers;
		}
</pre>
<p>
One way to implement the loop "while(there's another number)"
would be
<p>
<pre>
	while(getnumberfromuser() &gt; 0)
</pre>
<p>
But that won't work for this example, because when a number came
back from the <TT>getnumberfromuser()</TT> function, we'd (properly)
compare it with zero to determine whether it was a positive
number or a zero-or-negative sentinel indicating that the user
was finished, but then we'd lose track of the just-returned value
and wouldn't be able to store it in the <TT>numbers[]</TT> array, which
was supposed to be our primary job.  What we really want to do,
of course, is save the returned value away in a variable so that
we can both test it against 0 and (if necessary) use it to fill
in one of the elements of the array.  The obvious way to do that
(which is about what we used in our first attempt) is
<p>
<pre>
	x = getnumberfromuser();
	if(x &gt; 0)
		store x in numbers[] and continue reading;
	else	we're done reading numbers;
</pre>
<p>
The slightly less-than-obvious way, but which is ideal for
while loops like the one we're trying to write, is to bury the
assignment inside the conditional:
<p>
<pre>
	(x = getnumberfromuser()) &gt; 0
</pre>
<p>
Here we store <TT>getnumberfromuser</TT>'s return value into the variable
<TT>x</TT>, and then use the "return" value of the assignment operator as
the left-hand operand of the <TT>&gt;</TT> operator.  The "return" value of
an assignment operator is simply the value assigned, so the net
result is that we both store <TT>getnumberfromuser</TT>'s return value
away in <TT>x</TT> for future reference, and also immediately compare it
against 0 to see if it's a number we want, or not.  Placed into
a <TT>while</TT> loop (but still using some pseudocode), the expression
is used like this:
<p>
<pre>
	while((x = getnumberfromuser()) &gt; 0)
		{
		store x in numbers[];
		}

	we're done reading numbers;
</pre>
<p>
If you don't mind the embedded assignment-and-test epitomized by
the expression <TT>(x = getnumberfromuser()) &gt; 0</TT>, this is a splendid
way to write the loop, and it corrects the first stylistic
deficiency.  (Actually, I hope you don't mind the embedded
assignment-and-test, because it's quite a popular idiom in C!)
Now I'll move on to the second deficiency, because even though it
was quite minor, it's going to be at the center of our decision
whether to use prefix or postfix <TT>++</TT> (which is, believe it or not,
still what I'm ultimately trying to demonstrate here).
<p>
I want to remove the extra variable involved in the first
example.  When we're done reading numbers, the variable <TT>nnumbers</TT>
is supposed to contain the number of numbers the user has
entered.  I'm going to assert that, within the loop, <TT>nnumbers</TT>
is always going to contain the number of numbers the user has
entered so far.  (The notion that "<TT>nnumbers</TT> always contains the
number of numbers the user has entered so far" is an example of
a "loop invariant", and picking clean, simple loop invariants and
sticking to them is an excellent technique when we want to write
clean, readable code.)
<p>
Let's think about the values that <TT>nnumbers</TT> should contain as the
program fragment proceeds.  Before we make any trips through the
loop, the user won't have typed any numbers, so <TT>nnumbers</TT> should
(rather obviously) start out as 0.  At the end of the first trip
through the loop (assuming the user doesn't type 0 or -1 right
away), <TT>nnumbers</TT> should contain 1.  At the end of the second
complete trip through the loop, <TT>nnumbers</TT> should contain 2, etc.
<p>
If we're going to stick with using the <TT>nnumbers</TT> variable, and
eliminate <TT>i</TT> as redundant, we're going to have to use <TT>nnumbers</TT> to
decide which element of the <TT>numbers[]</TT> array to store each new
number in.  Since arrays in C are 0-based, the first number read
will be stored in <TT>numbers[0]</TT>, the second number will be stored in
<TT>numbers[1]</TT>, etc.  So it looks like we can store each new number
into <TT>numbers[nnumbers]</TT>, as long as we're careful to increment
<TT>nnumbers</TT> <em>after</em> we use it to decide which element of the array
to store in.  Our code (which is no longer pseudocode) therefore
looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
	nnumbers = 0;
	while((x = getnumberfromuser()) &gt; 0)
		{
		numbers[nnumbers] = x;
		nnumbers = nnumbers + 1;
		}
</pre>
<p>
We've met our goals of abandoning the <TT>for</TT> loop in favor of the
(for this problem) more-natural <TT>while</TT> loop, and of consolidating
our use of the former variable <TT>i</TT> into the <TT>nnumbers</TT> variable.  Our
loop invariant is (mostly) met: at the end of each trip through
the loop, after incrementing nnumbers, <TT>nnumbers</TT> does indeed
contain the number of numbers read so far.  (We've also lost some
functionality, and introduced a bug: we're no longer checking to
make sure we store no more than 10 numbers in the array, so it
could overflow.  We'll fix this up in a minute.)
<p>
Our purpose here (I still haven't forgotten) is to demonstrate
the choice between prefix and postfix <TT>++</TT>.  If we want to replace
the "longhand" expression <TT>nnumbers = nnumbers + 1</TT> with the
shorthand <TT>++</TT> form, we could (I suppose) write the body of the
loop as
<p>
<pre>
		{
		numbers[nnumbers] = x;
		nnumbers++;
		}
</pre>
<p>
but this doesn't buy us much (nor is it an effective
demonstration of the prefix vs. postfix decision).  Here, the
expression <TT>nnumbers++</TT> stands alone, with no surrounding
expression, so it doesn't matter whether it "returns" the old or
the new value.  We could just as well have written
<p>
<pre>
		{
		numbers[nnumbers] = x;
		++nnumbers;
		}
</pre>
<p>
We can, however, collapse the two statements in the loop
together, with a result that will look like (reverting to
pseudocode again for a moment):
<p>
<pre>
	numbers[use nnumbers and also increment it] = x;
</pre>
<p>
There are two ways to look at this process of collapsing: we can
say that it's just another example of C programmers trying to
show off and be obfuscated by cramming everything possible into
one line, or we can say that it's a good way of expressing an
idiom and strengthening a loop invariant.  (The tack this article
is taking will seem to favor the latter interpretation, but I'm
not going to try to jam it down your throat; I concede that the C
programmer proclivity to cram everything into one line can be
annoying even when there are good reasons for it.)
<p>
How do we decide whether to replace the pseudoexpression "use
nnumbers and also increment it" with <TT>++nnumbers</TT> or <TT>nnumbers++</TT>?
Remember, we wanted to store the first value read into <TT>numbers[0]</TT>,
or stated another way, to use <TT>nnumbers</TT> as a subscript before
incrementing it.  Prefix <TT>++</TT> means to increment the variable and
"return" the new incremented value, while postfix <TT>++</TT> yields the
old, unincremented value.  So postfix <TT>++</TT> is exactly what we want
here; the old body of the loop collapses down to the single
expression
<p>
<pre>
		numbers[nnumbers++] = x;
</pre>
<p>
When we put everything together, we'll also take the opportunity
to restore the missing overflow check:
<p>
<pre>
	nnumbers = 0;
	while((x = getnumberfromuser()) &gt; 0)
		{
		if(nnumbers &gt;= 10)
			{
			printf("too many numbers!\n");
			break;
			}
		numbers[nnumbers++] = x;
		}
</pre>
<p>
The nice thing about this code, besides the fact that it restores
the missing overflow check, is that its loop invariant --
"<TT>nnumbers</TT> always contains the number of numbers the user has
entered so far" -- is even stronger.  When we wrote
<p>
<pre>
	numbers[nnumbers] = x;
	nnumbers = nnumbers + 1;
</pre>
<p>
there was one spot in the code, namely in the middle of the loop
between the two statements, where the invariant wasn't true,
after all.  The reason for collapsing those two lines down to a
single expression is not to show off how much we can accomplish
in a single expression, it's because the tasks of "use <TT>nnumbers</TT>
to decide which element of the array to use" and "increment
<TT>nnumbers</TT>" are (or should be) very tightly linked.
It would be a serious error to perform one task but not the
other.  By expressing the two tasks within one expression in one
statement, we reinforce the important connection between them.
(I should point out, though, that this is still only a stylistic
consideration.  There will be little if any difference in
performance between the longhand and shorthand forms of the loop,
and if we were worried about more esoteric issues such as the
truth of the loop invariant in the face of interrupts, there
would be no significant difference between them in that respect,
either.)
<p>
If you trace back through the discussion so far, you'll find that
our choice of postfix <TT>++</TT> was rather closely tied to the fact that
arrays are 0-based in C.  Let's suppose, for a moment, that for
some reason you wanted to use a 1-based array for <TT>numbers[]</TT>.  In
other words, you want the first value read to go into <TT>numbers[1]</TT>,
the second into <TT>numbers[2]</TT>, etc.  If you don't mind wasting one
element per array, it's simple enough to simulate a 1-based array
in C -- just declare the array one bigger than it has to be:
<p>
<pre>
	int numbers[11];
</pre>
<p>
Now you can use <TT>numbers[1]</TT> through <TT>numbers[10]</TT>, and just kind of
pretend that <TT>numbers[0]</TT> isn't there.
<p>
In languages that support 1-based arrays by default, it's
unfortunately rather common to see code which (to mimic our
ongoing example) initializes <TT>nnumbers</TT> to 1, since that's the
first subscript value that will be used.  In other words,
one way (though a poor way) to write the loop would be
<p>
<pre>
	nnumbers = 1;
	while((x = getnumberfromuser()) &gt; 0)
		{
		numbers[nnumbers] = x;
		nnumbers = nnumbers + 1;
		}

 	nnumbers = nnumbers - 1;	/* correct for going one too far */
</pre>
<p>
There's an obvious problem with this code: if its loop invariant
was supposed to be "<TT>nnumbers</TT> always contains the number of
numbers the user has entered so far", it's now false most of the
time; it's true only in the middle of the loop, between the two
statements.  In fact, a more accurate loop invariant for the code
as written here would be that "<TT>nnumbers</TT> always contains one more
than the number of numbers the user has entered so far", which is
obviously a much less useful statement.  A poor loop invariant
like this always has to be propped up with fudge factors here and
there, indicated by apologetic comments such as "correct for
going one too far".
<p>
But 1-based arrays don't have to lead to convoluted code.  Look
how much simpler the code becomes if we interchange the increment
and the array assignment, and change the initial value of
nnumbers back to 0:
<p>
<pre>
	nnumbers = 0;
	while((x = getnumberfromuser()) &gt; 0)
		{
		nnumbers = nnumbers + 1;
		numbers[nnumbers] = x;
		}
</pre>
<p>
Now, it's again mostly true that "<TT>nnumbers</TT> always contains the
number of numbers the user has entered so far", but since we
increment <TT>nnumbers</TT> before using it, the first number read goes
into <TT>numbers[1]</TT>.
<p>
You can probably see where this is going.  Replacing the longhand
form <TT>numbers = numbers + 1</TT> with the autoincrement operator <TT>++</TT>,
and restoring the overflow test, we end up with this 1-based
version:
<p>
<pre>
	nnumbers = 0;
	while((x = getnumberfromuser()) &gt; 0)
		{
		if(nnumbers &gt;= 10)
			{
			printf("too many numbers!\n");
			break;
			}
		numbers[++nnumbers] = x;
		}
</pre>
<p>
If you compare this code to the previous 0-based version, you'll
see that the only difference is that it uses prefix <TT>++</TT> instead of
postfix.
<p>
<center>
*	*	*
</center>
<p>
To summarize, then: the difference between prefix and postfix <TT>++</TT>
is that prefix "returns" to the surrounding expression the new,
incremented value of the variable, while postfix yields the old,
unincremented value.  This distinction makes no difference if the
prefix or postfix expression stands alone as a full expression;
it only makes a difference when the prefix or postfix expression
sits as a subexpression within a larger expression which cares
about the value "returned."  It may seem alarming that it's taken
me 457 lines to describe this distinction, and it's true that for
most of the issues I've elaborated on here so agonizingly,
experienced C programmers make their decisions without thinking
about each tiny detail so acutely.  But if you're trying to
decide whether to use prefix or postfix autoincrement in some
code, code which you've gotten as far as the pseudocode
<p>
<pre>
	numbers[use nnumbers and also increment it] = x;
</pre>
<p>
in defining, you do need to think about the fact that arrays are
0-based in C, and about your loop invariant, before making your
decision.  When you do, you'll find that the prefix and postfix
forms are not interchangeable,
that the distinction between them is
significant and real, and that (for any given situation in which
the value is significant) one of them does just what you want
while the other would be quite wrong.
