I always have a hard time with questions like these.  Sometimes,
they hardly make sense: after all, the language is what it is,
and we simply have to...
<p><pre>
&gt; Sure, I know the answer: "this is C standard" or "this is how
&gt; language is defined", but I'm not looking for such an answer.
</pre>
<p>
Oh.  Then I guess I'm not allowed to use that answer, then.
<p><pre>
&gt; What I am looking for is the answer of the following question:
&gt; "Why the language was defined such a way".

<p>
The usual answer is that it's to avoid unnecessarily
constraining the compiler's ability to...
<p><pre>
&gt; If your answer is a form of: "This way compilers could do the better
&gt; job of optimising expressions", then remember, that compiler must

</pre>
<p>
Oh.  So I guess I'm not allowed to use that answer, either.
(Now it seems as if you're really constraining <em>me</em>!)
So I'm afraid the only truly factual answer I'm left with is
"I don't know."
<p>
I posted a long article a year or two ago exploring some reasons
why C might leave certain aspects of evaluation order undefined.
I'd re-post it now, but it would take me too long to find it in
my magtape archives, and anyway the oxide is starting to flake
off (I'm not sure if it's the fault of the drive or the tapes),
and I'm thinking that the next time I spin those tapes should
really be to transfer them to some new media, which I haven't
selected yet.
[I did eventually recover <a href="undef.950321.html">a copy</a>.]
<p>
Instead, I'll explore a couple of different reasons.  Bear in
mind that these are only my own speculations, so they absolutely
will not answer your question.  If you simply must know why C
<em>is</em> defined the way it is on this point, you'll have to ask
Dennis Ritchie.  The speculations I'll give you are some of the
ones which might now lead me to design a language the same way,
but I freely admit that my thinking on language design has been
<em>very</em> heavily influenced by C, which I somehow find pretty
congenial and easy to get along with.
<p>
A language specification is a huge set of tradeoffs.  No, don't
worry, I won't talk about the forbidden tradeoff between the
programmer's freedom of expression and the compiler's license to
optimize.  The tradeoff I'm invoking now is one of documentation:
how much time and how many words can we afford to spend defining
the language?  As in so many other areas, the law of diminishing
returns sets in here, too.  We have to ask ourselves whether an
attempt to nail down some aspect of the language more tightly is
worth it in terms of the number of programs (or programmers)
that absolutely need the extra precision.
<p>
A language specification (like any detailed specification of a
complex system) is also staggeringly difficult to write.  The
harder you try, the more questions you end up inviting from
devious folk who take your previous round of ever-more-detailed
specifications as a grand puzzle, the challenge being to find
some loophole or ambiguous case or fascinating question which
remains unanswerable in the system as constructed.
<p>
Therefore, the standard makes certain simplifications.  It makes
these not just to make compilers easier to write, not just to
make the standard easier to write, but to make it easier for the
rest of us to <em>read</em>, to wrap our brains around it and understand
it.  The more exceptions it contains, or overly complex
explanations of overly complex devices inserted just to placate
the nitpickers and puzzlemongers, the more likely it is to be
unreadable by mere mortals, or unimplementable by mere mortals,
and so ultimately to fail.
<p>
A largely forgotten aspect of the "Unix philosophy," and an
aspect which like many others is equally responsible for the
design of C as for Unix, and an aspect which is responsible both for
the success of the operating system and the language <em>and</em> for
the heaping truckloads of acrimonious criticism which both
incessantly receive, is that neither system was ever intended to
satisfy everybody.  The designers were shooting for about a 90%
solution, and were unapologetically willing to call that "good
enough."  They knew, if they tried to satisfy everybody, that the
first 90% of the requirements would take 90% of their time, and
that 9% of the remaining requirements would take the other 90% of
their time, and that 0.9% of the remaining requirements would
take <em>another</em> 90% of their time, and so on <a href="precvsooe.960728.html#footnote1">[footnote 1]</a>.
Discretion being the better part of valor, they decided -- with
remarkable restraint, which I for one could never manage -- to
nip that infinite regression in the bud.  And in one of X3J11's
admirable successes at preserving the "spirit of C," that
minimalist attitude largely pervades the C standard, as well.
<p>
Returning to the subject of expression evaluation, the
simplification of interest to us here is, in a nutshell, that how
you specify the order that things happen in is with <em>statements</em>,
and how you compute values where the order doesn't matter much
is with <em>expressions</em>.  If you care about the order, you need
separate statements.  (There were always a few exceptions to this
simplistic rule, of course; ANSI added a few more).  The modern,
more precise statement is that if you need to be sure that side
effects have taken effect, you need to have a sequence point, but
to keep everybody's life simple, there are still relatively few
defined sequence points.  If you have a complex expression with
complicated sequencing requirements, you may simply have to break
it up into several statements, and maybe use a temporary
variable.  That was true in K&amp;R (I've already quoted the relevant
sentences from section 2.12), and it's true today.  It's a simple
rule to state, it's a simple rule to implement, and at least 90%
of expressions (and in fact far more, probably closer to 99.9%)
can in fact be written as single, simple expressions, because
they <em>are</em> simple and <em>don't</em> have complicated sequencing
requirements.
<p>
I honestly believe that the existing rules are good enough, and
that the excruciating discussions which we have about the issue
here from time to time tend to overstate its importance.
I probably break an expression up into two statements to keep
its sequence correct about twice a year <a href="precvsooe.960728.html#footnote2">[footnote 2]</a>.  The vast
majority of the time, you don't have to worry about the order
of multiple side effects (most of the time, because there aren't
multiple side effects), and when you do, I claim (though I
realize how patronizing this sounds to the people I most wish
would think about it) that the expression is probably too
complicated and that it should probably be simplified if for
no other reason than so that people could understand it, and
incidentally so that it would be well-defined to the compiler.
<p>
In closing, let me offer another way of thinking about order of
evaluation, which I came up with a day or two ago and refined
during a brief e-mail exchange with James Robinson.  As I
mentioned, compilers tend to build parse trees, and precedence
has some influence on the shape of parse trees which has some
influence on the order of evaluation.  What's a good way of
thinking about the ways in which the shape of a parse tree does
and doesn't necessarily affect order of evaluation?
<p>
If it weren't for side effects -- assignment operators, <CODE>++</CODE>, <CODE>--</CODE>,
function calls, and (for those of you writing device drivers)
fetches from volatile locations -- <a href="precvsooe.960728.html#footnote3">[footnote 3]</a>, the entire
meaning of a parse tree would be the computation of a single
value.  Each node computes a new value from the values of its
children, so values percolate up the tree.  We have to begin
evaluation at the bottom, of course, and we can therefore say
that there's some ordering of the evaluation from bottom to top,
but we don't care about the relative ordering of parallel
branches of the tree; in fact for all we care they could be
evaluated in parallel.  The reason we don't care is precisely
that (for the moment) we are thinking about pure expression
evaluation, without side effects.
<p>
If, as I claim here, the primary purpose of a parse tree is to
generate the single value that pops out of the top of it, then a
good way to think about an expression (which is the basis for a
parse tree) is that its primary purpose is to generate a single
value, too.  We should think about side effects as in some sense
secondary, because it turns out that the Standard (and, hence,
the compiler) accords them a good deal less respect, at least
with respect to their scheduling.  We should imagine that the
compiler goes about the business of evaluating an expression by
working its way through the parse tree, applying no more ordering
constraints than the blatantly obvious one that you can't (in
general) evaluate a node until you've evaluated its children.
We should imagine that, whenever the compiler encounters a node
within the tree mandating a side effect, which would require it
to store some value in some location, it makes a little note to
itself: "I must remember to write that value to that location,
sometime", and then goes back to its true love, which is
evaluating away on that parse tree.  Finally, we should imagine
that when the compiler reaches a point which the Standard labels
as a sequence point, the compiler says to itself: "Oh, well, I
guess I can't play all day, now I'll have to get down to business
and attack that `to do' list."
<p>
Of course, I'm not saying that you <em>have</em> to think about the
situation in this way.  But if you're looking for a model which
will let you think about expression evaluation in a way that
matches the Standard's, I think this is a pretty good one.
Even though we only evaluate expressions for their side effects
(that is, the statement
<pre>
	i + 1;
</pre>
does nothing), the right way to think about expression evaluation
is that we are, after all, <em>evaluating</em> an <em>expression</em>, or
figuring out what its value is.  Its <em>one</em> value, singular.
The only ordering dependencies are those which must apply in
order to ensure that we compute the correct value.  If there are
any intermediate values that we care about, because we expect
them to be stashed away via side effects, we must not care what
order they occur in.  Therefore, if there are multiple side
effects, all of them had better write to different locations.
Also (again because we can't be sure when they'll happen) none of
them had better write to locations which we might later try to
read from within the same expression.
<p>
<p>
This may have seemed like a roundabout set of explanations, and
I'm sure it's still unsatisfying to those who insist on knowing
<em>why</em> C is as it is.  To summarize the arguments I've tried to
present here, C specifies expression evaluation as it does
because it's simple and good enough for most purposes while still
allowing (taboo answer alert!) for decently optimized code
generation, and it does not provide more guarantees about
expression evaluation because few expressions would need them.
