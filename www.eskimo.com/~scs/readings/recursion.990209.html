Here is one way to think about recursion.
<p>
Think about where you live, and think about the last time
it was really messy, and you asked your roommate or spouse
or significant other to help clean up.  If you're unlucky,
they picked up one totally obvious but well-constrained and
easy-to-pick-up piece of trash, and then decided that they'd
done enough, and curled up on the couch with a beer to watch
a football game while you did all the rest of the hard work.
(Or, if your roommate/spouse/significant other is the unlucky
one, perhaps you pulled this stunt on them.  It doesn't matter
what the roles were, the point is that there was a totally
unfair division of labor.)
<p>
Shifting from housecleaning to computer programming, let's
imagine it's our job to take a number (in binary, say) and print
out the digits of its base-ten representation in conventional
left-to-right order.  If you've never attacked it before, this
is an at least slightly tricky problem.  You can divide by 10 to
get individual digits, but of course dividing by 10 gives you the
rightmost digit first, so if you're not careful, you end up with
the digits in the wrong order.
<p>
But let's stick with this approach a bit longer, and see if we
can get anywhere.  We can start with the original number, take
the remainder when dividing it by 10, and print that digit.
Then all we have to do it figure out how to print the remaining
digits, first.  In pseudocode, we have something like
<p>
<pre>
	printdigits(int n)
	{
		int d;
		print all but the last digit of n;
		d = n % 10;
		print digit d;
	}
</pre>
<p>
Printing one digit is easy -- the digit characters <TT>'0'</TT> to <TT>'9'</TT>
are certain to have consecutive values in any sane character set
(and the ANSI/ISO C Standard mandates the choice of a character
set that is sane in this regard), so converting an integer <TT>d</TT>
which is known to be in the range 0 to 9 simply requires adding
that integer as an offset to the character constant <TT>'0'</TT>.
Applying that technique, and deferring the other vaguely-defined
part of the problem to a subfunction, we have a function which
is no longer pseudocode, but C:
<p>
<pre><TT>
	printdigits(int n)
	{
		int d;
		print_all_but_the_last_digit_of(n);
		d = n % 10;
		putchar('0' + d);
	}
</TT></pre>
<p>
Notice how much like the lazy roommate this code is.  It does the
falling-off-a-log easy part, and lets somebody else (namely, the
hypothetical function <TT>print_all_but_the_last_digit_of</TT>) do all the
hard work.  Moreover, it successfully pulls off an additional bit
of brazen audacity which not even the laziest roommate could get
away with: it lets the somebody else do the hard part <em>first</em>,
then waltzes back from the couch and does the easy bit last, just
before the final curtain falls and the applause begins.  What cheek!
<p>
Actually, we've got one piece of cheekiness left.  We've still
got to figure out how to print all but the last digit of <TT>n</TT>, and
of course we've got to print it as a string of left-to-right digits.
So it looks as if we haven't gotten <em>anywhere</em> -- (no surprise,
right, with a roommate this lazy and unhelpful!) -- the
<TT>print_all_but_the_last_digit_of()</TT> function is going to be exactly
as hard to write as <TT>printdigits()</TT> was; the "work" that's been
done (or that will have been done) so far hasn't helped us out at
all.
<p>
But wait -- printing out all but the last digit of <TT>n</TT>, in
left-to-right-order, is exactly the same problem as printing out
the digits of the quantity <TT>n/10</TT> in left-to-right order, where we
use integer arithmetic to compute <TT>n/10</TT> and throw away the
remainder.  So we now have a glimmering idea of a staggeringly
audacious move which will
make our earlier sloth seem virtuous by comparison:
what if
we <em>call</em> <em>ourselves</em> to do the hard part, then finish up and be
done with it?  That is, what if we write
<p>
<pre><TT>
	printdigits(int n)
	{
		int d;
		printdigits(n/10);
		d = n % 10;
		putchar('0' + d);
	}
</TT></pre>
<p>
where we've replaced the call to the unwritten function
<TT>print_all_but_the_last_digit_of()</TT> with a call to the function
<TT>printdigits()</TT>, which is the function we were supposed to write
in the first place??  (A function which in fact we've already
"written", except that our attempt so far seemed laughingly
incomplete and not at all functional...)  We can't possibly get
away with this, can we?  This is like trying to become rich by
borrowing a dollar from yourself one million times so that you
have $1,000,000, or inventing a time machine by inventing a time
machine and then going back in time and giving it to yourself,
or attempting to fly by pulling yourself up by your own
bootstraps, or trying to clean your room by asking your little
brother to do it, except that you're an only child, and the
"little brother" you're asking is just your reflection in a
mirror you're holding behind you, in which the ephemeral little
brother you're asking to do the work is simultaneously asking an
even-more-ephemeral little brother standing behind him, who is
asking the reflection behind him, ad infinitum...
<p>
Remarkably enough, we <em>can</em> do this, as long as we back off from
our stance of utter sloth by one little notch.  In the case when
the number we're printing has only one digit, we don't need to
delegate any of the work.  (Perhaps this decision only cements
our reputation as a glory-hogging layabout: for one-digit
numbers, we take all the credit.)  At any rate, the final
implementation looks like this:
<p>
<pre><TT>
	printdigits(int n)
	{
		int d;
		if(n &gt; 9)
			printdigits(n/10);
		d = n % 10;
		putchar('0' + d);
	}
</TT></pre>
<p>
The additional test breaks the infinite recursion; the function
won't call itself forever.  It will call itself as many times
as there are digits in the number, and the deepest recursive
call will print the leftmost digit first, and on the way back,
each successive invocation will append another to the right.
If you're having any trouble seeing this, try rewriting the
function as
<p>
<pre><TT>
	printdigits(int n)
	{
		int d;
		printf("printdigits(%d)\n", n);
		if(n &gt; 9)
			printdigits(n/10);
		d = n % 10;
		printf("printing digit %c\n", '0' + d);
	}
</TT></pre>
<p>
When called with a number such as 12345, you'll first see a flurry
of recursive calls, as each invocation madly tries to pawn the
job off on somebody else, until finally there's only one digit
left, and the innermost recursive call condescends to do some
actual work, and the logjam is broken, and the containing calls
chip in their pieces in succession, and the job is done, in a
symphony of concerted laziness.

<p>
An even cleaner demonstration of the power of recursion concerns
the traversal of binary trees.  A binary tree is a linked data
structure in which each node has up to two subtrees, with all the
items in a node's left subtree being (by definition) less than
the item contained in the node, and all the items in the right
subtree being greater.  For example, here is a binary tree
containing the letters A though K:
<p>
<pre><TT>
	      F
	     / \
	    /   \
	   /     \
	  B       H
	 / \     / \
	A   D   G   J
	   / \     / \
	  C   E   I   K
</TT></pre>
<p>
This is not the only binary tree containing the letters A through
K; there's quite a number of different ways of arranging it.
But note that, for any letter, all the letters in the subtree
below and to the left of it come before it in the alphabet, and
all the letters in the right subtree come after.  (The top item
in a node's left subtree is not necessarily immediately less than
the item at that node or anything; the immediately-preceding item
is merely down in the left subtree somewhere, along with all the
rest of the preceding items.  In the tree I've just shown, for
example, the letter F appears at the top of the tree although
it's obviously neither the first nor the last letter in the list.
The letter B which is at the top of F's left subtree does not
immediately precede F; the letter immediately preceding F is E,
which is indeed down in F's left subtree somewhere.)
<p>
We could represent one node in such a tree with an instance of
the structure
<p>
<pre><TT>
	struct tnode
		{
		char letter;
		struct tnode *left;
		struct tnode *right;
		};
</TT></pre>
<p>
To be clear: that's one structure describing one node; for a tree
with many nodes we'd have many instances of the structure.
(We'd probably allocate them dynamically using <TT>malloc</TT>.)
<p>
This structure may look dangerous -- if we're trying to describe
a <TT>struct tnode</TT>, what are those little <TT>struct tnode</TT>s doing inside
it?  They're pointers to the node's left and right subtrees,
and the reason they're okay is precisely that they are merely
pointers; they are not complete <TT>struct tnode</TT>s.  (If every
<TT>struct tnode</TT> tried to contain one or more complete struct tnodes,
the structure would obviously need to be infinitely big.)
It's perfectly acceptable (and quite common) for a structure to
contain pointers to other instances of itself; this is precisely
how lists, trees, and all sorts of other linked data structures
are commonly implemented in C.
<p>
Suppose it's our job to print one of these binary trees.
We've just been handed a pointer to the base (root) of the tree.
What do we do?  The only node we've got easy access to is the
root node, but as we saw, it's not a very interesting node
(i.e. not the first or the last element or anything); it's
generally a random node somewhere in the middle of the eventual
sorted list (distinguished only by the fact that it happened to be
inserted first).  The node that needs to be printed first is buried
somewhere down in the left subtree, and the node to print just
before the node we've got easy access to is buried somewhere else
down in the left subtree, and the node to print next (after the
one we've got) is buried somewhere down in the right subtree.
In fact, everything down in the left subtree is to be printed
before the node we've got, and everything down in the right
subtree is to be printed after.  A pseudocode description of
our task, therefore, might be
<p>
<pre><I>
	print the left subtree (in order)
	print the node we're at
	print the right subtree (in order)
</I></pre>
<p>
How can we print the left subtree, in order?  The left subtree
is, in general, another tree, so printing it out sounds about as
hard as printing an entire tree, which is what we were supposed
to do in the first place.  In fact, it's exactly as hard: it's
the same problem.  Are we going in circles?  Are we getting
anywhere?  Yes, we are: the left subtree, even though it is still
a tree, is at least <em>smaller</em> than the full tree we started with.
The same is true of the right subtree.  Therefore, we can use
a recursive call to do the hard work of printing the subtrees,
and all we have to do is the easy part: print the node we're at.
The function might look like this:
<p>
<pre><TT>
	void treeprint(struct tnode *p)
	{
		if(p-&gt;left != NULL)
			treeprint(p-&gt;left);
		printf("%c\n", p-&gt;letter);
		if(p-&gt;right != NULL)
			treeprint(p-&gt;right);
	}
</TT></pre>
<p>
In any recursive function, it is (obviously) important to
terminate the recursion, that is, to make sure that the function
doesn't recursively call itself forever.  In the case of binary
trees, the fact that the left and right subtrees are smaller
(than the tree containing them, that is) gives us the leverage we
need to make a recursive algorithm work.  When we reach a "leaf"
of the tree (more precisely, when the left or right subtree is a
null pointer), there's nothing more to visit, so the recursion
can stop.  It turns out that we can test for this in two
different ways, either before or after we make the "last"
recursive call.  In the code just above, we tested before
the call.  Here's the other way to do it:
<p>
<pre><TT>
	void treeprint(struct tnode *p)
	{
		if(p == NULL)
			return;

		treeprint(p-&gt;left);
		printf("%c\n", p-&gt;letter);
		treeprint(p-&gt;right);
	}
</TT></pre>
<p>
Sometimes, there's little difference between one approach and
the other.  Here, though, the second approach has a distinct
advantage: it will work even if the very first call is on an
empty tree.  It's extremely nice if programs work well at their
boundary conditions, even if we don't think those conditions are
likely to occur.
<p>
Another impressive thing about a recursive <TT>treeprint</TT> function is
that it's not just <em>a</em> way of writing it, or a nifty way of writing
it; it's really the <em>only</em> way of writing it.  You might try to
figure out how to write a nonrecursive version.  Once you've
printed something down in the left subtree, how do you know where
to go back up to?  Our <TT>struct tnode</TT> only has pointers down the
tree; there aren't any pointers back to the "parent" of each
node.  If you write a nonrecursive version, you have to keep
track of how you got to where you are, and it's not enough to
keep track of the parent of the node you're at; you have to keep
a stack of <em>all</em> the nodes you've passed down through.  (Even if we
did have back pointers, it's not clear that they'd give us enough
extra information to work our way though the tree in the correct
order.)  When you write a recursive version, on the other hand,
the normal function-call stack essentially keeps track of all
this for you.

Here are two more examples, one for computing the greatest common
denominator by Euclid's method, and one for computing Fibonacci
numbers:
<p>
<pre><TT>
	int gcd(int a, int b)
	{
		if(b == 0)
			return a;
		else	return gcd(b, a % b);
	}
</TT></pre>
<p>
<pre><TT>
	int fib(int n)
	{
		static int fibs[24] = {0, 1};

		if(n &lt; 0 || n &gt;= 24)
			return -1;

		if(fibs[n] == 0 &amp;&amp; n &gt; 0)
			fibs[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);

		return fibs[n];
	}
</TT></pre>
<p>
[Both of these examples are lifted from Volume II, Chapter 3
of Macmillan's <cite>Handbook of Programming Languages</cite>.]
<p>
The <TT>fib()</TT> implementation uses "memoization", involving static
data, to avoid the exponential recursive explosion which
otherwise dooms Fibonacci numbers to being the classic example
of when <em>not</em> to use recursion.
