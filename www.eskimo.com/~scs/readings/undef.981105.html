<p>
The answer, of course, is that there is no answer.
<p>
Attempting to use precedence rules to analyze malformed
expressions like these is a popular pastime, but it turns out
not to help.  It's true that the "outputs" of the two ++'s are
to be multiplied together, but what are those outputs?
<p>
Consider a related expression:
<p>
<pre>
	i = f1() * f2();
</pre>
<p>
Function calls have higher precedence than multiplication, so
the two functions will be called before the multiplication can
happen.  But which function is called first, <code>f1</code> or <code>f2</code>?  No one
can say, and different compilers do it differently.
<p>
(I suppose you might try to invoke the left-to-right associativity
of multiplication to claim that f1 would be called first, but
associativity doesn't help here, either.  Associativity says that
in <code>f1() * f2() * f3()</code>, the results of <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code> are multiplied
together before being multiplied by the result of <code>f3</code>, but we
still don't know which order the functions were called in.
<code>f3</code> might be called first, and its result saved for last.)
<p>
The situation with <code>++j * ++j</code> is actually even worse than with
<code>f1() * f2()</code>.  In the function call case, it's probably true that
either <code>f1</code> is called first and then <code>f2</code>, or <code>f2</code> is called first
and then <code>f1</code>.  Applying the same logic to <code>++j * ++j</code>, we might
imagine that either the left-hand <code>++j</code> gets evaluated first and
then the right-hand one, yielding 4 <code>*</code> 5 = 20, or else the
right-hand one gets evaluated first and then the left-hand one,
yielding 5 <code>*</code> 4 = 20.  But it turns out that this analysis doesn't
work, either.
<p>
The problem is that +<code>+j </code>does two things.  It delivers the value
<code>j+1</code> to the surrounding expression, and it stores the value <code>j+1</code>
back into <code>j</code>, thus incrementing it.  But we don't know (because
the C Standard doesn't tell us) precisely when the updated value
of <code>j</code> gets written back to j<code></code>.
<p>
In some expressions, it doesn't matter.  If we wrote
<p>
<pre>
	i = ++j * k;
</pre>
<p>
the compiler could emit code which essentially either
interpreted the expression as
<p>
<pre>
	j = j + 1;
	i = j * k;
</pre>
or
<pre>
	i = (j+1) * k;
	j = j + 1;
</pre>
<p>
If we wrote
<p>
<pre>
	i = ++j * ++k;
</pre>
<p>
there would be at least six possible interpretations:
<p>
<pre>
	j = j + 1;                    k = k + 1;
	k = k + 1;                    j = j + 1;
	i = j * k;                    i = j * k;
<p>
	i = (j+1) * (k+1);            i = (j+1) * (k+1);
	j = j + 1;                    k = k + 1;
	k = k + 1;                    j = j + 1;
<p>
	j = j + 1;                    k = k + 1;
	i = j * (k+1);                i = (j+1) * k;
	k = k + 1;                    j = j + 1;
</pre>
<p>
Now, all six of those interpretations yield the same answer
(16, if <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> both start out as 3).  But if you replace <code>k</code> in
each of them by <code>j</code>, resulting in six possible interpretations of
the expression <code>++j * ++j</code>, you can get at least three different
answers (16, 20, and 25, by my reckoning).
<p>
But it gets worse.  The official wording in the ANSI/ISO C
Standard says that if you attempt to modify the same object at
one spot within an expression and refer to that same object at
another spot (as in the expression <code>++j * j</code>), or if you attempt
to modify the same object twice within an expression (as in
the expression <code>++j * ++j</code>), the results are undefined [footnote 1].
What this means is that the compiler isn't even required to
choose among the two (or six, or however many you can come up
with) "plausible" interpretations of the expression; it can do
any random thing it wants to, and it won't be in violation of the
Standard.  (In practice, it's not so much that compilers do "any
random thing they want to" in these situations, but what does
happen is that they do any random thing that falls out of their
algorithms for handling well-formed expressions, algorithms which
are not designed -- because they do not have to be -- to do
anything reasonable with undefined expressions.)
<p>
Now, you might say (and I'd agree with you) that the expression
<code>i = ++j * ++j</code> would be so unlikely to come up in a real program
that it hardly matters what it does.  But if you think you can
analyze that expression and figure out what it does, then there's
a flaw either in your analysis or in your understanding of C.
And I would urge you to repair that flaw -- to teach yourself
that you <em>cannot</em> analyze the behavior of expressions like these
-- because that way you won't falsely imagine that you can
predict the behavior of other, more insidious undefined
expressions which <em>do</em> occasionally crop up in real programs,
expressions which will cause real problems if they are retained,
expressions which it will do nobody any positive good to be able
to analyze or justify, expressions which should ideally be
recognized as the undefined expressions they are and banished
from the program as soon as possible.
<p>
As an example of how a "more insidious undefined expression" can
in fact crop up in a real program, consider the following
decidedly non-hypothetical scenario.  (The reason I know it's
not hypothetical is that I know the programmer it happened to.)
The program is the interpreter for a stack machine, and it
contains code like
<p>
<pre>
	switch(op)
		{
		case ADD:
			push(pop() + pop());
			break;
		case SUBTRACT:
			tmp = pop();
			push(pop() - tmp);
			break;
		case MULTIPLY:
			push(pop() * pop());
			break;
		case SUBTRACT:
			tmp = pop();
			if(tmp == 0) {error("divide by 0"); break; }
			push(pop() / tmp);
			break;
		...
</pre>
<p>
In the original implementation, <code>push()</code> and <code>pop()</code> are function
calls.  The original programmer, knowing that the order of
function calls within an expression is unpredictable (see our
discussion of <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code> above) has taken care to use a temporary
variable to ensure that the operands are popped in the right
order for subtraction and division, where it matters.
<p>
But the interpreter is too slow, and a later programmer reasons
that part of the problem is function call overhead.  (Most of the
time, it's a good idea not to worry about function call overhead
too much, but in some situations, such as the inner loop of an
interpreter which might be interpreting huge amounts of code, it
can indeed be significant.)
<p>
I don't remember if the push and pop functions were
<p>
<pre>
	void push(val)
	{
	stack[stackp++] = val;
	}
<p>
	pop()
	{
	return stack[--stackp];
	}
</pre>
<p>
or
<p>
<pre>
	void push(val)
	{
	*stackp++ = val;
	}
<p>
	pop()
	{
	return *--stackp;
	}
</pre>
<p>
(That is, although the stack and the stack pointer were both
global, I don't remember whether the stack pointer was an index
or a pointer into the stack.)  But, in either case, it's easy to
see how we might replace the push and pop functions with macros,
thus removing the function call overhead in the critical inner
loop, without rewriting the entire interpreter.  (In fact, this
interpreter had hundreds of operators, some much more complicated
than simple arithmetic, so there were hundreds of calls to <code>push()</code>
and <code>pop()</code> spread across many source files.)
<p>
The macros would, of course, either be
<p>
<pre>
	#define push(val) (stack[stackp++] = (val))
	#define pop() stack[--stackp]
</pre>
<p>
or
<p>
<pre>
	#define push(val) (*stackp++ = (val))
	#define pop() *--stackp
</pre>
<p>
and this seems like a very simple way to dramatically increase
the efficiency of the interpreter.  (It did, too, by 20 or 30
percent.)  The problem was that the interpreter also began
delivering wildly erroneous answers.
<p>
The problem turned out to be in those innocuous-looking lines
<p>
<pre>
	push(pop() + pop());
</pre>
and
<pre>
	push(pop() * pop());
</pre>
<p>
for addition and multiplication.  When push() and pop() are
macros, these lines expand to either
<p>
<pre>
	(stack[stackp++] = (stack[--stackp] + stack[--stackp]));
	(stack[stackp++] = (stack[--stackp] * stack[--stackp]));
</pre>
or
<p>
<pre>
	(*stackp++ = (*--stackp + *--stackp));
	(*stackp++ = (*--stackp * *--stackp));
</pre>
<p>
And these expressions bear an eerie similarity to the one that
began this thread.  (They're complicated by an added level of
indirection, and they each attempt to modify stackp <em>three</em> times
within one expression.)  And yes, under a popular, real-world
compiler, namely gcc, these expressions did produce some crazy
result which was not at all the expected one but which, by a
strict and proper interpretation of the C Standard, was <em>not</em>
incorrect.  (That is, it was not incorrect for the compiler and
the emitted code to have produced the undesired result.)  The
compiler had not done anything wrong; the error was on the part
of the programmer who attempted to replace the function calls
with macros, macros which proved to be dangerous because of
their embedded side effects.
<p>
And finally, in case anyone is doubting the truth of this story,
I can tell you that the maintenance programmer who introduced the
undefined behavior was (as others of you have probably already
guessed) none other than the maintainer of the comp.lang.c FAQ
list, Steve Summit, who presumably ought to have known better.

Footnote 1: The real rule on undefined expressions is that you
can't modify an object twice, or modify and then inspect it,
between sequence points.  There are a few operators -- including
function calls -- which do introduce sequence points, so it's
possible to come up with expressions which contain multiple side
effects but which are not undefined.
