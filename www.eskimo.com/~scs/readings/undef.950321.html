&gt;
&gt; I may regret this, but I'll jump in anyway.  I accept that the behaviour
&gt; of such a construct is undefined simply because the Standard says so.  But
&gt; isn't it legitimate for me to ask why the Standard leaves it undefined?
</pre>
<p>
It is, but you should probably be careful how you ask it.
If you're not careful (you were careful, but most people aren't),
it ends up sounding like you don't believe that something is
undefined, or that you believe -- and your compiler happens
to agree -- that it has a sensible meaning.  But as long as
we're very clear in our heads that we're asking the abstract,
intellectual question "Why are these things undefined?", and not
anything at all practical like "How will these things behave in
practice?", we may proceed.
<p>
The first few answers I give won't be the ones you're looking
for, but towards the end I may present one which you'll find more
satisfying.
<p>
First of all, you might want to take a look at who's saying what.
I'll grant that statements such as Fred's above can be annoying.
I agree completely that it's usually very good to know the
reasons behind things.  But if the people who have been posting
to comp.lang.c the longest, and who have been programming in C
for the longest and with the most success, keep saying "it's
undefined, it's undefined, quit worrying about why, just don't do
it, it's undefined", they might have a good reason, even if they
don't -- or can't -- say what is, and that might be a good enough
reason for you, too.
<p>
I've been programming in C for, oh, 15 years now.  For at least
10 of those years, I've been regarded as somewhat of an expert.
For going on 5 of those years, I've been maintaining the
comp.lang.c FAQ list.  I am someone who is usually incapable of
learning abstract facts unless I understand the reasons behind
them.  When I used to study for math tests, I wouldn't memorize
formulas, I'd just make sure that I could rederive them if I
needed them.  Yet for most of the 15 years I've been programming
in C, I simply could not have told you why <code>i=i++</code> is undefined.
It's an ugly expression; it's meaningless to me; I don't know
what it does; I don't want to know what it does; I'd never write
it; I don't understand why anyone would write it; it's a mystery
to me why anyone cares what it does; if I ever encountered it in
code I was maintaining, I'd rewrite it.  When I was learning C
from K&amp;R1 in 1980 or whenever it was, one of their nice little
sentences, which they only say once, and which if you miss you're
sunk, leaped up off the page and wrapped itself around my brain
and has never let go:
<blockquote>
Naturally, it is necessary to know what things to avoid,
but if you don't know <em>how</em> they are done on various
machines, that innocence may help to protect you.
</blockquote>
As it happens, it's possible to read K&amp;R <em>too</em> carefully here:
the discussion at the end of chapter 2 about <code>a[i] = i++</code> suggests
that it's implementation-defined, and the word "unspecified"
appears in K&amp;R2, while ANSI says that the behavior is undefined.
The sentence I've quoted above suggests not knowing how things
are done on various machines, while in fact what we really want
to know is that maybe they <em>can't</em> be done on various machines.
Nevertheless, the message -- that a bit of innocence may do you
good -- is in this case a good one.
<p>
That's my first answer.  I realize that it's wholly unsatisfying
to anyone who's still interested in this question.  On to answer
number two.
<p>
<pre>
&gt; As far as I know, it was created by a committee not brought down by Moses
&gt; from the mountain top.  If I want to become a better C programmer, won't
&gt; it help me to know why the committee acted as it did.
</pre>
<p>
Perhaps, but again, only if you're very careful.
<p>
Let's say you're wondering why <code>i++ * i++</code> is undefined.  Someone
explains that it's because no one felt like defining which order
the side effects happen in.  That's a nice answer: it's a bit
incomplete and perhaps a bit incorrect, but it's certainly easy
to understand, and since you insisted on an answer you could
understand (as opposed to something inscrutable like "it's just
undefined; don't do it"), it's the kind of answer you're likely
to get.
<p>
So next week, you find yourself writing something like
<pre>
	i = 7;
	printf("%d\n", i++ * i++);
</pre>
and you say to yourself, "Whoah, that might be undefined.
How did that explanation go again?  It's undefined... because
nobody felt like saying... which order the side effects happened
in.  So either the first <code>i</code> gets incremented first, and it's 7
times 8 is 56, or the second <code>i</code> gets incremented first, and it's
8 times 7 is 56.  Hey!  It may be undefined, but I get a
predictable answer, so I can use the code after all!"
<p>
So in this case, knowing a reason why has not made you a better
programmer, it has made you a worse programmer, because some day
when you're not around to defend it (or when you are around, but
you don't have time to debug it), that code is going to print 49,
or maybe 42, or maybe "Floating point exception -- core dumped".
<p>
If, on the other hand, you didn't know why it was undefined,
just that it was undefined, you would have instead written
<pre>
	printf("%d\n", i * (i+1));
	i += 2;
</pre>
(or whatever it was that you meant), and your code would have
been portable, robust, and well-defined.
<p>
Now, some of you may be thinking that
<pre>
	printf("%d\n", i++ * i++);
</pre>
is a ridiculous example which no one would ever write.  That may
be true, but it's the example I use in the FAQ list (and it's the
oldest of the undefined-evaluation-order questions in the FAQ
list) because it illustrates, I hope better than a "real" example
would, the kind of contortions that people <em>do</em> get into when
they start thinking too hard (but not too carefully) about
undefined expressions.  There was an actual question posted to
comp.lang.c years ago (which I could probably find in my archives
if I looked hard enough) in which the poster used essentially the
same argument: "the evaluation order may be undefined, but no
matter which order the compiler picks, I'll get the answer I
want", and that was the inspiration for the <code>i++ * i++</code> question
(<a href="../../../c-faq.com/ptrs/mimic.html">4.2</a>
on the current list).  (Remember, it's not the evaluation
order that's undefined, it's the entire expression that's
undefined.)
<p>
Two paragraphs back, I suggested that the programmer who did not
know why something was undefined might have been better off than
the programmer who did.  I am not stating (not in the current
climate, anyway) that you should not know why things are
undefined.  But if you insist on knowing, you are going to have
to get the full story, not just some simplistic justifications.
And you are going to have to be excruciatingly careful that you
don't use your knowledge of why something is undefined to try to
second-guess how a certain undefined construct (which you've
decided you simply have to use in your program) is going to
behave.  Undefined behavior is slippery stuff: it really, truly
is undefined; it really, truly can do anything at all; yet some
people (particularly those who are always clamoring to know <em>why</em>
things are undefined) are always trying to salvage some remnants
of definedness out of an undefined situation, and are always
getting themselves in trouble, and end up convincing the people
who have to come along and pick up the mess that yes, it really
was a mistake trying to explain why it was undefined, and we
probably should have just said it was undefined because we said
it was, after all.
<p>
This has been answer number two, and I realize it's still not
satisfying, because I'm still suggesting that maybe you don't
want to know why.
<p>
For answer number three, I'll quit beating around the bush and
try to explain why, although I have to admit that, for me, the
answers from here on are going to get less satisfying, and less
nicely worded, because we get down into some realms that I don't
usually think about (because I really have taken to heart K&amp;R's
advice about maintaining some innocence).
<p>
An international Standard like X3.159/ISO-9899 is a tremendously
difficult document to write, even for a relatively simple
programming language like C.  When a Standard says something,
it must say it definitively and unambiguously.  (When it is
inaccurate, it must be definitively inaccurate, and when it
contains any areas of doubt or uncertainty, they must be rigidly
defined areas of doubt or uncertainty.)  The Standard must
withstand intense scrutiny, for many years, from all sorts of
observers, including language lawyers, professional nitpickers,
grudging ex-users of other languages, semicompetent implementors
of spiffola new compilers for scruffola old computers, and
xenophobic adherents of other sociopolitical systems.  (If you
think that abstract constructions like programming languages are
inherently removed from sociopolitical concerns, you haven't
followed the crafting of any international Standards.)
<p>
Since it's so hard to specify things precisely enough for a
Standard like this, the wise Standard-writer (especially for a
Standard that hews to existing practice) won't specify anything
more than is necessary.  Features that everyone will use (or that
someone might be reasonably expected to use) must be specified
precisely, but features that no sane person could be expected to
use in 6,000 years might be relegated to the dustbin, instead.
(Naturally, since we're being precise, we'll have to precisely
define the boundaries of the parts we've decided to be imprecise
about; the paraphrase above of Vroomfondel's demand from The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not facetious.)
<p>
In practice, you can only tell what a computer program has done
when it causes a side effect.  In a nutshell, then, what a
Standard for a programming language does is to define the mapping
between the programs you write and the side effects they produce.
Consequently, we are very concerned with side effects: how
they're expressed in our programs, and how the Standard defines
them to behave.
<p>
The fragment
<pre>
	int i;
	i = 7;
	printf("%d\n", i);
</pre>
contains two obvious side effects, and it is blatantly obvious
what their effect should be, and what the Standard says agrees
with what you think they should do.
<p>
The fragment
<pre>
	int a[10] = {0}, i = 1;
	i = i++;
	a[i] = i++;
	printf("%d %d %d %d\n", i, a[1], a[2], a[3]);
</pre>
contains a few more side effects, but (I assert) it is <em>not</em>
obvious how they should behave.  What does the second line do?
In the third line, do we decide which cell of <code>a[]</code> we assign to
before or after we increment <code>i</code> again?  Plenty of people can
probably come up with plenty of opinions of how this fragment
ought to work, but they probably won't all agree with each other,
as the situation is not nearly so clear-cut.
<p>
Furthermore, a Standard obviously cannot talk about individual
program fragments like <code>i = i++</code> and <code>a[i] = i++</code>, because there are
an infinite number of those.  It must make general prescriptions
about how the various primitive elements of the language behave,
which we then use in combination to determine how real programs
behave.  If you think you know what <code>a[i] = i++</code> should do, you
can't just say that; instead you have to come up with a general
statement which says how <em>all</em> expressions which modify and then
use the same object should act, and you have to convince yourself
that this rule is appropriate not only for the <code>a[i] = i++</code> case
you thought about but also for all the other expressions
(infinitely many of them, remember) that you did <em>not</em> think
about, <em>and</em> you have to convince a bunch of other people of your
conviction.
<p>
The people writing the C Standard decided that they could not do
that.  Instead, they decided that expressions such as <code>a[i] = i++</code>
and <code>i++ * i++</code> and <code>i = i++</code> would be undefined.  They decided this
because these expressions are too hard to define and too stupid
to be worth defining.  They came up with some definitions (no
small feat in itself) of which expressions this undefinedness
applies to.  You've seen these definitions; they're the ones
that say
<blockquote>
Between the previous and next sequence point an object
shall have its stored value modified at most once by the
evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore, the prior
value shall be accessed only to determine the value to
be stored.
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, I'll grant that these definitions are at least as hard to
understand as expressions such as <code>a[i] = i++</code>.  But there are
plenty of more complicated expressions which we can't begin to
make sense of (or even decide if they make any sense) without
these definitions.  Perhaps I'll say more about them later, but
for the moment we're still trying to answer the question of why
some things (such as the expressions not defined by the two
definitions quoted above) are undefined, and my opinion is, as I
stated above: because they're too hard to define, and too stupid
to be worth defining.  (If you're still counting, call this
answer number three.)
<p>
Now, you may think that I'm being overly pessimistic.  You may
think that it's easy to define what <code>a[i] = i++</code> or <code>i++ * i++</code> or
<code>i = i++</code> should do.  Perhaps you think they should be evaluated
in exactly the order suggested by precedence and associativity.
Perhaps you think that <code>i++</code> should increment <code>i</code> immediately after
giving up <code>i</code>'s value and before evaluating any of the rest of the
expression.  (These rules would say that the incremented value of
<code>i</code> is used to decide which cell of <code>a[]</code> to assign to, and that the
left-hand <code>i++</code> in <code>i++ * i++</code> happens first, and that <code>i = i++</code> ends
up -- here's a surprise -- being exactly equivalent to <code>i = i</code>,
unless perhaps if <code>i</code> is volatile.)  But -- and you're going to
have to take my word for it here, because I'm taking other
people's word for it -- these hypothetical "well-defined"
expression rules, though they're easy enough to state and
probably precise enough and probably comprehensive for the
cases we're interested in, would result in significantly poorer
performance than pre-ANSI C traditionally had and that we're
used to.  Optimizing compilers would have to generate code which
evaluated expressions in little itsy bitsy steps, in lockstep
with the precedence- and associativity-based parse.  They would
not be able to rearrange parts of the expression to make the best
use of the target machine's instruction repertoire or available
registers or pipelining or parallelization or whatnot.
<p>
When people talk about why it's good that an expression like
<code>i++ * i++</code> is undefined, they usually speak of modern, parallel
machines which might get really confused if they try to do, not
the left-hand <code>i++</code> first or the right-hand one first, but instead
both at once somehow.  Instead of that example, let's imagine a
very simple CPU, analogous to a four-function calculator with
some memory registers.  Let's play compiler, and imagine what
buttons on the calculator we'll push, operating under the
"well-defined" rules of the previous paragraph.
<p>
Since the (hypothetical) "well-defined" rules tell us exactly
which order to evaluate the expression in, our task is
straightforward.  First, the left-hand side of the multiplication
operator: the value we want to multiply is <code>i</code>'s previous value.
Whoops, before we can think about doing the multiplication, the
rules say we have to do the increment.  Whoops, once we do the
increment, we'll have lost the previous value.  So we recall
from <code>i</code>, store the value in a temporary register, add one to to
the value, and store it back in <code>i</code>.  Now we can recall from the
temporary, and do the multiplication... no.  Because first we
have to do the same thing on the right-hand side: recall from <code>i</code>,
store it in a second temporary, add one to it, and store it back
in <code>i</code>.  Now, finally, we can recall the two values from the two
temporaries and do the multiplication.
<p>
If we remove the (still hypothetical, just for the purposes of
this article, not part of Standard C) "well-defined" rules, and
revert to ANSI's rules, under which we only have to make sure
that the increments to <code>i</code> happen sometime before the next sequence
point, look how much easier things become: Recall from <code>i</code>.  Make a
note to increment its value later.  Multiply it by: recall from <code>i</code>
again, make a note to increment it later.  Now we've got the
product, do whatever we have to with it.  We've still got these
two notes to increment <code>i</code>, so handle them, and we're done.
<p>
I'd never actually gone through the analysis in this level of
detail until just now, but this is exactly how the example
<pre>
	int i = 7;
	printf("%d\n", i++ * i++);
</pre>
from <a href="../../../c-faq.com/ptrs/mimic.html">question 4.2</a>
 of the FAQ list could print 49 instead of 56.
(No, I'm not going to come up with a scenario under which it
could print 42.)
<p>
So, if you're still with me (and after 300 lines, I can see how
you might not be, but if you're one of the people who's been
insisting on a reason why, you better be <code>:-)</code> ), here is my
fourth, last answer: these things are undefined because if you
made them defined, compilers would have to be paranoid and
generate lockstep code which would be bulkier or slower or both.
<p>
Having come this far, I have to repeat that this last answer
isn't one I'm particularly pleased with, partly because I'm not a
code generation expert, and partly because I don't usually worry
about efficiency very much.  (On the other hand, it doesn't
matter whether I'm pleased with it, or whether you're pleased
with it either; it <em>is</em> one of the reasons.)  You're probably
also still harboring some doubts; you may be thinking that a
compiler would only have to use the slow, bulky, lockstep code
for expressions with multiple side effects, which many people
(even some of the Doubting Thomases) agree that we shouldn't be
writing anyway.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps we could have our
cake and eat it too; perhaps we could have blazingly efficient
code generated for polite little expressions and still have
defined behavior for rogue ones.  Perhaps we could, but not
under the current Standard: it still <em>does</em> say that the rogue
expressions are undefined.  But the C Standard is under revision:
perhaps, if this is important enough to you, you can convince the
committee to pronounce defined behavior upon the rogue
expressions, too.  Good luck.
