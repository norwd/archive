<h1>Portability and ANSI C Compliance -- a comp.lang.c Perspective</h1>
<p>
The general attitude in comp.lang.c is that portability and ANSI
C compliance are very, very important.  This focus can sometimes
seem overblown: commentators sometimes point out that in "the
real world", portability and standards compliance are not
necessarily paramount virtues, that a project under deadline
pressure which is targeted at only one platform anyway might not
be able to afford to worry about portability.
<p>
My own belief, which is consistent if not identical with the
comp.lang.c consensus, is otherwise.  I do think portability and
standards compliance matter a great deal, and furthermore that
they matter in actual practice, although in the interests of
strict intellectual honesty I have to confess that the plane I'm
arguing from is not always quite "real-world".  In fact, I go to
considerable lengths to maintain the self-imposed delusion that I
live in a fantasy world, one in which software is easy and fun to
write, and works right the first time; in which new features and
other improvements are easy to make; in which debugging is a rare
pastime.
<p>
It's also important to emphasize that we're talking about a lot
more than "ANSI C compliance" here.  In fact -- though it may
sound contradictory or even heretical -- strict ANSI C compliance
is in some sense a red herring.  It's nevertheless at least an
<em>important</em> red herring, however; more on this anon.
<p>
While I'm listing prefatory disclaimers, I'll also admit that I
don't expect to fully convince everyone.  The counterarguments,
which would suggest that portability and compliance don't matter
so much, are in very good company out there in the real world,
albeit it's that same real world where for whatever reason
software is painful and expensive to write, where programs never
work correctly the first time and in many cases never work
perfectly at all, where bugs and gratuitous complexity tend
inexorably to become so ossified that it's impossible to fix them
or to add new features without adding yet more bugs, and where
debugging tends to account for far more time than actually
writing code.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I'd like to think we can do
better...
<p>
<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>
<p>
First of all, no one is claiming that 100% of every useful
program must be written in 100% strictly conforming ANSI/ISO C.
The claims are merely that as much as possible should be written
in ANSI/ISO C, that the system-dependent portions which cannot be
written portably should be very cleanly separated, and finally
that the proportion of system-independent to system-dependent
code can be much larger than is necessarily always acknowledged.
If you can't make all of a large program standards-compliant,
with some effort you can make <em>most</em> of it compliant, and the
effort is usually well worth it.
<p>
<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>
<p>
Even when portability is no market requirement, it can be hugely
advantageous to write a program portably, anyway, if it makes the
development easier.  I was once hired to make extensions to a
piece of embedded software, and the first thing I did was to port
it from its native environment (a stripped-down version of
MS-DOS) to Linux, and write a quick-and-dirty curses-based
replacement for its original machine-dependent user interface.
That port probably cost me a day or two of work, but the payback
was handsome and immediate, because it made <em>everything</em> else so
much easier; I'm sure I worked 2-3 times as efficiently during
the 6-8 weeks that the rest of the project lasted as I could have
if I'd tried to do all my development under MS-DOS and all my
testing on the actual embedded device.
<p>
This is another of those arguments which I'm sure seems utterly
unconvincing (because it's so unbelievable) to many observers out
there in the real world where software is painful and expensive
to write.  If every line of code comes dear, it might seem
inconceivable to spend additional time writing an entire
Unix-compatible curses-based user interface for an embedded
program, when that interface will be thrown away when the coding
is complete, never to be seen by a paying customer.  "Why would
you even think of wasting time writing it, when we're already so
far behind on all the product-specific code we <em>have</em> to write?
And of what benefit is being able to test the program under *nix,
when obviously all of our formal testing has to be on the target
device since that's where the end users will be using it?
Why are you so het up about trying to do your development under
Unix?  Are you one of those Unix bigots or something?  I think
you're just too lazy and set in your ways to learn how to program
in DOS."
<p>
Those counterarguments aren't completely invalid, and I'm probably
poking a bit more fun at them here than is strictly fair, but
they're made by people who don't understand the difference that
a development environment can make, who don't appreciate the
orders-of-magnitude differences in productivity between mediocre
programmers using mediocre development environments versus good
programmers using great ones.  (And, incidentally, they don't
understand that a certain kind of motivated, directed laziness
is a very great virtue in programming.  Me, I'll bend 'way over
backwards, and run around the barn three times, and stay up all
night coding, to set up some key piece of infrastructure that
will let me be completely slack-off lazy for the entire rest of
the project.)

<p>
Up above I admitted that ANSI C compliance was in some sense a red
herring, albeit an important one.  Now I'll start trying to
explain what I meant.
<p>
"ANSI C" is partly a code-word for "the high-quality code we
advocate here, as opposed to the junk everybody else puts up
with."  Now, on the one hand it's true that, strictly speaking,
ANSI C compliance might not seem to be nearly as much of a "hard"
market requirement as the "really important" market imperatives
such as efficiency and featurefulness.  But there are
nevertheless a number of things that thinking about ANSI C
compliance forces you to do.
<p>
One is that it forces you to cleanly separate those parts of your
program that can be portable from those that can't be.  And it
turns out that this is quite often a <em>really</em> <em>good</em> exercise to
go through anyway, even if the can-be-portable part never ends up
being ported off of its initial development environment at all.
The reason is that although everyone understands that Modularity
is Good, not everyone always manages to actually write code that
is particularly well modularized.  The user interface code tends
to end up being tightly intertwined with the data processing
code, and the data processing code tends to get all tangled up
with the OS- or database-access code.  And the result is that
there end up being all sorts of things that would be "nice"
to do, that you can't.  You can't write a noninteractive test
harness that exercises the 80-90% of the program that does
involve data processing but doesn't involve the user interface,
because you can't separate that portion of the program from the
user interface.  When the database access code isn't working,
you can't put in a single, simple debug printout at the one spot
where all database access calls funnel through, because there
isn't that one spot, because ad-hoc database access calls are
scattered all over.  When focus group testing shows that the
workflow implied by the existing user interface is awkward and
confusing to users and should be significantly reworked, you
can't afford to, because it would require rewriting too much of
the intertwined, non-user-interface, data processing code as
well.  And so on.
<p>
If, on the other hand, a project is developed with a "do as much
of it as possible in ANSI C" mantra, it goes hand in hand with a
"modularize it properly" mantra, because for the most part the
pure data processing code, that it would be nice to keep
separated from the user interface and the OS interface, is
precisely the part that can be written strictly portably.
<p>
Abilities like bolting on an alternative, noninteractive user
interface "just for testing", or tracing all database access
calls "just for convenience during debugging", might seem like
luxuries, or mere niceties.  But in successful projects,
"luxuries" like these are easy to come by, because they are
synergistic with -- simultaneously enabled by and further
contributing to -- the very same high qualities that are making
the project successful.  In other words, in successful projects,
"expensive luxuries" like these are not expensive and not
luxuries.  They are bona-fide requirements in order for the
project to be successful, and their cost is therefore well,
well worth it.
<p>
<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>
<p>
Though I hope it was at least somewhat convincing, the preceding
argument has a bit of a disciplinarian, drink-your-cod-liver-oil-
it's-good-for-you feel to it.  Dusty crusty academicians come up
with all sorts of reasons why learning Latin is Good For You
because it Clarifies your Thought Processes even though nobody
speaks it any more.  Me, I don't know any Latin, but I'm afraid
I might sound about as crusty for claiming that writing ANSI C
is beneficial even if you don't care about portability, just
because it will force you to write better, more modular code.
Here's a perhaps more compelling argument.
<p>
Assume for the moment that we do care about ANSI C compliance
in those parts of the program that can be made portable.  Assume
that we're willing to tolerate nonportable system dependencies in
the remainder of the program.  Assume that we have gone through
the exercise of cleanly separating those parts of the program
that can be made portable from those that can't be.  Now, what
sorts of strict ANSI C violations, or other nonportabilities,
is our finished program likely to contain?
<p>
Obviously, the can't-be-made-portable portions of the program
will be full of nonportabilities, that's the whole point.
In those parts of the code, for each noncompliant aspect that
a nitpicker or naysayer might point at, there isn't an ANSI C
alternative, so it's hardly worth complaining.
<p>
But in the allegedly-portable, system-independent parts of the
program, the situation is obviously quite different.  If we find
ourselves comparing two different ways of writing some piece of
pure data processing code, what can we say about the
possibilities, and about our preferences for choosing one over
the other?  If one of the ways is not ANSI conforming, here we
will usually find that there <em>is</em> a conforming alternative.
Given that choice, why would anyone argue for the nonconforming
alternative?  I'm sorry to sound harsh, but I think the arguments
in favor of the nonconforming option here basically reduce to:
ignorance.  If you don't know about the conforming alternative,
that's one thing, but having been presented with it, if you
insist on continuing to do it your old way, because it's "more
efficient" or it's "what you're used to" or because the resulting
alleged nonportability "doesn't matter in this case", you're
probably being willfully stubborn.
<p>
But it's even worse than that.  In the nonportable parts of the
program, you had no choice but to go with the system-dependent
implementations; there were no alternatives.  Having gone with
the necessarily system-dependent, unavoidably unportable
alternative, the potential failure mode is only the one we
already knew about: it's not portable.
<p>
In the nominally portable parts of the program, on the other
hand, anything nonstandard you're making use of -- that is,
any departure from Standard-conforming C -- is likely to be
a compiler extension or an instance of undefined behavior.
(Actually, by one definition they're the same thing.)
You might make an informed decision to adopt and depend on a
compiler extension, but far more worrisome are those instances
of undefined behavior.
<p>
That instance of undefined behavior, that you thought you could
live with, that worked fine for you last week, might stop working
next week, for no reason at all, or because you installed a new
release of the compiler, or changed a compilation option, or
switched to daylight saving time, or tried to run the program on
a bigger problem, or with more or less memory available to it,
or for a million other but-what-difference-can-that-make reasons.
That quirky aspect of C that you weren't sure about, that you
empirically determined worked a certain way based on a quick test
program that you wrote, and that you then made use of in 37
different places in the larger system that you can't remember all
of and can't definitively grep for, turns out not to always work
the way you thought it did, after all, because your empirical
testing was unwittingly incomplete.
<p>
(Me, I tend to be pretty paranoid about those nifty-keen but
utterly nonstandard vendor extensions, too, because the more
enticing and compelling they are, the easier it is for them to be
be twisted by the vendor into a shackle that forces you to keep
using that vendor after they've incongruously become Totally
Evil, and you find you'd rather wean yourself from them after
all, except now you can't.)
<p>
In any case, the point here is that when a departure from
Standard conformance is an instance of undefined behavior, the
potential failure mode is reasonably dire: the program could stop
working tomorrow, for whatever reason, even though it seemed to
pass its test suite with flying colors today, inspiring you to go
ahead and release it to the customers tonight.  And it seems to
me that if you say you don't care about the Standard and that you
can live with departures from it, many of your departures will
end up in this category.
<p>

<p>
Finally, here's the other half of the "red herring" explanation.
To some extent, talking about ANSI C compliance is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">shibboleth</a>.
There's a worrisome sort of class distinction in programming
between programmers who are satisfied with code that seems to
work, versus programmers who insist on code that works <em>for the
right reasons</em>.  Unfortunately, of course, just because some code
does work you don't necessarily know whether it's working for the
right reasons or the wrong reasons.  Code that merely seems to
work today can just as easily stop working tomorrow, leading to
neverending bug-chasing.  Code that works for the right reasons,
on the other hand, has some decent chance of continuing to work
properly tomorrow and next week and next month and next year,
<em>without</em> continual hands-on maintenance (meaning among other
things that the programmers involved are free to move on to new
and different projects).
<p>
Here's what I mean by the shibboleth: programmers who insist
that code work for the right reasons can't help but be zealous
advocates of the ANSI C Standard, because it's unquestionably
the biggest and strongest Right Reason that there is for C code
to work.  So programmers who care that code works for the right
reasons also care about (and think about, and talk about)
the C Standard, whether or not they have portability as a job
requirement.  Programmers who are looking for excuses to ignore
the Standard, on the other hand (because, they claim, it's
irrelevant to their work), are likely to be the ones who are
satisfied with code that seems to work at the end of the day --
but that's an attitude that likely entails ignoring all sorts of
other seemingly-irrelevant details, details that are irrelevant
only because they have to do with something other than getting
the code to work this minute.  And that's obviously an attitude
that can end up causing all sorts of other problems, too.
<p>
<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>
<p>
Programmers who say that they "can't afford" to worry about
portability may admit that it's theoretically important, but claim that
it's overshadowed by other, more pressing concerns.  What with
everything else they've got to worry about -- the schedule, the
bug list, the difficulty of cleanly introducing new features into
code that's been sullied by too many expediency-mandated hacks
upon hacks -- it may seem like ANSI C compliance isn't even on
the table.
<p>
To my way of thinking, though, there's a real connection here.
Code which is sullied by hacks upon hacks, or which suffers from
a lack of coherent design, is code which someone tried to get
working by hook or by crook, and where the definition of
"working" was probably "seems to work at the end of the day".
The only way I know of to get out of that trap is to start paying
attention to coding styles and development attitudes which
feature the virtue of code that works for the right reasons --
and ANSI C is very much on that table.
<p>
<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>
<p>
I'm sorry that the folks in comp.lang.c tend to come across as
Standard-thumping fundamentalists, continuing to insist, with
ramrod-straight demeanor, that all code be strictly conforming,
as if it's only important for its own sake.  But the insistence
is <em>not</em> merely for its own sake: much more importantly, it's for
the sake of code that's <em>correct</em>, not just in the ANSI C Standard
sense, but in the much more important "works reliably in the real
world" sense.  As I had occasion to write once before when this
issue came up, "I'm not a Standard-thumping fundamentalist who
worships at the altar of X3J11 because I'm an anal-retentive
dweeb who loves pouncing on people who innocently post code
containing void main() to comp.lang.c; I'm a Standard-thumping
fundamentalist who worships at the altar of X3J11 because it
gives me eminently useful guarantees about the programs I write
and helps me ensure that they'll work correctly next week and
next month and next year, in environments I haven't heard of or
can't imagine or that haven't been invented yet, and without
continual hands-on bugfixing and coddling by me."
