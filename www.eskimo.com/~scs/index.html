<h1>Steve Summit's home page</h1>
<p>
I maintain the Usenet <a href="http://c-faq.com/">comp.lang.c FAQ list</a>.
<br>
It's also available as a
<a href="../../c-faq.com/book/index.html">book</a>.
<br>
I
used to
teach a pair of <a href="cclass/cclass.html">C programming classes</a>,
and their
<a href="cclass/cclass.html">notes</a>
are all
on line.
<br>
(More
<a href="C.html">information about C</a>.)
<p>
Some <a href="https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/src/">programs and other source code</a> I've written
that might be useful to you.
<p>
A <a href="dmr.html">remembrance</a> of the late Dennis Ritchie.
<p>
Other
<a href="readings/index2.html">stuff I've written</a>
(mostly C-related Usenet posts).
<p>
The ISP hosting this page
and where I receive my e-mail,
<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/">eskimo.com</a>,
is a rare and special one,
perfect for my needs.
If you're looking for an ISP
that gives you the access you need
(including Unix shells)
without getting in your way
or charging too much,
check it out.
