<H2>10.2 Pointers and Arrays; Pointer Arithmetic</H2>

<p>[This section corresponds to K&amp;R Sec. 5.3]
</p><p>Pointers do not have to point to single variables.
They can also point at the cells of an array.
For example, we can write
<pre>
	int *ip;
	int a[10];
	ip = &amp;a[3];
</pre>
and we would end up with
<TT>ip</TT> pointing at the fourth cell of the array <TT>a</TT>
(remember, arrays are 0-based, so <TT>a[0]</TT> is the first cell).
We could illustrate the situation like this:
<br>
<center><img src="p6.gif"></center>
<br>
We'd use this <TT>ip</TT> just like the one in the previous section:
<TT>*ip</TT> gives us what <TT>ip</TT> points to,
which in this case will be the value in <TT>a[3]</TT>.
</p><p>Once we have a pointer pointing into an array,
we can start doing <dfn>pointer arithmetic</dfn>.
Given that <TT>ip</TT> is a pointer to <TT>a[3]</TT>,
we can add 1 to <TT>ip</TT>:
<pre>
	ip + 1
</pre>
What does it mean to add one to a pointer?
In C,
it gives a pointer to the cell one farther on,
which in this case is <TT>a[4]</TT>.
To make this clear,
let's
assign this new pointer to another pointer variable:
<pre>
	ip2 = ip + 1;
</pre>
Now the picture looks like this:
<br>
<center><img src="p7.gif"></center>
<br>
If we now do
<pre>
	*ip2 = 4;
</pre>
we've set <TT>a[4]</TT> to 4.
But it's not necessary to assign a new pointer value to a pointer variable
in order to use it;
we could also compute a new pointer value and
use it immediately:
<pre>
	*(ip + 1) = 5;
</pre>
In this last example,
we've changed <TT>a[4]</TT> again,
setting it to 5.
The parentheses are needed
because the unary ``contents of'' operator <TT>*</TT>
has higher <dfn>precedence</dfn>
(i.e., binds more tightly than)
the addition operator.
If we wrote <TT>*ip + 1</TT>,
without the parentheses,
we'd be fetching the value pointed to by <TT>ip</TT>,
and adding 1 to that value.
The expression <TT>*(ip + 1)</TT>,
on the other hand,
accesses the value one past the one pointed to by <TT>ip</TT>.
</p><p>Given that we can add 1 to a pointer,
it's not surprising
that we can add and subtract other numbers as well.
If <TT>ip</TT> still points to <TT>a[3]</TT>, then
<pre>
	*(ip + 3) = 7;
</pre>
sets <TT>a[6]</TT> to 7, and
<pre>
	*(ip - 2) = 4;
</pre>
sets <TT>a[1]</TT> to 4.
</p><p>Up above,
we added 1 to <TT>ip</TT> and assigned the new pointer to <TT>ip2</TT>,
but there's no reason we can't add one to a pointer,
and change the same pointer:
<pre>
	ip = ip + 1;
</pre>
Now <TT>ip</TT> points one past where it used to
(to <TT>a[4]</TT>, if we hadn't changed it in the meantime).
The shortcuts we learned in a previous chapter
all work for pointers, too:
we could also increment a pointer using
<pre>
	ip += 1;
</pre>
or
<pre>
	ip++;
</pre>
</p><p>Of course, pointers are not limited to <TT>int</TT>s.
It's quite common to use pointers to other types,
especially <TT>char</TT>.
Here is the body of the <TT>mystrcmp</TT> function
we saw in a previous chapter,
rewritten to use pointers.
(<TT>mystrcmp</TT>,
you may recall,
compares two strings, character by character.)
<pre>
	char *p1 = &amp;str1[0], *p2 = &amp;str2[0];

	while(1)
		{
		if(*p1 != *p2)
			return *p1 - *p2;
		if(*p1 == '\0' || *p2 == '\0')
			return 0;
		p1++;
		p2++;
		}
</pre>
</p><p>The autoincrement operator <TT>++</TT>
(like its companion, <TT>--</TT>)
makes it easy to do two things at once.
We've seen idioms like <TT>a[i++]</TT>
which accesses <TT>a[i]</TT> and simultaneously increments <TT>i</TT>,
leaving it referencing the next cell of the array <TT>a</TT>.
We can do the same thing with pointers:
an expression like <TT>*ip++</TT>
lets us access what <TT>ip</TT> points to,
while simultaneously incrementing <TT>ip</TT>
so that it points to the next element.
The preincrement form works, too:
<TT>*++ip</TT> increments <TT>ip</TT>,
then accesses what it points to.
Similarly,
we can use notations like <TT>*ip--</TT> and <TT>*--ip</TT>.
</p><p>As another example,
here is the <TT>strcpy</TT>
(string copy)
loop from a previous chapter,
rewritten to use pointers:
<pre>
	char *dp = &amp;dest[0], *sp = &amp;src[0];
	while(*sp != '\0')
		*dp++ = *sp++;
	*dp = '\0';
</pre>
</p><p>(One question that comes up
is whether the expression <TT>*p++</TT>
increments <TT>p</TT> or what it points to.
The answer is that it increments
<TT>p</TT>.

To
increment what <TT>p</TT> points to,
you can use <TT>(*p)++</TT>.)
</p><p>When you're doing pointer arithmetic,
you have to remember how big the array the pointer points into is,
so that you don't ever point outside it.
If the array <TT>a</TT> has 10 elements,
you can't access <TT>a[50]</TT> or <TT>a[-1]</TT> or even <TT>a[10]</TT>
(remember,
the valid subscripts for a 10-element array run from 0 to 9).
Similarly, if <TT>a</TT> has 10 elements and <TT>ip</TT> points to <TT>a[3]</TT>,
you can't compute or access <TT>ip + 10</TT> or <TT>ip - 5</TT>.
(There is one special case:

you can,
in this case,
compute, but not access,
a pointer to the nonexistent element just beyond the end of the array,
which in this case is <TT>&amp;a[10]</TT>.
This becomes useful when you're doing pointer comparisons,
which we'll look at next.)
