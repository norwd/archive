<H2>2.7 Function Calls</H2>

<p>We'll have much more to say about functions in a later chapter,
but for now let's just look at how they're called.
(To review: what a function <em>is</em> is a piece of code, 
written by you or by someone else, which
performs some useful, compartmentalizable task.)
You call a function by mentioning its name followed by a pair 
of parentheses.
If the function takes any arguments, you place the arguments 
between the parentheses, separated by commas.
These are all function calls:
<pre>
	printf("Hello, world!\n")
	printf("%d\n", i)
	sqrt(144.)
	getchar()
</pre>
The arguments to a function can be arbitrary expressions.
Therefore, you don't have to say things like
<pre>
	int sum = a + b + c;
	printf("sum = %d\n", sum);
</pre>
if you don't want to;
you can instead collapse it to
<pre>
	printf("sum = %d\n", a + b + c);
</pre>
Many functions return values, and when they do, you can embed 
calls to these functions within larger expressions:
<pre>
	c = sqrt(a * a + b * b)
	x = r * cos(theta)
	i = f1(f2(j))
</pre>
The first expression squares <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT>,
computes the square root of the sum of the squares,
and assigns the result to <TT>c</TT>.
(In other words,
it computes <TT>a * a + b * b</TT>,
passes that number to the <TT>sqrt</TT> function,
and assigns <TT>sqrt</TT>'s return value to <TT>c</TT>.)
The second expression passes the value of the variable <TT>theta</TT> to 
the <TT>cos</TT> (cosine) function,
multiplies the result by <TT>r</TT>,
and assigns the result to <TT>x</TT>.
The third expression
passes the value of the variable <TT>j</TT> to the function <TT>f2</TT>,
passes the return value of <TT>f2</TT>
immediately to the function <TT>f1</TT>,
and finally assigns <TT>f1</TT>'s return value to the variable <TT>i</TT>.
