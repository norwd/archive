<H1>Chapter 7: More Operators</H1>

<p>In this chapter we'll meet some
(though still not all)
of C's more advanced arithmetic operators.
The ones we'll meet here have to do with making common patterns of
operations easier.
</p><p>It's extremely common in programming to have to
<dfn>increment</dfn> a variable by 1, that is, to add 1 to it.
(For example, if you're processing each element of an array,
you'll typically write a loop with an index or pointer variable
stepping through the elements of the array,
and you'll increment the variable each time through the loop.)
The classic way to increment a variable is with an assignment like
<pre>
	i = i + 1
</pre>
Such an assignment is perfectly common and acceptable, but it 
has a few slight problems:
<OL><li>As we've mentioned, it looks a little odd,
especially from an algebraic perspective.
<li>If the object being incremented is
not a simple variable,
the idiom can become cumbersome to type,
and correspondingly more error-prone.
For example, the expression
<pre>
	a[i+j+2*k] = a[i+j+2*k] + 1
</pre>
is a bit of a mess,
and you may have to look closely to see that the
similar-looking
expression
<pre>
	a[i+j+2*k] = a[i+j+2+k] + 1
</pre>
probably has
a mistake in it.
<li>Since incrementing
things

is <em>so</em> common,
it might be nice to have an easier way of doing it.
</OL>In fact,
C provides not one but two other,
simpler ways of incrementing
variables
and
performing other
similar
operations.
