<H2>Standard Library Functions</H2>

<p>C's standard library contains many features and functions
which we haven't seen.
</p><p>We've seen many of <TT>printf</TT>'s formatting capabilities,
but not all.
Besides format specifier characters for a few types we haven't seen,

you can also control the width, precision,
justification (left or right)
and a few other attributes of <TT>printf</TT>'s format conversions.
(In their full complexity,
<TT>printf</TT> formats are about as elaborate and powerful
as FORTRAN <TT>format</TT> statements.)
</p><p>A <TT>scanf</TT> function lets you do ``formatted input''
analogous to <TT>printf</TT>'s formatted output.
<TT>scanf</TT> reads from the standard input;
a variant <TT>fscanf</TT> reads from a specified file pointer.
</p><p>The
<TT>sprintf</TT> and <TT>sscanf</TT>
functions
let you
``print'' and ``read''
to and from in-memory strings instead of files.
We've seen that <TT>atoi</TT> lets you convert a numeric
string into an integer;
the inverse operation can be performed with <TT>sprintf</TT>:
<pre>
	int i = 10;
	char str[10];
	sprintf(str, "%d", i);
</pre>
</p><p>We've used <TT>printf</TT> and <TT>fprintf</TT> to write formatted output,
and <TT>getchar</TT>, <TT>getc</TT>, <TT>putchar</TT>, and <TT>putc</TT>
to read and write characters.
There are also functions
<TT>gets</TT>, <TT>fgets</TT>, <TT>puts</TT>, and <TT>fputs</TT>
for reading and writing lines
(though we rarely need these,
especially if we're using our own <TT>getline</TT>
and maybe <TT>fgetline</TT>),
and also <TT>fread</TT> and <TT>fwrite</TT>
for reading or writing arbitrary numbers of characters.
</p><p>It's possible to ``un-read'' a character,
that is,
to push it back on an input stream, with <TT>ungetc</TT>.
(This is useful if you accidentally read one character too far,
and would prefer that some other part of your program
read that character instead.)
</p><p>You can use the
<TT>ftell</TT>, <TT>fseek</TT>, and <TT>rewind</TT> functions
to jump around in files,
performing random access (as opposed to sequential) I/O.
</p><p>The <TT>feof</TT> and <TT>ferror</TT> functions will tell you
whether you got <TT>EOF</TT> due to an actual end-of-file
condition or due to a read error of some sort.
You can clear errors and end-of-file conditions with
<TT>clearerr</TT>.
</p><p>You can open files in ``binary'' mode, or for
simultaneous

reading and writing.
(These options involve extra characters
appended to <TT>fopen</TT>'s mode string:
<TT>b</TT> for binary,
<TT>+</TT> for read/write.)
</p><p>There are several more string functions in <TT>&lt;string.h&gt;</TT>.
A second set of string functions
<TT>strncpy</TT>, <TT>strncat</TT>, and <TT>strncmp</TT>
all
accept a third argument telling them to
stop after <TT>n</TT> characters
if they haven't found the <TT>\0</TT> marking the end of the string.
A third set of ``<TT>mem</TT>'' functions,
including <TT>memcpy</TT> and <TT>memcmp</TT>,
operate on blocks of memory
which aren't necessarily strings
and where <TT>\0</TT> is not treated as a terminator.
The <TT>strchr</TT> and <TT>strrchr</TT> functions
find characters in strings.
There is a motley collection
of ``span'' and ``scan'' functions,
<TT>strspn</TT>, <TT>strcspn</TT>, and <TT>strpbrk</TT>,
for searching out or skipping over sequences of characters all 
drawn from a specified set of characters.
The <TT>strtok</TT> function aids in breaking up a string
into words or ``tokens,''
much like our own <TT>getwords</TT> function.
</p><p>The header file <TT>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</TT> contains several functions
which let you classify and manipulate characters:
check for letters or digits,
convert between upper- and lower-case,
etc.
</p><p>A host of mathematical functions
are defined in the header file <TT>&lt;math.h&gt;</TT>.
(As we've mentioned, besides including <TT>&lt;math.h&gt;</TT>,
you may on some Unix systems
have to ask for a special library containing the math functions
while compiling/linking.)
</p><p>There's a random-number generator, <TT>rand</TT>,
and a way to ``seed'' it, <TT>srand</TT>.
<TT>rand</TT> returns integers from 0 up to <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>
(where <TT>RAND_MAX</TT> is a constant
<TT>#define</TT>d in <TT>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT>).
One way of getting random integers from 1 to <TT>n</TT> is to call
<pre>
	(int)(rand() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0) * n) + 1
</pre>
Another way is
<pre>
	rand() / (RAND_MAX / n + 1) + 1
</pre>
It seems like it would be simpler to just say
<pre>
	rand() % n + 1
</pre>
but this method is imperfect
(or rather, it's imperfect if
<TT>n</TT> is a power of two
and
your system's implementation of <TT>rand()</TT> is imperfect,
as all too many of them are).
</p><p>Several functions let you interact with
the operating system under which your program is running.
The <TT>exit</TT> function
returns control to the operating system immediately,
terminating your program
and returning an ``exit status.''
The <TT>getenv</TT> function allows you to read
your operating system's
or process's
``environment variables''
(if any).
The <TT>system</TT> function
allows you to invoke an operating-system command
(i.e. another program)
from within your program.
</p><p>The <TT>qsort</TT> function allows you to sort an array
(of any type);
you supply a comparison function
(via a function pointer)
which knows how to compare two array elements,
and <TT>qsort</TT> does the rest.
The <TT>bsearch</TT> function allows you to
search for elements in sorted arrays;
it, too, operates in terms of a caller-supplied comparison function.
</p><p>Several functions--<TT>time</TT>,
<TT>asctime</TT>,
<TT>gmtime</TT>,
<TT>localtime</TT>,
<TT>asctime</TT>,
<TT>mktime</TT>,
<TT>difftime</TT>,
and
<TT>strftime</TT>--allow
you to determine the current date and time,
print dates and times,
and perform other date/time manipulations.
For example, to print today's date in a program,
you can write
<pre>
	#include &lt;time.h&gt;

	time_t now;
	now = time((time_t *)NULL);
	printf("It's %.24s", ctime(&amp;now));
</pre>
</p><p>The header file <TT>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</TT> lets you manipulate
variable-length function argument lists
(such as the ones <TT>printf</TT> is called with).
Additional members of the <TT>printf</TT> family of functions
let you write your own functions which accept
<TT>printf</TT>-like format specifiers and
variable numbers of arguments but call on the
standard <TT>printf</TT> to do most of the work.
</p><p>There are facilities for dealing with
multibyte and ``wide'' characters and strings,
for use with multinational character sets.
