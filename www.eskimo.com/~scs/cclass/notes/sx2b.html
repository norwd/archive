<H2>2.2 Constants</H2>

<p>[This section corresponds to K&amp;R Sec. 2.3]
</p><p></p><p>A <dfn>constant</dfn> is just an immediate, absolute value
found in an expression.
The simplest constants are decimal integers,
e.g. <TT>0</TT>, <TT>1</TT>, <TT>2</TT>, <TT>123</TT>
.
Occasionally it is useful to specify constants in base 8 or base 16
(octal or hexadecimal);
this is done by prefixing an extra <TT>0</TT> (zero) for octal,
or <TT>0x</TT> for hexadecimal:
the constants <TT>100</TT>, <TT>0144</TT>, and <TT>0x64</TT>
all represent the same number.
(If you're not using these non-decimal constants,
just remember not to use any leading zeroes.
If you accidentally write <TT>0123</TT>
intending to get one hundred and twenty three,
you'll get 83 instead, which is
123 base 8.)
</p><p>We write constants in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal
for our convenience,
not the compiler's.
The compiler doesn't care;
it always converts everything into binary internally, anyway.
(There is, however,
no good way to specify constants in source code in binary.)
</p><p>A constant can be forced to be of type <TT>long int</TT>
by suffixing it with the letter <TT>L</TT>
(in upper or lower case, although upper case is strongly 
recommended, because a lower case <TT>l</TT> looks too much like 
the digit <TT>1</TT>).
</p><p>A constant that contains a decimal point or the letter
<TT>e</TT> (or both) is a floating-point constant:
<TT>3.14</TT>, <TT>10.</TT>, <TT>.01</TT>,
<TT>123e4</TT>, <TT>123.456e7</TT>
.
The <TT>e</TT> indicates multiplication by a power of 10;
<TT>123.456e7</TT>
is
123.456
times 10 to the 7th,
or
1,234,560,000.
(Floating-point constants are of type <TT>double</TT> by default.)
</p><p>We also have constants for specifying characters and strings.
(Make sure you understand the difference between a character
and a string:
a character is exactly one character;
a string is a set of zero or more characters;
a string containing one character is distinct from a lone character.)
A character constant is simply a single character between
single quotes: <TT>'A'</TT>, <TT>'.'</TT>, <TT>'%'</TT>.
The numeric value of a character constant is,
naturally enough,
that character's value in the machine's character set.
(In ASCII, for example, <TT>'A'</TT> has the value 65.)
</p><p>A <dfn>string</dfn> is represented in C as a
sequence or
array of characters.
(We'll have more to say about arrays in general,
and strings in particular, later.)
A string constant is a sequence of zero or more characters
enclosed in double quotes:
<TT>"apple"</TT>,
<TT>"hello, world"</TT>,
<TT>"this is a test"</TT>.
</p><p>Within character and string constants,
the backslash character <TT>\</TT> is special,
and is used to represent characters
not easily typed on the keyboard
or for various reasons not easily typed in constants.
The most common of these ``character escapes'' are:
<br>
<br>
<pre>
	<TT>\n</TT>	a ``newline'' character
	<TT>\b</TT>	a backspace
	<TT>\r</TT>	a carriage return (without a line feed)
	<TT>\'</TT>	a single quote (e.g. in a character constant)
	<TT>\"</TT>	a double quote (e.g. in a string constant)
	<TT>\\</TT>	a single backslash
</pre>
</p><p>For example,
<TT>"he said \"hi\""</TT> is a string constant
which contains two double quotes,
and
<TT>'\''</TT> is a character constant consisting of a
(single)
single quote.
Notice once again that the character constant <TT>'A'</TT>
is very different from the string constant <TT>"A"</TT>.
