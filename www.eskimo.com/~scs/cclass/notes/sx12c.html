<H2>12.3 Predefined Streams</H2>

<p>Besides the file pointers which we explicitly open by calling <TT>fopen</TT>,
there are also three predefined streams.
<TT>stdin</TT> is a constant file pointer corresponding to standard input,
and <TT>stdout</TT> is
a constant file pointer corresponding to standard output.
Both of these can be used anywhere a file pointer is called for;
for example,
<TT>getchar()</TT> is the same as <TT>getc(stdin)</TT>
and <TT>putchar(c)</TT> is the same as <TT>putc(c, stdout)</TT>.
The third predefined stream is <TT>stderr</TT>.
Like <TT>stdout</TT>,
<TT>stderr</TT> is typically connected to the screen by default.
The difference is that <TT>stderr</TT> is not redirected
when the standard output is redirected.
For example,
under Unix or MS-DOS,
when you invoke
<pre>
	program &gt; filename
</pre>
anything printed to <TT>stdout</TT>
is redirected to the file <TT>filename</TT>,
but anything printed to <TT>stderr</TT> still goes to the screen.
The intent behind <TT>stderr</TT> is
that it is the ``standard error output'';
error messages printed to it will not disappear into an output file.
For example,
a more realistic way to print an error message
when a file can't be opened would be
<pre>
	if((ifp = fopen(filename, "r")) == NULL)
		{
		fprintf(stderr, "can't open file %s\n", filename);
		<I>exit or return</I>
		}
</pre>
where <TT>filename</TT> is a string variable
indicating the file name to be opened.
Not only is the error message printed to <TT>stderr</TT>,
but it is also more informative
in that it mentions the name of the file that couldn't be opened.
(We'll see another example in the next chapter.)
