<H2>11.3 Reallocating Memory Blocks</H2>

<p>Sometimes you're not sure at first how much memory you'll need.
For example,
if you need to store a series of items you read from the user,
and if the only way to know how many there are
is to read them until the user types some ``end'' signal,
you'll have no way of knowing,
as you begin reading and storing the first few,
how many you'll have seen
by the time you do see that ``end'' marker.
You might want to allocate room for, say, 100 items,
and if the user enters a 101st item
before entering the ``end'' marker,
you might wish for a way to say
``uh, <TT>malloc</TT>, remember those 100 items I asked for?
Could I change my mind and have 200 instead?''
</p><p>In fact, you can do exactly this,
with the <TT>realloc</TT> function.
You hand <TT>realloc</TT> an old pointer
(such as you received from an initial call to <TT>malloc</TT>)
and a new size,
and <TT>realloc</TT> does what it can
to give you a chunk of memory big enough
to hold the new size.
For example,
if we wanted the <TT>ip</TT> variable from an earlier example
to point at 200 <TT>ints</TT> instead of 100,
we could try calling
<pre>
	ip = realloc(ip, 200 * sizeof(int));
</pre>
Since you always want each block of dynamically-allocated memory
to be contiguous
(so that you can treat it as if it were an array),
you and <TT>realloc</TT> have to worry about the case
where <TT>realloc</TT> can't make the old block of memory bigger
``in place,''
but rather has to relocate it elsewhere
in order to find enough contiguous space for the new requested size.

<TT>realloc</TT> does this by returning a new pointer.
If <TT>realloc</TT> was able to make the old block of memory bigger,
it returns the same pointer.
If <TT>realloc</TT> has to go elsewhere to get enough contiguous memory,
it returns a pointer to the new memory,
after copying your old data there.
(In this case, after it makes the copy, it frees the old block.)
Finally, if <TT>realloc</TT> can't find enough memory
to satisfy the new request at all,
it returns a null pointer.
Therefore,
you usually don't want to overwrite your old pointer
with <TT>realloc</TT>'s return value
until you've tested it to make sure it's not a null pointer.
You might use code like this:
<pre>
	int *newp;
	newp = realloc(ip, 200 * sizeof(int));
	if(newp != NULL)
		ip = newp;
	else	{
		printf("out of memory\n");
		/* exit or return */
		/* but ip still points at 100 ints */
		}
</pre>
If <TT>realloc</TT> returns something other than a null pointer,
it succeeded, and we set <TT>ip</TT> to what it returned.
(We've either set <TT>ip</TT> to what it used to be or to a new pointer,
but in either case,
it points to where our data is now.)
If <TT>realloc</TT> returns a null pointer, however,
we hang on to our old pointer in <TT>ip</TT>
which still points at our
original
100 values.


</p><p>Putting this all together,
here is a piece of code which reads lines of text from the user,
treats each line as an integer by calling <TT>atoi</TT>,
and stores each integer in a dynamically-allocated ``array'':
<pre>
#define MAXLINE 100

char line[MAXLINE];
int *ip;
int nalloc, nitems;

nalloc = 100;
ip = malloc(nalloc * sizeof(int));		/* initial allocation */
if(ip == NULL)
	{
	printf("out of memory\n");
	exit(1);
	}

nitems = 0;

while(getline(line, MAXLINE) != EOF)
	{
	if(nitems &gt;= nalloc)
		{				/* increase allocation */
		int *newp;
		nalloc += 100;
		newp = realloc(ip, nalloc * sizeof(int));
		if(newp == NULL)
			{
			printf("out of memory\n");
			exit(1);
			}
		ip = newp;
		}

	ip[nitems++] = atoi(line);
	}
</pre>
We use two different variables
to keep track of the ``array'' pointed to by <TT>ip</TT>.
<TT>nalloc</TT> is how many elements we've allocated,
and <TT>nitems</TT> is how many of them are in use.
Whenever we're about to store another item in the ``array,''
if <TT>nitems &gt;= nalloc</TT>,
the old ``array'' is full,
and it's time to call <TT>realloc</TT> to make it bigger.
</p><p>Finally, we might ask what the return type
of <TT>malloc</TT> and <TT>realloc</TT> is,
if they are able to return
pointers to <TT>char</TT> or pointers to <TT>int</TT>
or
(though we haven't seen it yet)
pointers to any other type.
The answer is that both of these functions are declared
(in <TT>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT>)
as returning a type we haven't seen, <TT>void *</TT>
(that is, pointer to <TT>void</TT>).
We haven't really seen type <TT>void</TT>, either,
but what's going on here is that <TT>void *</TT>
is specially defined as a ``generic'' pointer type,
which may be used
(strictly speaking, assigned to or from) any pointer type.
