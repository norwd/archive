<H2>1.2 Second Example</H2>

<p>Our second example is of little more practical use than the first,
but it introduces a few more programming language elements:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* print a few numbers, to illustrate a simple loop */

main()
{
int i;

for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i = i + 1)
	printf("i is %d\n", i);

return 0;
}
</pre>
As before, the line <TT>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> is 
boilerplate

which is
necessary since we're calling the <TT>printf</TT> 
function, and <TT>main()</TT> and the pair of braces 
<TT>{}</TT> indicate and delineate the function named
<TT>main</TT> we're (again) writing.
</p><p>The first new line is the line
<pre>
	/* print a few numbers, to illustrate a simple loop */
</pre>
which is a <dfn>comment</dfn>.
Anything between the characters <TT>/*</TT> and <TT>*/</TT> 
is ignored by the compiler, but may be useful to a person 
trying to read and understand the program.
You can add comments anywhere you want to in the program,
to document what the program is, what it does,
who wrote it,
how it works,
what the various functions are for and how <em>they</em> work,
what the various variables are for,
etc.
</p><p>The second new line, down within the function <TT>main</TT>,
is
<pre>
	int i;
</pre>
which <dfn>declares</dfn> that our function will use a 
variable named <TT>i</TT>.
The variable's type is <TT>int</TT>,
which is a plain integer.
</p><p>Next, we set up a <dfn>loop</dfn>:
<pre>
	for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i = i + 1)
</pre>
The keyword <TT>for</TT> indicates that we are setting up a 
``<TT>for</TT> loop.''
A <TT>for</TT> loop
is controlled by three expressions, enclosed in parentheses and 
separated by semicolons.
These expressions say that,
in this case,
the loop starts by setting <TT>i</TT> to 0,
that it continues as long as <TT>i</TT> is less than 10,
and that after each iteration of the loop,
<TT>i</TT> should be incremented by 1
(that is, have 1 added to its value).
</p><p>Finally, we have a call to the <TT>printf</TT> function,
as before, but with several differences.
First, the call to <TT>printf</TT> is within the <dfn>body</dfn>
of the <TT>for</TT> loop.
This means that control flow does not pass once through the 
<TT>printf</TT> call, but instead that the call is performed 
as many times as are dictated by the <TT>for</TT> loop.
In this case, <TT>printf</TT> will be called several times:
once when <TT>i</TT> is 0,
once when <TT>i</TT> is 1,
once when <TT>i</TT> is 2,
and so on until <TT>i</TT> is 9,
for a total of 10 times.
</p><p>A second difference in the <TT>printf</TT> call is that the 
string to be printed, <TT>"i is %d"</TT>, contains a percent sign.
Whenever <TT>printf</TT> sees a percent sign,
it

indicates
that <TT>printf</TT> is not supposed to print the exact text 
of the string, but is instead supposed to read another one of 
its arguments to decide what to print.
The letter after the percent sign tells it
what type of argument to expect and how to print it.
In this case, the letter <TT>d</TT> indicates that 
<TT>printf</TT> is to expect an <TT>int</TT>, and to print 
it in decimal.
Finally, we see that <TT>printf</TT> is in fact being called 
with another argument, for a total of two, separated by commas.
The second argument is the variable <TT>i</TT>, which is in 
fact an <TT>int</TT>, as required by <TT>%d</TT>.
The effect of all of this is that each time it is called,
<TT>printf</TT> will print
a line containing
the current value of the variable <TT>i</TT>:
<pre>
	i is 0
	i is 1
	i is 2
	...
</pre>
</p><p>After several trips through the loop,
<TT>i</TT> will eventually equal 9.
After that trip through the loop,
the third control expression 
<TT>i = i + 1</TT> will increment its 
value to 10.

The condition <TT>i &lt; 10</TT> is no longer true,
so no more trips through the loop are taken.
Instead, control flow jumps down to the statement following the 
<TT>for</TT> loop, which is the <TT>return</TT> statement.
The <TT>main</TT> function returns, and the program is finished.
