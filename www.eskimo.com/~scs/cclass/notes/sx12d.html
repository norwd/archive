<H2>12.4 Closing Files</H2>

<p>Although you can
open multiple files,

there's a limit to how many you can have open at once.
If your program will open many files in succession,
you'll want to close each one as you're done with it;
otherwise the standard I/O library could run out of
the resources it uses to keep track of open files.
Closing a file simply involves
calling <TT>fclose</TT> with the file pointer as its argument:
<pre>
	fclose(fp);
</pre>
Calling <TT>fclose</TT> arranges that
(if the file was open for output)
any last, buffered output is finally written to the file,
and that those resources used by the operating system
(and the C library)
for this file are released.
If you forget to close a file,
it will be closed automatically when the program exits.
