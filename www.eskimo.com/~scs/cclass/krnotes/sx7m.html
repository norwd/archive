<H2>section 4.11.2: Macro Substitution</H2>

<p><TT>#define</TT>s last for the whole file;
you can't have local ones like you can for local variables.
</p><p>``Substitutions are made only for tokens''
means that a substitutable macro name is only recognized
when it stands alone.
Also,
substitution never happens in quoted strings,
because it turns out that you usually don't want it to.
Strings are generally used for communication with the user,
while you want substitutions to happen where you're talking to the compiler.

</p><p>The point of the ``<TT>forever</TT>'' example
is to demonstrate that the replacement text
doesn't have to be a simple number or string constant.
You'd use the <TT>forever</TT> macro like this:
<pre>	forever {
		...
	}
</pre>which the preprocessor would expand to
<pre>	for (;;) {
		...
	}
</pre>which,
as we learned in section 3.5 on page 60,
is an infinite loop.
(Presumably there's a <TT>break</TT>; see section 3.7 p. 64.)
</p><p>Another popular trick is
<pre>	#define ever ;;
</pre>so that you can say
<pre>	for(ever) {
		...
	}
</pre>But ``preprocessor tricks'' like these
tend to get out of hand very quickly;
if you use too many of them
you're not writing in C any more
but rather in your own peculiar dialect,
and no one will be able to read your code
without understanding all of your ``silly little macros.''
It <em>is</em> best if simple macros expand to simple constants 
(or expressions).
</p><p>Macros with arguments are also called ``function-like macros''
because they act almost like miniature functions.
There are some important differences, however:
<UL><li>no call-by-value copying semantics

<li>no space saving
<li>hard to have local variables or block structure
<li>have to parenthesize carefully
(see below)
</UL></p><p>page 90
</p><p>The correct way to write the <TT>square()</TT> macro is
<pre>	#define square(x) ((x) * (x))
</pre>There are three rules to remember when defining
function-like macros:
</p><OL><li>The macro expansion must always be parenthesized
so that any low-precedence operators it contains
will still be evaluated first.

If we didn't write the <TT>square()</TT> macro carefully,
the invocation
<pre>	1 / square(n)
</pre>might expand to
<pre>	1 / n * n
</pre>while it should expand to
<pre>	1 / (n * n)
</pre><li>Within the macro definition,
all
occurrences
of the parameters
must be parenthesized
so that any low-precedence operators
the actual arguments contain
will be evaluated first.

If we didn't write the <TT>square()</TT> macro carefully,
the invocation
<pre>	square(n + 1)
</pre>might expand to
<pre>	n + 1 * n + 1
</pre>while it should expand to
<pre>	(n + 1) * (n + 1)
</pre><li>If a parameter appears several times
in the expansion,
the macro may not work properly
if the actual argument
is an expression with
side effects.
No matter how we parenthesize the <TT>square()</TT> macro,
the invocation
<pre>	square(i++)
</pre>would result in
<pre>	i++ * i++
</pre>(perhaps with some parentheses),
but this expression is undefined,
because we don't know when the two increments
will happen with respect to each other or the multiplication.
</OL>Since the <TT>square()</TT> macro can't be written perfectly safely,
(arguments with side effects will always be troublesome),
its callers will always have to be careful
(i.e. not to call it with arguments with side effects).
One convention is to capitalize the names of macros
which can't be treated <em>exactly</em> as if they were functions:
<pre>	#define Square(x) ((x) * (x))
</pre><p>page 90 continued
</p><p><TT>#undef</TT> can be used when you want to give a macro 
restricted scope,
if you can remember to undefine it when you want it to go out of scope.
Don't worry about
``[ensuring] that a routine is really a function, not a macro''
or the <TT>getchar</TT> example.
</p><p>Also, don't worry about the <TT>#</TT> and <TT>##</TT> operators.
These are new ANSI features
which aren't needed except in relatively special circumstances.
