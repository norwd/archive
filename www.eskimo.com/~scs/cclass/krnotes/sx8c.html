<H2>section 5.3: Pointers and Arrays</H2>

page 97
<p>For some people,
section 5.3 is evidently the hardest section in this book,
or even if they haven't read this book,
the most confusing aspect of the language.
C introduces a novel and,
it can be said,
elegant integration of pointers and arrays,
but there are a distressing number of ways of misunderstanding arrays,
or pointers, or both.
Take this section very slowly,
learn the things it does say,
and <em>don't</em> learn anything it doesn't say
(i.e. don't make any false assumptions).
</p><p>It's not necessarily true that
``the pointer version will in general be faster'';
efficiency is
(or ought to be)
a secondary concern when considering the use of pointers.
</p><p>page 98
</p><p>On the top half of this page,
we aren't seeing anything we haven't seen before.
We already knew
(or should have known)
that the declaration
<TT>int a[10];</TT>
declares an array of ten contiguous <TT>int</TT>'s
numbered from 0 to 9.
We saw on page 94 and again on page 96
that <TT>&amp;</TT> can be used to take the address of one cell of an array.
</p><p>What's new on this page are first the nice pictures
(and they <em>are</em> nice pictures;
I think they're the right way of thinking about arrays and pointers in C)
and the definition of pointer arithmetic.
If the phrase
``then by definition <TT>pa+1</TT> points to the next element''
alarms you;
if you hadn't known that <TT>pa+1</TT> points to the next element;
don't worry.
You hadn't
known this,
and you aren't expected even to have suspected it:
the reason that <TT>pa+1</TT> points to the next element
is simply that it's defined that way,
as the sentence says.
Furthermore,
subtraction works in an exactly analogous way:
If we were to say
<pre>	pa = &amp;a[5];
</pre>then <TT>*(pa-1)</TT> would refer to the contents of <TT>a[4]</TT>,
and <TT>*(pa-i)</TT> would refer to the contents of the location 
<TT>i</TT> elements before cell 5
(as long as <TT>i</TT> <= 5).
</p><p>Note furthermore that we do <em>not</em> have to worry
about the size of the objects pointed to.
Adding 1 to a pointer
(or subtracting 1)
always means to move over one object of the type pointed to,
to get to the next element.
(If you're too worried about machine addresses,
or the actual address values stored in pointers,
or the actual sizes of things,
it's easy to mistakenly assume that adding or subtracting 1 
adds or subtracts 1 from the machine address,
but as we mentioned,
you don't have to think at this low level.
We'll see in section 5.4 how pointer arithmetic is actually 
scaled,
automatically,
by the size of the object pointed to,
but we don't have to worry about it if we don't want to.)
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>The meaning of ``adding 1 to a pointer,''
and by extension,
all pointer arithmetic,
is that <TT>pa+1</TT> points to the next object,
and <TT>pa+i</TT> points to the <TT>i</TT>-th object beyond <TT>pa</TT>.
</blockquote></p><p>This aspect of pointers--that arithmetic works on them,
and in this way--is one of
several vital facts about pointers in C.
On the next page, we'll see the others.
</p><p>page 99
</p><p>Deep sentences:
<blockquote>The correspondence between indexing and pointer arithmetic is very close.
By definition,
the value of a variable or expression of type array
is the address of element zero of the array.
</blockquote>This is a fundamental definition,
which we'll now spend several pages discussing.
</p><p>Don't worry too much yet about the assertion that
``<TT>pa</TT> and <TT>a</TT> have identical values.''
We're not surprised about the value of <TT>pa</TT> after the assignment
<TT>pa = &amp;a[0];</TT>
we've been taking the address of array elements for several pages now.
What we don't
know--we're
not yet in a position to be surprised about it or
not--is
what the ``value'' of the array <TT>a</TT> is.
What <em>is</em> the value of the array <TT>a</TT>?
</p><p>In some languages,
the value of an array is the entire array.
If an array appears on the right-hand sign of an assignment,
the entire array is assigned,
and the left-hand side had better be an array, too.
C does not work this way;
C never lets you manipulate entire arrays.
</p><p>In C,
by definition,
the value of an array,
when it appears in an expression,
is a pointer to its first element.
In other words,
the value of the array <TT>a</TT> simply <em>is</em> <TT>&amp;a[0]</TT>.
If this statement makes any kind of intuitive sense to you at 
this point,
that's great,
but if it doesn't,
please just take it on faith for a while.
This statement is a fundamental
(in fact <em>the</em> fundamental)
definition about arrays and pointers in C,
and if you don't remember it,
or don't believe it,
then
pointers and arrays will never make proper sense.
(You will also need to know another bit of jargon:
we often say that,
when
an array appears
in an expression,
it <dfn>decays</dfn> into a pointer to its first element.)
</p><p>Given the above definition,
let's explore some of the consequences.
First of all,
though we've been saying
<pre>	pa = &amp;a[0];
</pre>we could also say
<pre>	pa = a;
</pre>because by definition the value of <TT>a</TT> in an expression
(i.e. as it sits there all alone on the right-hand side)
is <TT>&amp;a[0]</TT>.
Secondly,
anywhere we've been using square brackets <TT>[]</TT> to subscript an array,
we could also have used the pointer dereferencing operator <TT>*</TT>.
That is, instead of writing
<pre>	i = a[5];
</pre>we could,
if we wanted to,
instead write
<pre>	i = *(a+5);
</pre>Why would this possibly work?
How could this possibly work?
Let's look at the expression <TT>*(a+5)</TT> step by step.
It contains a reference to the array <TT>a</TT>,
which is by definition a pointer to its first element.
So <TT>*(a+5)</TT> is equivalent to <TT>*(&amp;a[0]+5)</TT>.
To make things clear,
let's pretend that we'd assigned the pointer to the first element
to an actual pointer variable:
<pre>	int *pa = &amp;a[0];
</pre>Now
we have
<TT>*(a+5)</TT> is equivalent to
<TT>*(&amp;a[0]+5)</TT> is equivalent to <TT>*(pa+5)</TT>.
But we learned on page 98 that <TT>*(pa+5)</TT> is simply the 
contents of the location 5 cells past where <TT>pa</TT> points to.
Since <TT>pa</TT> points to <TT>a[0]</TT>,
<TT>*(pa+5)</TT> is <TT>a[5]</TT>.
Thus,
for whatever it's worth,
any time you have an array subscript <TT>a[i]</TT>,
you could write it as <TT>*(a+i)</TT>.
</p><p>The idea of the previous paragraph isn't worth much,
because if you've got an array <TT>a</TT>,
indexing it using the notation <TT>a[i]</TT>
is considerably more natural and convenient than the alternate <TT>*(a+i)</TT>.
The significant fact is that this little correspondence between 
the expressions <TT>a[i]</TT> and <TT>*(a+i)</TT>
holds for more than just arrays.
If <TT>pa</TT> is a pointer,
we can get at locations near it by using <TT>*(pa+i)</TT>,
as we learned on page 98,
but we can <em>also</em> use <TT>pa[i]</TT>.
This time, using the ``other'' notation
(array instead of pointer,
when we thought we had a pointer)
can be more convenient.
</p><p>At this point,
you may be asking <em>why</em> you can write <TT>pa[i]</TT>
instead of <TT>*(pa+i)</TT>.
You may be wondering how you're going to remember that you can do this,
or remember what it means if you see it in someone else's code,
when it's such a surprising fact in the first place.
There are several ways to remember it;
pick whichever one suits you:
<OL><li>It's an arbitrary fact,
true by definition;
just memorize it.
<li>If,
for an array <TT>a</TT>,
instead of writing <TT>a[i]</TT>,
you can also write <TT>*(a+i)</TT>
(as we proved a few paragraphs back);
then it's only fair that for a pointer <TT>pa</TT>,
instead of writing <TT>*(pa+i)</TT>,
you can also write <TT>pa[i]</TT>.
<li>Deep sentence:
``In evaluating <TT>a[i]</TT>,
C converts it to <TT>*(a+i)</TT> immediately;
the two forms are equivalent.''
<li>An array is
a contiguous block of elements of a particular type.
A pointer often points to
a contiguous block of elements of a particular type.
Therefore, it's very handy to treat
a pointer to a contiguous block of elements
<em>as if</em>
it were an array,
by saying things like <TT>pa[i]</TT>.
 <li>
[This is the most radical explanation,
though it's also the most true;
but if it offends your sensibilities
or only seems to make things more confusing,
please ignore it.]
When you said <TT>a[i]</TT>,
you weren't really subscripting an array at all,
because an array like <TT>a</TT> in an expression always turns 
into a pointer to its first element.
So the array subscripting operator <TT>[]</TT> <em>always</em> 
finds itself working on pointers,
and it's a simple identity
(another definition)
that <TT>pa[i]</TT> is <TT>*(pa+i)</TT>.
</OL>(But do pick at least one reason to remember this fact,
as it's a fact you'll need to remember;
expressions like <TT>pa[i]</TT> are quite common.)
</p><p>The authors point out that
``There is one difference between an array name and a pointer 
that must be kept in mind,''
and this is quite true,
but note very carefully that there is
in fact
<em>every</em> difference 
between an array and a pointer.
When an array name appears in most expressions,
it turns into a pointer
(to the array's first element),
but that does <em>not</em> mean that the array <em>is</em> a pointer.
You may hear it stated that ``an array is just a constant pointer,''
and this is a convenient explanation,
but it is a simplified and potentially misleading explanation.
</p><p>With that said,
do make sure you understand why <TT>a=pa</TT> and <TT>a++</TT>
(where <TT>a</TT> is an array)
cannot mean anything.
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>When an array name is passed to a function,
what is passed is the location of the initial element.
</blockquote>Though perhaps surprising,
this sentence doesn't say anything new.
A function call,
and more importantly,
each of its arguments,
is an expression,
and in an expression,
a reference to an array is always replaced by a pointer to its first element.
So given
<pre>	int a[10];
	f(a);
</pre>it is not the entire array <TT>a</TT> that is passed to <TT>f</TT>
but rather just a pointer to its first element.
For an example closer to the text on page 99,
given
<pre>	char string[] = "Hello, world!";
	int len = strlen(string);
</pre>it is not the entire array <TT>string</TT> that is passed to <TT>strlen</TT>
(recall that C never lets you do anything with
a string or
an array all at once),
but rather just a pointer to its first element.
</p><p>We now realize that we've been operating under a gentle fiction
during the first four chapters of the book.
Whenever we wrote a function like <TT>getline</TT> or <TT>getop</TT>
which seemed to accept an array of characters,
and whenever we thought we were passing arrays of characters to these routines,
we were actually passing pointers.
This explains,
among other things,
how <TT>getline</TT> and <TT>getop</TT> were able to modify 
the arrays in the caller,
even though we said that call-by-value meant that functions 
can't modify variables in their callers since they receive 
copies of the parameters.
When a function receives a pointer,
it cannot modify the original pointer in the caller,

but it can definitely modify what the pointer points <em>to</em>.
</p><p>If that doesn't make sense,
make sure you appreciate the full difference
between a pointer and what it points to!
It is intirely possible to modify one without modifying the other.
Let's illustrate this with an example.
If we say
<pre>	char a[] = "hello";
	char b[] = "world";
</pre>we've declared two character arrays,
<TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT>,
each containing a string.
If we say
<pre>	char *p = a;
</pre>we've declared <TT>p</TT> as a pointer-to-<TT>char</TT>,
and initialized it to point to the first character of the array <TT>a</TT>.
If we then say
<pre>	*p = 'H';
</pre>we've modified what <TT>p</TT> points to.
We have not modified <TT>p</TT> itself.
After saying <TT>*p = 'H';</TT>
the string in the array <TT>a</TT>
has been modified to contain <TT>"Hello"</TT>.
</p><p>If we say
<pre>	p = b;
</pre>on the other hand,
we have modified the pointer <TT>p</TT> itself.
We have not really modified what <TT>p</TT> points to.
In a sense,
``what <TT>p</TT> points to''
has changed--it
used to be the string in the array <TT>a</TT>,
and now it's the string in the array <TT>b</TT>.
But saying <TT>p = b</TT> didn't modify either of the strings.
</p><p>page 100
</p><p>Since,
as we've just seen,
functions never receive arrays as parameters,
but instead always receive pointers,
how have we been able to get away with defining functions
(like <TT>getline</TT> and <TT>getop</TT>)
which seemed to accept arrays?
The answer is that whenever you declare an array parameter to a function,
the compiler pretends that you actually declared a pointer.
(It does this mostly so that
we can get away with the ``gentle fiction''
of pretending that we can pass arrays to functions.)
</p><p>When you see a statement like
``<TT>char s[];</TT> and <TT>char *s</TT>; are equivalent''
(as in fact you see at the top of page 100),
you can be sure that
(and you must remember that)
it is <em>only</em> function formal parameters that are being 
talked about.
Anywhere else,
arrays and pointers are quite different,
as we've discussed.
</p><p>Expressions like <TT>p[-1]</TT>
(at the end of section 5.3)
may be easier to understand
if we convert them back to the pointer form <TT>*(p + -1)</TT>
and thence to <TT>*(p-1)</TT>
which,
as we've seen,
is the object one before what <TT>p</TT> points to.
</p><p>With the examples in this section,
we begin to see how pointer manipulations can go awry.
In sections 5.1 and 5.2,
most of our pointers were to simple variables.
When we use pointers into arrays,
and when we begin using pointer arithmetic
to access nearby cells of the array,
we must be careful never to go off the end of the array,
in either direction.
A pointer is only valid if it points to one of the allocated 
cells of an array.
(There is also an exception for a pointer just past the end of an array,
which we'll talk about later.)
Given the declarations
<pre>	int a[10];
	int *pa;
</pre>the statements
<pre>	pa = a;
	*pa = 0;
	*(pa+1) = 1;
	pa[2] = 2;
	pa = &amp;a[5];
	*pa = 5;
	*(pa-1) = 4;
	pa[1] = 6;
	pa = &amp;a[9];
	*pa = 9;
	pa[-1] = 8;
</pre>are all valid.
These statements set the pointer <TT>pa</TT>
pointing to various cells of the array <TT>a</TT>,
and modify some of those cells
by <dfn>indirecting on</dfn> the pointer <TT>pa</TT>.
(As an exercise,
verify that each cell of <TT>a</TT> that receives a value
receives the value of its own index.
For example, <TT>a[6]</TT> is set to 6.)
</p><p>However,
the statements
<pre>	pa = a;
	*(pa+10) = 0;	/* WRONG */
	*(pa-1) = 0;	/* WRONG */
	pa = &amp;a[5];
	*(pa+10) = 0;	/* WRONG */
	pa = &amp;a[10];
	*pa = 0;	/* WRONG */
</pre>and
<pre>	int *pa2;
	pa = &amp;a[5];
	pa2 = pa + 10;	/* WRONG */
	pa2 = pa - 10;	/* WRONG */
</pre>are all invalid.
The first examples set <TT>pa</TT> to point into the array <TT>a</TT>
but then use overly-large offsets
(+10, -1)
which end up trying to store a value outside of the array <TT>a</TT>.
The statements in the last set of examples
set <TT>pa2</TT> to point outside of the array <TT>a</TT>.
Even though no attempt is made to access the nonexistent cells,
these statements are illegal, too.
Finally,
the code
<pre>	int a[10];
	int *pa, *pa2;
	pa = &amp;a[5];
	pa2 = pa + 10;	/* WRONG */
	*pa2 = 0;	/* WRONG */
</pre>would be very wrong,
because it not only computes a pointer to the nonexistent
15<sup>th<sup> cell of a 10-element array,
but it also tries to store something there.
