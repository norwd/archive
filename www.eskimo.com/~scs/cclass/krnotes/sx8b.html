<H2>section 5.2: Pointers and Function Arguments</H2>

page 95
<p>This section discusses a very common use of pointers:
setting things up so that a function can modify values in its caller,
or return values,
via its arguments.
Remember that,
normally,
C passes arguments by value,
and that if a function modifies one of its arguments,
it modifies only its local copy,
not the value in the caller.
(Normally,
this is a good thing;
having a function which inadvertently assigns to its arguments
and hence inadvertently modifies a value in its caller

can be a source of obscure bugs in languages which don't use call-by-value.)
However,
what happens if a function wants to modify a value in its caller,
and its caller wants to let it?
How can a function return two values?
(A function's formal return value is always a single value.)
</p><p>The answer to both questions
is that a function can declare a parameter which is a pointer.
The caller then passes a pointer to
(that is, the ``address of'')
a variable in the caller which is to be modified
or which is to receive the second return value.
In fact,
we've seen examples of this already:
<TT>getline</TT> returns the length of the line it reads
as well as the line itself,
and
the <TT>getop</TT> routine in the calculator example
in section 4.3
returned both a code for an operator
and a string representing the full text of the operator.
(We needed
that string
when the operator was <TT>'0'</TT> indicating numeric input,
so that the string could return
the full numeric input.)
Though we didn't say so at the time,
we were actually using pointers
in these examples.
(We'll explore the relationship between arrays and pointers,
which made this possible,
in section 5.3.)
</p><p>With all of this in mind,
make sure that you understand why the swap example on page 95 
would not work,
and how and why the swap example on page 96 <em>does</em> work,
and what the figure on page 96 shows.
</p><p>The <TT>swap</TT> example demonstrated a function
which modified some variables
(<TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT>)
in its caller.
The <TT>getint</TT> example demonstrates
how to return two values from a function
by returning one value as the normal function return value
and the other one by writing to a pointer.
(There
is no fundamental difference,
though,
between
``modifying a variable in the caller''
and
``returning a value by writing to a pointer'';
these are just two applications of pointer parameters.)
</p><p>The version of <TT>getint</TT> on page 97
is somewhat complicated because it
allows free-form input,
that is,
the values need only be separated by whitespace or punctuation;
they are not restricted to being one per line or anything.
(C source code is also free-form in this regard;
see page 4 of chapter 1 of these notes.)
To see more clearly
the essence of what <TT>getint</TT> is supposed to do,
imagine for a moment that
the input <em>is</em> restricted to one value per line,
as in the ``primitive calculator'' example on page 72 of section 4.2.
In that case,
we might use the following simpler
(i.e. more primitive)
code:
<pre>	int getint(int *pn)
	{
		char line[20];
		if (getline(line, 20) &lt;= 0)
			return EOF;
		*pn = atoi(line);
		return 1;
	}
</pre>The <TT>getint</TT> function on page 97 is 
documented as returning nonzero for a valid number and 0 for 
something other than a number.
Our stripped-down version does not,
and as it happens,
the example code at the bottom of page 96 does not make use of 
the valid/invalid distinction.
Can you see a way to rewrite the code at the bottom of page 96
to fill in the cells of the <TT>array</TT> with only valid numbers?
</p><p>You might also notice,
again from the code at the bottom of page 96,
that <TT>&amp;</TT> need not be restricted to single, simple variables;
it can take the address of any data object,
in this case,
one cell of the <TT>array</TT>.
Just as for all of C's other operators,
<TT>&amp;</TT> can be applied to arbitrary expressions,
although it is restricted to expressions which represent 
addressable objects.
Expressions like
<TT>&amp;1</TT> or <TT>&amp;(2+3)</TT>
are meaningless and illegal.
</p><p>You may remember a discussion from section 1.5.1 on page 16
of how C's <TT>getchar</TT> routine is able to return all possible characters,
plus an end-of-file indication,
in its single return value.
Why does <TT>getint</TT> need two return values?
Why can't it use the same trick that <TT>getchar</TT> does?
</p><p>The examples in this section are again relatively safe.
The pointers have all been parameters,
and the callers have passed pointers
(that is, the ``addresses'' of)
their own, properly-allocated variables.
That is,
code like
<pre>	int a = 1, b = 2;
	swap(&amp;a, &amp;b);
</pre>and
<pre>	int a;
	getint(&amp;a);
</pre>is correct and quite safe.
</p><p>Something to beware of,
though,
is the temptation to inadvertently pass an uninitialized pointer variable
(rather than the ``address'' of some other
variable)
to a routine which expects a pointer.
We know that the <TT>getint</TT> routine expects
as its argument
a pointer to an <TT>int</TT> in which it is to store the integer it gets.
Suppose we took that description literally,
and wrote
<pre>	int *ip;	/* a pointer to an int */
	getint(ip);
</pre>Here we have in fact passed a pointer-to-<TT>int</TT> to <TT>getint</TT>,
but the pointer we passed doesn't point anywhere!
When <TT>getint</TT> writes to (``dereferences'')
the pointer, in an expression like <TT>*pn = 0</TT>,
it will scribble on some random part of memory,
and the program may crash.
When people get caught in this trap,
they often think that to fix it they need to use the <TT>&amp;</TT> operator:
<pre>	getint(&amp;ip);	/* WRONG */
</pre>or maybe the <TT>*</TT> operator:
<pre>	getint(*ip);	/* WRONG */
</pre>but these go from bad to worse.
(If you think about them carefully,
<TT>&amp;ip</TT> is a pointer-to-pointer-to-<TT>int</TT>,
and <TT>*ip</TT> is an <TT>int</TT>,
and neither of these types matches the pointer-to-<TT>int</TT>
which <TT>getint</TT> expects.)
The correct usage for now,
as we showed already,
is something like
<pre>	int a;
	getint(&amp;a);
</pre>In this case,
<TT>a</TT> is an honest-to-goodness, allocated <TT>int</TT>,
so when we generate a pointer to it
(with <TT>&amp;a</TT>)
and call <TT>getint</TT>,
<TT>getint</TT> receives a pointer that does point somewhere.
