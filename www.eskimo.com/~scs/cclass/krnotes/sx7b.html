<H2>section 4.2: Functions Returning Non-Integers</H2>

page 71
<p>Actually,
we
may
have
seen at least one function returning a non-integer,
in
the Fahrenheit-Celsius conversion program
in exercise 1-15
on page 27
in section 1.7.
</p><p>The type name which precedes the name of a function
(and which sets its return type)
looks just like
(i.e. is syntactically the same as)
the <TT>void</TT> keyword we've been using
to identify functions which don't return a value.
</p><p>Note that the version of <TT>atof</TT> on page 71 does not 
handle exponential notation like <TT>1.23e45</TT>;
handling exponents is left for exercise 4-2 on page 73.
<br><br></p><p>``The standard library includes an <TT>atof</TT>''
means that we're reimplementing something
which would otherwise be provided for us anyway
(i.e. just like <TT>printf</TT>).
In general,
it's a bad idea to rewrite standard library routines,
because by doing so you negate the advantage of having 
someone else write them for you,
and
also
because the compiler or linker are allowed to complain
if you redefine a standard routine.
(On the other hand,
seeing how the standard library routines are implemented
can be a good learning experience.)
</p><p>page 72
</p><p>In the ``primitive calculator'' code at the top of page 72,
note that the call to <TT>atof</TT>
is buried in the argument list of the call to <TT>printf</TT>. 
</p><p>Deep sentences:
<blockquote>The function <TT>atof</TT> must be declared and defined consistently.
If <TT>atof</TT> itself
and the call to it in <TT>main</TT>
have inconsistent types in the same source file,
the error will be detected by the compiler.
But if
(as is more likely)
<TT>atof</TT> were compiled separately,
the mismatch would not be detected,
<TT>atof</TT> would return a <TT>double</TT>
that <TT>main</TT> would treat as an <TT>int</TT>,
and meaningless answers would result.
</blockquote>The problems of mismatched function declarations are somewhat 
reduced today by the widespread use of ANSI function prototypes,
but they're still important to be aware of.
</p><p>The implicit function declarations mentioned at the bottom of 
page 72 are an older feature of the language.
They were handy back in the days when most functions returned 
<TT>int</TT> and function prototypes hadn't been invented yet,
but today,
if you want to use prototypes,
you won't want to rely on implicit declarations.
If you don't like depending on defaults and implicit declarations,
or if you do want to use function prototypes religiously,
you're under no compunction to make use of
(or even learn about)
implicit function declarations,
and you'll want to configure your compiler
so that it will warn you
if you call a function which does not have an explicit,
prototyped declaration in scope.
</p><p>You may wonder why the compiler is able to get some things right
(such as implicit conversions
between integers and floating-point
within expressions)
whether or not you're explicit about your intentions,
while in other circumstances
(such as while calling functions returning non-integers)
you must be explicit.
The question of when to be explicit and when to rely on the compiler
hinges on several questions:
<OL><li>How much information does the compiler have available to it?
<li>How likely is it that the compiler will infer the right action?
<li>How likely is it that a mistake
which you the programmer might make
will be caught by the compiler,
or silently compiled into incorrect code?
</OL></p><p>It's fine to depend on things like implicit conversions
as long as the compiler has all the information it needs
to get them right, unambiguously.
(Relying on implicit conversions
can make code cleaner, clearer,
and easier to maintain.)
Relying on implicit declarations,
however,
is discouraged,
for several reasons.
First,
there are generally fewer declarations than expressions in a program,
so the impact
(i.e. work)
of making them all explicit is less.
Second,
thinking about declarations is good discipline,
and
requiring
that everything normally be declared explicitly
can let the compiler catch a number of errors for you
(such as misspelled functions or variables).
Finally,
since the compiler only compiles one source file at a time,
it is never able to detect inconsistencies between files
(such as a function or variable declared one way in once source 
file and some other way in another),
so it's important that cross-file declarations be explicit and 
consistent.
(Various strategies,
such as
placing common declarations in header files
so that they can be #included wherever they're needed,
and
requesting that the compiler warn about function calls 
without prototypes in scope,
can help to reduce the number of errors having to do with 
improper declarations.)

</p><p>For the most part,
you can also ignore the ``old style'' function syntax,
which hardly anyone is using any more.
The only thing to watch out for is that an empty set of 
parentheses in a function declaration
is an old-style declaration and means ``unspecified 
arguments,'' not ``no arguments.''
To declare a new-style function taking no arguments,
you must include the keyword <TT>void</TT> between the parentheses,
which makes the lack of arguments explicit.
(A declaration like
<pre>	int f(void);
</pre>does <em>not</em> declare a function accepting one argument of type <TT>void</TT>,
which would be meaningless,
since
the definition of type <TT>void</TT> is that it is a type with no values.
Instead,
as a special case,
a single, unnamed parameter of type <TT>void</TT> indicates
that a function takes no arguments.)
For example,
the definition of the <TT>getchar</TT> function might look
like
<pre>	int getchar(void)
	{
		int c;
<br>
<br>
		<I>read next character into</I> c <I>somehow</I>
<br>
<br>
		if (<I>no next character</I>)
			return EOF;
<br>
<br>
		return c;
	}
</pre></p><p>page 73
</p><p>Note that this version of <TT>atoi</TT>,
written in terms of <TT>atof</TT>,
has very slightly different behavior:
it reads past a '.'
(and, assuming a fully-functional version of <TT>atof</TT>, an 'e').
<br>
</p><p>The use of an explicit cast
when returning a floating-point expression
from a routine declared as returning <TT>int</TT>
represents another point on the spectrum
of what you should worry about explicitly
versus what you should feel comfortable making use of implicitly.
This is a case where the compiler <em>can</em>
do the ``right thing'' safely and unambiguously,
as long as what you <em>said</em>
(in this case, to return a floating-point expression
from a routine declared as returning <TT>int</TT>)
is in fact what you <em>meant</em>.
But since the real possibility exists
that discarding the fractional part
is not what you meant,
some compilers will warn you about it.
Typically,
compilers which warn about such things can be quieted by using 
an explicit cast;
the explicit cast
(even though it appears to ask for the same conversion that 
would have happened implicitly)
serves to silence the warning.
(In general,
it's best to silence spurious warnings rather than just ignoring them.
If you get in the habit of ignoring them,
sooner or later you'll overlook a significant one
that you would have cared about.)
