<H2>section 1.8: Arguments -- Call by Value</H2>

page 27
<p>If,
on the other hand,
you are <em>not</em> used to other languages such as Fortran,
these call-by-value semantics may not be surprising
(any more than anything else in C which is new to you).
</p><p>Even though you <em>can</em> modify a parameter in a function
(i.e. treat it as a ``conveniently initialized local variable''),
you certainly don't have to,
especially if
(as is often the case)
you'll need an unmodified copy of the parameter later in the function.
</p><p>page 28
</p><p>Don't worry too much about the exception mentioned for 
arrays--there
are a number of exceptions for arrays, and we'll have much more
to say about them later.
But be aware that we are deliberately glossing over a few details here,
and they are details which will become important later on.
(In particular, the statement on page 27 that ``the called 
function cannot directly alter a variable in the calling 
function'' may not seem to be true for arrays, and this is 
what the authors mean when they say that ``The story is 
different''.
We'll be seeing several functions which return 
things--usually strings--to
their callers by writing into caller-supplied arrays.
In chapter 5 we'll learn how this is possible.
If this discrepancy wouldn't have bothered you now,
pretend I didn't mention it.)
