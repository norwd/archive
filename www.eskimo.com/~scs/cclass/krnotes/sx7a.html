<H2>section 4.1: Basics of Functions</H2>

page 68
<p>Once again,
notice how a clear, simple description of the problem we're trying to solve
leads to an
(almost)
equally clear program implementing it.
</p><p>Here are some more nice statements about
the virtues of a clean, modular design:
<blockquote>Although it's certainly possible
to put the code for all of this in <TT>main</TT>,
a better way is to use the structure to advantage
by making each part a separate function.
Three small pieces are easier to deal with than one big one,
because irrelevant details can be buried in the functions,
and the chance of unwanted interactions is minimized.
And the pieces may even be useful in other programs.
</blockquote></p><p>Let's say a bit more about how and why functions can be useful.
First,
we can see that,
having chosen to use a separate function
for each part of the print-matching-lines program,
the top-level <TT>main</TT> routine on page 69
is particularly simple and straightforward;
it's little more than a transcription into C
of the pseudocode on page 68.
The authors don't tend to use too many comments in their code, anyway,
but this code hardly needs any:
the names of the functions called speak for themselves.
(The only thing that might not be obvious at first is that 
<TT>strindex</TT> is being used not so much to find the index 
of a substring but just to determine whether a substring is 
present at all.)
Second,
we may be pleased to notice
that we're already having a chance
to re-use the <TT>getline</TT> function
we first wrote in Chapter 1.
Third,
we note that the two functions which we've chosen to use
(<TT>getline</TT> and <TT>strindex</TT>)
are themselves reasonably simple and straightforward to write.
Finally,
note that sometimes what you re-use is not so much a function 
as a function <I>interface</I>.
The code on page 69 uses a new implementation of 
<TT>getline</TT>,
but the interface
(the argument list,
return value,
and functionality)
is the same as for the versions of <TT>getline</TT> in section 
1.9 on page 29.
We could have used that version here,
or this new version there.
Later,
if we think of some even better way of reading lines,
we can write yet another version of <TT>getline</TT>,
and as long as it has the same interface,
these programs can call it without
their
having to be rewritten.
</p><p>The ease with which a program like this comes together may be mildly deceptive,
because nowhere have we discussed the motivations
which led to the particular pseudocode description on page 68
or the particular definitions of the functions which were chosen
to break the problem down into.
Choosing a design for a program,
and defining subfunctions
(their interfaces and their behavior)
are both arts,
and of course the tasks are not unrelated.
A good design leads to the invention of functions
which might well be useful later,
and an existing body of good, general-purpose functions
(all crying out to be re-used)
can help to guide the design of the next program.
</p><p>What makes a good building block,
either an abstract one that we use in a pseudocode description,
or a concrete one in the form of a general-purpose function?
The most important aspect of a good building block
is that it have a single, well-defined task to perform.
Two of the three functions
used in the line-matching program
fill this role very well:
<TT>getline</TT>'s job is to <I>read one line</I>,
and
<TT>strindex</TT>'s job is to <I>find one string in another string</I>.
<TT>printf</TT>'s specification is considerably broader:
its job is to <I>print stuff</I>.
(It's not surprising that <TT>printf</TT> can therefore be the 
harder routine to call,
and is certainly much harder to implement.
Its saving virtue is that it is nonetheless broadly applicable 
and infinitely reusable.)
</p><p>When you find that a program is hard to manage,
it's often because it has not been designed
and broken up into functions cleanly.
Two obvious reasons for moving code down into a function are
because:
</p><p>1.
It appeared in the main program several times,
such that by making it a function,
it can be written just once,
and the several places where it used to appear
can be
replaced with calls to the new function.
<p>2.
The main program was getting too big,
so it could be made (presumably) smaller and more manageable by 
lopping part of it off and making it a function.
<p>These two reasons are important,
and they represent significant benefits of well-chosen functions,
but they are not sufficient to automatically identify
a good function.
A good function has at least these two additional attributes:
</p><p>3.
It does just one well-defined task, and does it well.
<p>4.
Its interface to the rest of the program is clean and narrow.
<p>Attribute 3 is just a restatement of something we said above.
Attribute 4 says that you shouldn't have to keep track of too many things
when calling a function.
If you know what a function is supposed to do,
and if its task is simple and well-defined,
there should be just a few pieces of information
you have to give it to act upon,
and one or just a few pieces of information
which
it returns to you when it's done.
If you find yourself having to pass lots and lots of 
information to a function,
or remember details of its internal implementation to make sure 
that it will work properly this time,
it's often a sign that the function is not sufficiently well-defined.
(It may be an arbitrary chunk of code that was ripped out of a 
main program
that was getting too big,
such that it essentially has to have access to
all of that main function's variables.)
</p><p>The whole point of breaking a program up into functions
is so that you don't have to think about the entire program at once;
ideally, you can think about just one function at a time.
A good function is a ``black box'':
when you call it, you only have to know what it does
(not how it does it);
and when you're writing it,
you only have to know what it's supposed to do
(and you don't have to know why or under what circumstances
its caller will be calling it).
Some functions may be hard to write
(if they have a hard job to do,
or if it's hard to make them do it truly well),
but that difficulty should be compartmentalized along with the 
function itself.
Once you've written a ``hard'' function,
you should be able to sit back and relax
and watch it do that hard work on call from the rest of your program.
If you find that difficulties pervade a program,
that the hard parts can't be buried inside black-box functions
and then forgotten about,
if you find that there are hard parts which involve complicated 
interactions among multiple functions,
then the program probably needs redesigning.
</p><p>For the purposes of explanation,
we've been seeming to talk so far only about ``main programs'' 
and the functions they call and the rationale behind moving 
some piece of code down out of a ``main program'' into a function.
But in reality,
there's obviously no need to restrict ourselves to a two-tier 
scheme.
The ``main program,'' <TT>main()</TT>,
is itself just a function,
and any function we find ourself writing
will often be appropriately written
in terms of sub-functions, sub-sub-functions, etc.
</p><p>That's probably enough
for now
about functions in general.
Here are a few more notes about the line-matching program.
</p><p>The authors mention that
``The standard library provides a function <TT>strstr</TT>
that is similar to <TT>strindex</TT>,
except that it returns a pointer instead of an index.''
We haven't met pointers yet
(they're in chapter 5),
so we aren't quite in a position to appreciate the difference 
between an index and a pointer.
Generally,
an index is a small number referring to some element of an array.
A pointer is more general:
it can point to any data object of a particular type, whether 
it's one element of an array,
or some other object anywhere in memory.
(Don't worry too much about the distinction yet,
but bear in mind that there is a distinction.
Note, too, that the distinction is not absolute;
in fact,
the word ``index'' seems to derive from the concept of pointing,
as you can see if you think about what you use your index finger for,
or if you notice
that the entries in a book's index
point at the referenced parts of the book.
We frequently speak casually of an index variable
``pointing at'' some cell of an array,
even though it's not a true pointer variable.)
</p><p>One facet of the <TT>getline</TT> function's interface might bear mentioning:
its first argument,
the character array <TT>s</TT>,
is being used to return the line that it reads.
This may seem to contradict the rule that a function can never 
modify the value of a variable in its caller.
As was briefly mentioned on page 28,
there's an exception for arrays,
which we'll be learning about in chapter 5;
for now, we'll gloss over the point.
(Actually, we're glossing over two points:
not only is <TT>getline</TT> able to return a value via an argument,
but the argument isn't really an array,
although it's declared as and looks like one.
Please forgive these gentle fictions;
explaining them completely would really be premature at this point.
Perhaps they weren't worth mentioning yet, after all.)
</p><p>For comparison, here is yet another version of <TT>getline</TT>:
<pre>int getline(char s[], int lim)
{
	int c, i = 0;
<br>
<br>
	while(--lim &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (c=getchar()) != EOF) {
		s[i++] = c;
		if(c == '\n')
			break;
	}
<br>
<br>
	s[i] = '\0';
<br>
<br>
	return i;
}
</pre>Note that by using <TT>break</TT>,
we avoid having to test for <TT>'\n'</TT> in two different places.
</p><p>If you're having trouble seeing how the <TT>strindex</TT> function works,
its algorithm is
<pre>	for (<I>each position</I> i <I>in</I> s)
		if (t <I>occurs at position</I> i <I>in</I> s)
			return i;
<br>
<br>
	<I>(else)</I> return -1;
</pre>Filling in the details of
``<TT>if (t</TT> <I>occurs at position</I> <TT>i</TT> <I>in</I> <TT>s)</TT>'',
we have:
<pre>	for (<I>each position</I> i <I>in</I> s)
		for (<I>each character in</I> t)
			if (<I>it matches the corresponding character in</I> s)
				if (<I>it's</I> '\0')
					return i;
				else	<I>keep going</I>
			else	<I>no match at position</I> i
<br>
<br>
	<I>(else)</I> return -1;
</pre>A slightly less compressed implementation
than the one on page 69 would be:
<pre>int strindex(char s[], char t[])
{
	int i, j, k;
<br>
<br>
	for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {
		for(j = i, k = 0; t[k] != '\0'; j++, k++)
			if(s[j] != t[k])
				break;
<br>
<br>
		if(t[k] == '\0')
			return i;
	}
<br>
<br>
	return -1;
}
</pre>Note that we have to check for the end of the string <TT>t</TT> twice:
once to see if we're at the end of it in the innermost loop,
and again to see <em>why</em> we terminated the innermost loop.
(If we terminated the innermost loop
because we reached the end of <TT>t</TT>,
we found a match;
otherwise, we didn't.)
We could rearrange things to remove the duplicated test:
<pre>int strindex(char s[], char t[])
{
	int i, j, k;
<br>
<br>
	for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {
		j = i;
		k = 0;
<br>
<br>
		do {
			if(t[k] == '\0')
				return i;
		} while(s[j++] == t[k++]);
		
	}
<br>
<br>
	return -1;
}
</pre>It's a matter of style
which implementation of <TT>strindex</TT> is preferable;
it's impossible to say which is ``best.''
(Can you see a slight difference
in the behavior of the version on page 69
versus the two here?
Under what circumstance(s) would this difference be significant?
How would the version on page 69 behave under those circumstances,
and how would the two routines here behave?)
</p><p>page 70
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>A program is just a set of definitions of variables and functions.
</blockquote>This sentence may or may not seem deep,
and it may or may not <em>be</em> deep,
but it's a fundamental definition of what a C program is.
</p><p>Note that
a function's return value
is automatically converted
to the return type of the function, if necessary,
just as in assignments like
<pre>	f = i;
</pre>where <TT>f</TT> is <TT>float</TT> and <TT>i</TT> is <TT>int</TT>.
</p><p>Most programmers do use parentheses around the expression
in a <TT>return</TT> statement,
because that way it looks more like <TT>while()</TT>, <TT>for()</TT>, etc.
The reason the parentheses are optional is that the formal syntax is
<pre>	return <I>expression</I> ;
</pre>and,
as we know,
any expression surrounded by parentheses is another expression.
</p><p>It's debatable whether it's ``not illegal''
for a function to have <TT>return</TT> statements with and 
without values.
It's a ``sign of trouble'' at best, and undefined at worst.
Another
clear sign of trouble
(which is equally undefined)
is
when
a function returns
no value,
or is declared as <TT>void</TT>,
but a caller attempts to use the return value.
</p><p>The <TT>main</TT> program on page 69
returns the number of matching lines found.
This is probably better than returning nothing,
but the convention is usually that a C program returns 0 when 
it succeeds and a positive number when it fails.
