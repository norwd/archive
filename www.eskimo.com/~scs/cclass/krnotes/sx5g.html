<H2>section 2.7: Type Conversions</H2>

<p>The conversion rules described here and on page 44 are straightforward,
but they're quite important,
so you'll need to learn them well.
Usually,
conversions happen automatically and when you want them to,
but not always,
so it's important to keep
the rules in mind.
(Recall the discussion of <TT>5/9</TT> on page 12.)
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>A <TT>char</TT> is just a small integer,
so <TT>char</TT>s may be freely used in arithmetic expressions.
</blockquote>Whether you treat a ``small integer'' as a character 
or an integer is pretty much up to you.
As we saw earlier,
in the ASCII character set,
the character <TT>'0'</TT> has the value 48.
Therefore, saying
<pre>	int i = '0';
</pre>is the same as saying
<pre>	int i = 48;
</pre>If you print <TT>i</TT> out as a character,
using
<pre>	putchar(i);
</pre>or
<pre>	printf("%c", i);
</pre>(the <TT>%c</TT> format prints characters; see page 13),
you'll see the character <TT>'0'</TT>.
If you print it out as a number:
<pre>	printf("%d", i);
</pre>you'll see the value 48.
</p><p>Most of the time,
you'll use whatever notation matches what you're trying to do.
If you want the character <TT>'0'</TT>,
you'll use <TT>'0'</TT>.
If you want the value 48
(as the number of months in four years, or something),
you'll use <TT>48</TT>.
If you want to print characters,
you'll use <TT>putchar</TT> or <TT>printf</TT> <TT>%c</TT>,
and if you want to print integers,
you'll use <TT>printf</TT> <TT>%d</TT>.
Occasionally, you'll cross over between
thinking of characters as characters and as values,
such as in the character-counting program in section 1.6 on page 22,
or in the <TT>atoi</TT> function we'll look at next.
(You should never have to know that <TT>'0'</TT> has the value 48,
and you should never have to write code which depends on it.)
</p><p>page 43
</p><p>To illustrate the ``schitzophrenic'' nature of characters
(are they characters, or are they small integer values?),
it's useful to look at an implementation of the standard
library function <TT>atoi</TT>.
(If you're getting overwhelmed, though, you may skip this
example for now, and come back to it later.)
The <TT>atoi</TT> routine converts a string like <TT>"123"</TT>
into an integer having the corresponding value.
</p><p>As you study the <TT>atoi</TT> code at the top of page 43,
figure out why it does <em>not</em> seem to explicitly check 
for the terminating <TT>'\0'</TT> character.
</p><p>The expression
<pre>	s[i] - '0'
</pre>is an example of the ``crossing over''
between thinking about a character and its value.
Since the value of the character <TT>'0'</TT> is not zero
(and, similarly, the other numeric characters
don't have their ``obvious'' values, either),
we have to do a little conversion
to get the value 0 from the character <TT>'0'</TT>,
the value 1 from the character <TT>'1'</TT>, etc.
Since
the character set values for
the digit characters <TT>'0'</TT> to <TT>'9'</TT> are contiguous
(48-57, if you must know),
the conversion involves simply subtracting an offset,
and the offset
(if you think about it)
is simply the value of the character <TT>'0'</TT>.
We could write
<pre>	s[i] - 48
</pre>if we really wanted to,
but that would require knowing what the value actually is.
We shouldn't have to know
(and it might be different in some other character set),
so we can let the compiler do the dirty work
by using <TT>'0'</TT> as the offset
(since subtracting <TT>'0'</TT> is,
by definition,
the same as subtracting the value of the character <TT>'0'</TT>).
</p><p>The functions from <TT>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</TT> are being introduced 
here without a lot of fanfare.
Here is the main loop of the <TT>atoi</TT> routine,
rewritten to use <TT>isdigit</TT>:
<pre>	for (i = 0; isdigit(s[i]); ++i)
		n = 10 * n + (s[i] - '0');
</pre></p><p>Don't worry too much about the discussion of
signed vs. unsigned characters for now.
(Don't forget about it completely, though;
eventually,
you'll find yourself working with a program where the issue is significant.)
For now, just remember:
<OL><li>Use <TT>int</TT> as the type of any variable
which receives the return value from <TT>getchar</TT>,
as discussed in section 1.5.1 on page 16.
<li>If you're ever dealing with arbitrary ``bytes'' of binary data,
you'll usually want to use <TT>unsigned char</TT>.
</OL></p><p>page 44
</p><p>As we saw in section 2.6 on page 44,
relational and logical operators always ``return'' 1 for ``true'' 
and 0 for ``false.''
However,
when C wants to know whether something is true or false,
it just looks at whether it's nonzero or zero,
so any nonzero value is considered ``true.''
Finally,
some functions which return true/false values
(the text mentions <TT>isdigit</TT>)
may return ``true'' values of other than 1.
</p><p>You don't have to worry about these distinctions too much,
and you also don't have to worry about the fragment
<pre>	d = c &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= '9'
</pre>as long as you write conditionals in a sensible way.
If you wanted to see
whether two variables <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> were equal,
you'd never write
<pre>	if((a == b) == 1)
</pre>(although it <em>would</em> work:
the <TT>==</TT> operator ``returns'' 1 if 

they're equal).
Similarly,
you don't want to write
<pre>	if(isdigit(c) == 1)
</pre>because it's equally silly-looking,
and in this case it might <em>not</em> work.
Just write things like
<pre>	if(a == b)
</pre>and
<pre>	if(isdigit(c))
</pre>and you'll steer clear of most problems.
(Make sure, though, that you never try something like
<TT>if('0' &lt;= c &lt;= '9'</TT>),
since this wouldn't do at all what it looks like it's supposed to.)
</p><p>The set of implicit conversions on page 44,
though informally stated,
is exactly the set to remember for now.
They're easy to remember if you notice that,
as the authors say,
``the `lower' type is <dfn>promoted</dfn> to the `higher' type,''
where the ``order'' of the types is
<pre>	char &lt; short int &lt; int &lt; long int &lt; float &lt; double &lt; long double
</pre>(We won't be using <TT>long double</TT>,
so you don't need to worry about it.)
We'll have more to say about these rules on the next page.
</p><p>Don't worry too much for now
about the additional rules for <TT>unsigned</TT> values,
because we won't be using them at first.
</p><p>Do notice that implicit (automatic) conversions do happen 
across assignments.
It's perfectly acceptable to
assign a <TT>char</TT> to an <TT>int</TT> or vice versa,
or
assign an <TT>int</TT> to a <TT>float</TT> or vice versa
(or any other combination).
Obviously, when you assign a value from a larger type to a 
smaller one,
there's a chance that it might not fit.
Therefore, compilers will often warn you about such assignments.
</p><p>page 45
</p><p><dfn>Casts</dfn> can be a bit confusing at first.
A <dfn>cast</dfn> is the syntax used to request an explicit type conversion;
<dfn>coercion</dfn> is just a more formal word for ``conversion.''
A cast consists of a type name in parentheses
and is used as a unary operator.
You may have used languages
which had conversion operators
which looked more like function calls:
<pre>	integer i = 2;
	floating f = floating(i);	/* not C */
	integer i2 = integer(f);	/* not C */
</pre>
In C,
you accomplish the same thing with casts:
<pre>	int i = 2;
	float f = (float)i;
	int i2 = (int)f;
</pre>(Actually, in C,
we wouldn't need casts in those initializations at all,
because conversions between <TT>int</TT> and <TT>float</TT>
are some of the ones that C performs automatically.)
</p><p>To further understand both how implicit conversions
and explicit casts work,
let's study how the implicit conversions would look
if we wrote them out explicitly.
First we'll declare a few variables of various types:
<pre>	char c1, c2;
	int i1, i2;
	long int L1, L2;
	double d1, d2;
</pre>Next we'll look at the kinds of conversions which C
automatically performs when performing arithmetic on two
dissimilar types, or when assigning a value to a dissimilar type.
The rules are straightforward:
when performing arithmetic on two dissimilar types,
C converts one or both sides to a common type;
and when assigning a value,
C converts it to the type of the variable being assigned to.
</p><p>If we add a <TT>char</TT> to an <TT>int</TT>:
<pre>	i2 = c1 + i1;
</pre>the fourth rule on page 44 tells us to convert the <TT>char</TT> to an <TT>int</TT>,
as if we'd written
<pre>	i2 = (int)c1 + i1;
</pre>If we multiply a <TT>long int</TT> and a <TT>double</TT>:
<pre>	d2 = L1 * d1;
</pre>the second rule tells us to convert the <TT>long int</TT> to a <TT>double</TT>,
as if we'd written
<pre>	d2 = (double)L1 * d1;
</pre>An assignment of a <TT>char</TT> to an <TT>int</TT>
<pre>	i1 = c1;
</pre>is as if we'd written
<pre>	i1 = (int)c1;
</pre>and
an assignment of a <TT>float</TT> to an <TT>int</TT>
<pre>	i1 = f1;
</pre>is as if we'd written
<pre>	i1 = (int)f1;
</pre></p><p>Some programmers worry that implicit conversions are somehow unreliable
and prefer to insert lots of explicit conversions.
I recommend that you get comfortable with implicit 
conversions--they're quite useful--and don't clutter your 
code with extra casts.
</p><p>There are a few places where you do need casts, however.
Consider the code
<pre>	i1 = 200;
	i2 = 400;
	L1 = i1 * i2;
</pre>The product
200 x 400 is 80000,
which is not guaranteed to fit into an <TT>int</TT>.
(Remember that an <TT>int</TT> is only guaranteed to hold
values up to 32767.)
Since 80000 <em>will</em> fit into a <TT>long int</TT>,
you might think that you're okay, but you're not:
the two sides of the multiplication are of the same type,
so the compiler doesn't see the need to perform any automatic conversions
(none of the rules on page 44 apply).
The
multiplication is carried out as an <TT>int</TT>,
which overflows with unpredictable results,
and only after the damage has been done is the unpredictable 
value converted to a <TT>long int</TT> for assignment to <TT>L1</TT>.
To get a multiplication like this to work,
you have to explicitly convert at least one of the <TT>int</TT>'s 
to <TT>long int</TT>:
<pre>	L1 = (long int)i1 * i2;
</pre>Now,
the two sides of the <TT>*</TT> are of different types,
so they're <em>both</em> converted to <TT>long int</TT>
(by the fifth rule on page 44),
and the multiplication is carried out as a <TT>long int</TT>.
If it makes you feel safer, you can use two casts:
<pre>	L1 = (long int)i1 * (long int)i2;
</pre>but only one is strictly required.
</p><p>A similar problem arises when two integers are being divided.
The code
<pre>	i1 = 1;
	f1 = i1 / 2;
</pre>does not set f1 to 0.5, it sets it to 0.
Again,
the two operands of the <TT>/</TT> operand are already of the same type
(the rules on page 44 still don't apply),
so an integer division is performed,
which discards any fractional part.
(We saw a similar problem in section 1.2 on page 12.)
Again, an explicit conversion saves the day:
<pre>	f1 = (float)i1 / 2;
</pre>Alternately,
in a case like this,
you can use a floating-point constant:
<pre>	f1 = i1 / 2.0;
</pre>In either case,
as soon as one of the operands is floating point,
the division is carried out in floating point,
and you get the result you expect.
</p><p>Implicit conversions always happen during arithmetic and 
assignment to variables.
The situation is a bit more complicated when functions are 
being called, however.
</p><p>The authors use the example of the <TT>sqrt</TT> function,
which is as good an example as any.
<TT>sqrt</TT> accepts an argument of type <TT>double</TT>
and returns a value of type <TT>double</TT>.
If the compiler didn't know that <TT>sqrt</TT> took a <TT>double</TT>,
and if you called
<pre>	sqrt(4);
</pre>or
<pre>	int n = 4;
	sqrt(n);
</pre>the compiler would pass an <TT>int</TT> to <TT>sqrt</TT>.
Since <TT>sqrt</TT> expects a <TT>double</TT>,
it will not work correctly if it receives an <TT>int</TT>.
Therefore,
it was once
always
necessary to use explicit conversions in cases like 
this,
by calling
<pre>	sqrt((double)4)
</pre>or
<pre>	sqrt((double)n)
</pre>or
<pre>	sqrt(4.0)
</pre></p><p>However,
it is now possible,
with a <dfn>function prototype</dfn>,
to tell the compiler what types of arguments a function expects.
The prototype for <TT>sqrt</TT> is
<pre>	double sqrt(double);
</pre>and as long as a prototype is in effect
(``in scope,'' as the cognoscenti would say),
you can call <TT>sqrt</TT> without worrying about conversions.
When a prototype is in effect,
the compiler performs implicit conversions during function calls
(specifically, while passing the arguments)
exactly as it does during simple assignments.
</p><p>Obviously, using prototypes makes for much safer programming,
and it is recommended that
you use them
whenever possible.
For the standard library functions
(the ones already written for you),
you get prototypes automatically
when you include the <dfn>header files</dfn> which describe
sets of library functions.
For example,
you
get prototypes for all of C's built-in math functions 
by putting the line
<pre>	#include &lt;math.h&gt;
</pre>at the top of your program.
For functions that you write,
you can supply your own prototypes,
which

we'll be learning more about later.
</p><p>However, there are a few situations
(we'll talk about them later)
where prototypes do not apply,
so it's important to remember that function calls are a bit 
different
and that
explicit conversions (i.e. casts) may 
occasionally be required.
Don't imagine that prototypes are a panacea.
