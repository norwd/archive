<H2>section 5.7: Multi-dimensional Arrays</H2>

page 111
<p>The <TT>month_day</TT> function is another example of a 
function which simulates having multiple return values by using 
pointer parameters.
<TT>month_day</TT> is declared as <TT>void</TT>,
so it has no formal return value,
but two of its parameters,
<TT>pmonth</TT> and <TT>pday</TT>,
are pointers,
and it fills in the locations
pointed to by these two pointers
with the two values it wants to ``return.''
One line of the definition of <TT>month_day</TT> on page 111 
is cut off in all printings I have seen:
it should read
<pre>	void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday)
</pre></p><p>As we've said,
although any nonzero value is considered ``true'' in C,
the built-in relational and Boolean operators
always ``return'' 0 or 1.
Therefore,
the line
<pre>	int leap = year%4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year%100 != 0 || year%400 == 0;
</pre>sets <TT>leap</TT> to 1 or 0
(``true'' or ``false'')
depending on the condition
<pre>	year%4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year%100 != 0 || year%400 == 0
</pre>which is the condition for leap years in the Gregorian calendar.

(It's a little-known fact that century years are not leap years 
unless they are also divisible by 400.
Thus, 2000 <em>will</em> be a leap year.)
The 1/0 value that <TT>leap</TT> receives
is what
the authors are referring to
when they say that
``the arithmetic value of a logical expression... can
be used as a subscript of the array <TT>daytab</TT>.''
This line could also have been written
<pre>	int leap;
	if (year%4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year%100 != 0 || year%400 == 0)
		leap = 1;
	else
		leap = 0;
</pre>or
<pre>	int leap = (year%4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year%100 != 0 || year%400 == 0) ? 1 : 0;
</pre></p><p>page 112
</p><p>The <TT>daytab</TT> array holds small integers (in the range 0-31),
so it can legally be made an array of <TT>char</TT>,
though whether this is a legitimate use is a question of style.
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>In C,
a two-dimensional array is really a one-dimensional array,
each of whose elements is an array.
</blockquote>Earlier we said that ``array-of-<I>type</I> is another type,''
and here we must believe it:
since array-of-<I>type</I> is a type,
array-of-(array-of-<I>type</I>) is yet another type.
</p><p>The statement that
``Elements are stored by rows,
so the rightmost subscript, or column,
varies fastest as elements are accessed in storage order''
probably won't make much sense
unless you've done a lot of work with other languages,
such as FORTRAN,
which do have true multi-dimensional arrays.
It's pretty arbitrary what you call a ``row'' and what you call a ``column'';
the most important thing to know is which subscript goes with which dimension.
If you have
<pre>	int a[10][20];
</pre>then in the reference <TT>a[i][j]</TT>,
<TT>i</TT> can range from 0 to 9
and <TT>j</TT> can range from 0 to 19.
In other words, you might write
<pre>	for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
		for (j = 0; j &lt; 20; j++)
			<I>do something with</I> a[i][j]
</pre></p><p>We also want to know what <TT>a</TT> actually is.
Is it an array of 10 arrays, each of size 20,
or is it an array of 20 arrays, each of size 10?
There are other ways of convincing ourselves of the answer,
but for now let's just say that the ``closer'' dimensions are 
closer to what <TT>a</TT> is.
Therefore, <TT>a</TT> is first an array of size 10,
and what it's an array of is arrays of 20 <TT>int</TT>s.
This also tells us that if we ever refer to <TT>a[i]</TT>
(without a second subscript),
then we're referring to just one of those 10 arrays
(of size 20)
in its entirety.
</p><p>When we look back
at the initialization of the <TT>daytab</TT> array on page 111,
everything lines up.
<TT>daytab</TT> is defined as
<pre>	char daytab[2][13]
</pre>and we can see from the initializer that there are two (sub)arrays,
each of size 13.
(We can also see that there is some justification
for saying that the first subscript refers to ``rows''
and the second to ``columns.'')
</p><p>The authors illustrate one way of dealing with C's 0-based 
arrays when you have an algorithm that really wants to treat an 
array as if it were 1-based.
Here, rather than remembering
to subtract one from the 1-based month number each time,
they chose to waste a ``column'' of the array,
and declare it one larger than necessary,
so that they could refer to subscripts from [1] to [12].
</p><p>One last note about the initialization of <TT>daytab</TT>:
you may have seen code in other programming books that kept an 
array of the cumulative days of all the months:
<pre>	{0, 31, 59, 90, 120, 151, 181, 212, 243, 273, 304, 334, 365}
</pre>Precomputing an array like that
might make things a tiny bit easier on the computer
(it wouldn't have to loop through the entire array each time,
as it does in the <TT>day_of_year</TT> function),
but it makes it considerably harder to see what the numbers mean,
and to verify that they are correct.
The simple table of individual month lengths is much clearer,
and if the computer has to do a bit more grunge work,
well, that's what computers are for.
As explained in another book co-authored by Brian Kernighan:

<blockquote>A cumulative table of days must be calculated by someone
and checked by someone else.
Since few people are familiar
with the number of days up to the end of a particular month,
neither writing nor checking is easy.
But if instead we use a table of days per month,
we can let the computer count them for us.
(``Let the machine do the dirty work.'')
</blockquote></p><p>The bottom of page 112 begins to get confusing.
The ``number of rows'' of an array like <TT>daytab</TT>
``is irrelevant'' when passed to a function such as the 
hypothetical <TT>f</TT> because the compiler doesn't need to 
know the number of rows when calculating subscripts.
It does need to know the number of columns or ``width,''
because that's how it knows that the second element on the 
second row of a 10-column array is actually 12 cells past the 
beginning of the array, which is essentially what it needs to 
know when it goes off and actually accesses the array in memory.
But it doesn't need to know how long the overall array is,
as long as we promise not to run off the end of it,
and that's always up to us.
(This is why we haven't specified the array sizes
in the definitions of functions such as
<TT>getline</TT> on pages 29 and 69,
or <TT>atoi</TT> on pages 43, 61, and 73,
or <TT>readlines</TT> on page 109,
although we did carry the array size as a separate argument
to <TT>getline</TT> and <TT>readlines</TT>,
to assist us in our promise not to run off the end.)
</p><p>The third version
of <TT>f</TT>
on page 112
comes about because of the ``gentle fiction''
involving array parameters.
We learned on page 99
that functions don't really receive arrays as parameters;
they receive pointers
(since any array passed by the caller decayed immediately to a pointer).
On page 39 we wrote a <TT>strlen</TT> function as
<pre>	int strlen(char s[])
</pre>but on page 99 we rewrote it as 
<pre>	int strlen(char *s)
</pre>which is closer to the way the compiler sees the situation.
(In fact, when we write <TT>int strlen(char s[])</TT>,
the compiler essentially rewrites it as
<TT>int strlen(char *s)</TT> for us.)
In the same way,
a function declared as
<pre>	f(int daytab[][13])
</pre>can be rewritten by us
(or if not, is rewritten by the compiler)
to
<pre>	f(int (*daytab)[13])
</pre>which declares the <TT>daytab</TT> parameter as a 
pointer-to-array-of-13-<TT>int</TT>s.
Here we see two things:
(1)
the rewrite
which changes an array parameter to a pointer parameter
happens only once
(we end up with a pointer to an array,
not a pointer to a pointer),
and
(2)
the syntax for pointers to arrays is a bit messy,
because of some required extra parentheses,
as explained in the text.
</p><p>If this seems obscure, don't worry about it too much;
just declare functions with array parameters matching the 
arrays you call them with,
like
<pre>	f(int daytab[2][13])
</pre>and let the compiler worry about the rewriting.
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>More generally,
only the first dimension (subscript) of an array is free;
all the others have to be specified.
</blockquote>This just says what we said already:
when declaring an array as a function parameter,
you can leave off the first dimension
because it is the overall length
and not knowing it causes no immediate problems
(unless you accidentally go off the end).
But the compiler always needs to know the other dimensions,
so that it knows how the rows and columns line up.
