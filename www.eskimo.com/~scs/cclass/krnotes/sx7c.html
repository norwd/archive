<H2>section 4.3: External Variables</H2>

<p>The word ``external'' is, roughly speaking, equivalent to ``global.''
</p><p>page 74
</p><p>A program with
``too many data connections between functions''
hasn't managed to achieve
the desirable attributes
we were talking about earlier,
in particular that a function's
``interface to the rest of the program is clean and narrow.''
Another bit of jargon you may hear is the word ``coupling,''
which refers to how much one piece of a program has to know
about another.
</p><p>In general,
as we have mentioned,
the connections between functions should generally be few and well-defined,
in which case they will be amenable to regular old function arguments,
and you won't be tempted to pass lots of data around in global variables.
(On the other hand,
global variables are fine for some things,
such as
configuration information which the whole program cares about
and which is set just once at program startup and then doesn't change.)
</p><p>The word ``lifetime'' refers to how long a variable and its value stick around.
(The jargon term is ``duration.'')
So far, we've seen that global variables persist for the life of the program,
while local variables last only as long
as the functions defining them are active.
However, lifetime (duration) is a separate and orthogonal concept from scope;
we'll soon be meeting local variables which persist for the life of the program.
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>Thus if two functions must share some data,
yet neither calls the other,
it is often most convenient
if the shared data is kept in external variables
rather than passed in and out via arguments.
</blockquote>(Later,
though,
we'll learn about data structures
which can make it more convenient
to pass certain data around via function arguments,
so we'll have less reason for using external variables
for these sorts of purposes.)
</p><p>``Reverse Polish'' is used by some
(earlier, all)
Hewlett-Packard calculators.
(The name is based on the nationality of the mathematician who
studied and formalized this notation.)
It may seem strange at first,
but it's natural if you observe that you need both numbers (operands)
before you can carry out an operation on them.
(This fact is one of the reasons that reverse Polish notation
is ``easier to implement.'')
</p><p>The calculator example is a bit long and a bit involved,
but I urge you to work through and understand it.
A calculator is something that everyone's likely to be familiar with;
it's interesting to see how one might work inside;
and the techniques used here are generally useful in all sorts of programs.
</p><p>A ``stack'' is simply a last-in, first-out list.
You ``push'' data items onto a stack,
and whenever you ``pop'' an item from the stack,
you get the one most recently pushed.
</p><p>pages 76-79
</p><p>The code for the calculator may seem daunting at first,
but it's much easier to follow if you look at each part in isolation
(as good functions are meant to be looked at),
and notice that the routines fall into three levels.
At the top level is the calculator itself,
which resides in the function <TT>main</TT>.
The main function calls three lower-level functions:
<TT>push</TT>, <TT>pop</TT>, and <TT>getop</TT>.
<TT>getop</TT>, in turn,
is written in terms of the still lower-level functions 
<TT>getch</TT> and <TT>ungetch</TT>.
</p><p>A few details of the communication among these functions deserve mention.
The <TT>getop</TT> routine actually returns two values.
Its formal return value is a character
representing the next operation to be performed.
Usually,
that character is just
the character the user typed,
that is, <TT>+</TT>, <TT>-</TT>, <TT>*</TT>, or <TT>/</TT>.
In the case of a number typed by the user,
the special code <TT>NUMBER</TT> is returned
(which happens to be <TT>#define</TT>d to be the character <TT>'0'</TT>,
but that's arbitrary).
A return value of <TT>NUMBER</TT>
indicates that an entire string of digits has been typed,
and the string itself is copied into the array <TT>s</TT>
passed to <TT>getop</TT>.
In this case,
therefore,
the array <TT>s</TT> is the second return value.
</p><p>In some printings,
the second line on page 76 reads
<pre>	#include &lt;math.h&gt;	/* for atof() */
</pre>which is incorrect;
it should be
<pre>	#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;	/* for atof() */
</pre></p><p>page 77
</p><p>Make sure you understand why the code
<pre>	push(pop() - pop());	/* WRONG */
</pre>might not work correctly.
</p><p>``The representation can be hidden''
means that the declarations of these variables can follow 
<TT>main</TT> in the file, such that main can't ``see'' them
(that is, can't attempt to refer to them).
Furthermore,
as we'll see,
the declarations might be moved to a separate source file,
and <TT>main</TT> won't care.
</p><p>pages 77-78
</p><p>Note that <TT>getop</TT> does not incorporate the 
functionality of <TT>atoi</TT> or <TT>atof</TT>--it
collects and returns the digits as a string,
and <TT>main</TT> calls <TT>atof</TT> to convert the string 
to a floating-point number (prior to pushing it on the stack).
(There's nothing profound about this arrangement;
there's no particular reason why
<TT>getop</TT> couldn't have been set up to do the conversion itself.)
</p><p>The reasons for using a routine like <TT>ungetch</TT> are good and sufficient,
but they may not be obvious at first.
The essential motivation,
as the authors explain,
is that when we're reading a string of digits,
we don't know when we've reached the end of the string of digits
until we've read a non-digit,
and that non-digit is not part of the string of digits,
so we really shouldn't have read it yet,
after all.
The rest of the program is set up based on the assumption that 
one call to <TT>getop</TT> will return the string of digits,
and the <em>next</em> call will return whatever operator 
followed the string of digits.
</p><p>
To understand why the surprising
and perhaps kludgey-sounding
<TT>getch</TT>/<TT>ungetch</TT>
approach is in fact a good one,
let's consider the alternatives.
<TT>getop</TT> could keep track of the one-too-far character somehow,
and remember to use it next time instead of reading a new character.
(Exercise 4-11 asks you to implement exactly this.)
But this arrangement of <TT>getop</TT> is considerably less 
clean from the standpoint of the ``invariants'' we were discussing 
earlier.
<TT>getop</TT> can be written relatively cleanly if one of its 
invariants is that the operator it's getting is always formed 
by reading the next character(s) from the input stream.
<TT>getop</TT> would be considerably messier if it always had 
to remember to use an old character if it had one,
or read a new character otherwise.
If <TT>getop</TT> were modified later
to read new kinds of operators,
and if reading them involved reading more characters,
it would be easy to forget to take into account the possibility 
of an old character each time a new character was needed.
In other words,
everywhere that
<TT>getop</TT> wanted to do the operation
<pre>	<I>read the next character</I>
</pre>it would instead have to do
<pre>	if (<I>there's an old character</I>)
		<I>use it</I>
	else
		<I>read the next character</I>
</pre>It's much cleaner to push the checking for an old character 
down into the <TT>getch</TT> routine.
</p><p>Devising a pair of routines like <TT>getch</TT> and <TT>ungetch</TT>
is an excellent example of the process of <dfn>abstraction</dfn>.
We had a problem:
while reading a string of digits,
we always read one character too far.
The obvious solution--remembering the one-too-far character
and using it later--would have been clumsy if we'd 
implemented it directly within <TT>getop</TT>.
So we invented some new functions to centralize and encapsulate 
the functionality of remembering accidentally-read characters,
so that <TT>getop</TT> could be written cleanly in terms of a 
simple ``get next character'' operation.
By centralizing the functionality,
we make it easy for <TT>getop</TT> to use it consistently,
and by encapsulating it,
we hide the (potentially ugly) details from the rest of the program.
<TT>getch</TT> and <TT>ungetch</TT> may be tricky to write,
but once we've written them,
we can seal up the little black boxes they're in
and not worry about them any more,
and the rest of the program
(especially <TT>getop</TT>)
is cleaner.
</p><p>page 79
</p><p>If you're not used to the conditional operator <TT>?:</TT> yet,
here's how <TT>getch</TT> would look without it:
<pre>	int getch(void)
	{
		if (bufp &gt; 0)
			return buf[--bufp];
		else	return getchar();
	}	
</pre>Also, the extra generality of these two routines
(namely, that they can push back and remember several characters,
a feature which the calculator program doesn't even use)
makes them a bit harder to follow.
Exercise 4-8 asks you two write simpler versions which allow 
only one character of pushback.
(Also, as the text notes,
we don't really have to be writing <TT>ungetch</TT> at all,
because the standard library already provides an 
<TT>ungetc</TT> which
can provide one character of pushback for
<TT>getchar</TT>.)
</p><p>When we defined a stack,
we said that it was ``last-in, first-out.''
Are the versions of <TT>getch</TT> and <TT>ungetch</TT> on 
page 79 last-in, first-out or first-in, first out?
Do you agree with this choice?
</p><p>One last note:
the name of the variable <TT>bufp</TT> suggests that it is a pointer,
but it's actually an index into the <TT>buf</TT> array.
