<H2>section 3.8: Goto and Labels</H2>

pages 65-66
<p>A tremendous amount of impassioned debate surrounds the lowly 
<TT>goto</TT> statement, which exists in many languages.
Some people say that <TT>goto</TT>s are fine;
others say that they must <strong>never</strong> be used.
You should definitely shy away from <TT>goto</TT>s,
but don't be dogmatic about it;
some day,
you'll find yourself writing some screwy piece of code where 
trying to avoid a <TT>goto</TT>
(by introducing extra tests or Boolean control variables)
would only make things worse.
</p><p></p><p>page 66
</p><p>When you find yourself writing several nested loops
in order to search for something,
such that you would need to use a <TT>goto</TT>
to break out of all of them
when you do find what you're looking for,
it's often an excellent idea to 
move
the search code out into a separate function.
Doing so
can make both the ``found'' and ``not found'' cases
easier to handle.
Here's a slight variation on the example in the middle of page 66,
written as a function:
<pre>	/* return i such that a[i] == b[j] for some j, or -1 if none */
<br>
<br>
	int findequal(int a[], int na, int b[], int nb)
	{
		int i, j;
<br>
<br>
		for(i = 0; i &lt; na; i++) {
			for(j = 0; j &lt; nb; j++) {
				if(a[i] == b[j])
					return i;
			}
		}
<br>
<br>
		return -1;
	}
</pre>This function can then be called as
<pre>	i = findequal(a, na, b, nb);
	if(i == -1)
		/* didn't find any common element */
	else	/* got one */
</pre>(The only disadvantage here is that it's trickier to return 
<TT>i</TT> and <TT>j</TT> if we need them both.)
