page ix
<p>You'll get some hint here that C has become a bit more formal 
as it has ``grown up.''
That formality is appropriate,
and for the second edition of K&amp;R to acknowledge it is 
appropriate,
and for any modern course in C programming to teach it is 
appropriate.
Personally, I learned C before it had become quite so 
formalized, and occasionally my traditional biases will leak 
through.
I'll try to admit it when they do.
</p><p>As the authors note,
C is a relatively small language,
but one which
(to
its admirers, anyway)
wears well.
C's small, unambitious feature set is a real advantage:
there's less to learn;
there isn't excess baggage in the way when you don't need it.
It can also be a disadvantage:
since it doesn't do everything for you,
there's a lot you have to do yourself.
(Actually, this is viewed by many as an additional advantage:
anything the language doesn't do for you,
it doesn't dictate to you, either,
so you're free to do that something however you want.)
