<H2>section 5.6: Pointer Arrays; Pointers to Pointers</H2>

page 107
<p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>Since pointers are variables themselves,
they can be stored in arrays just as other variables can.
</blockquote>This is just one aspect of the generality of C's data types,
which we'll be seeing in the next few sections.
</p><p>We've used a recursive definition of ``expression'':
a constant or variable is an expression,
an expression in parentheses is an expression,
an expression plus an expression is an expression,
etc.
There are
obviously an infinite number of expressions,
of arbitrary complexity.
In exactly the same way,
there are an infinite number of data types in C.
We've already seen the basic data types:
<TT>int</TT>, <TT>char</TT>, <TT>double</TT>, etc.
But then we have the <dfn>derived</dfn> data types
such as array-of-<TT>char</TT> and pointer-to-<TT>int</TT>
and function-returning-<TT>double</TT>.
So we can say that
for any type,
array-of-<I>type</I> is another type,
and pointer-to-<I>type</I> is another type,
and function-returning-<I>type</I> is another type.
Once we've said that,
we can see that there is also the 
possibility of arrays of pointers,
and arrays of arrays,
and functions returning pointers,
and even
(in section 5.11, though this is a deeper topic)
pointers to functions.
(The only possibilities that C doesn't support are
functions returning arrays,
and arrays of functions,
and functions returning functions.)
</p><p>Make sure you understand why an integer is something that 
<em>can</em> be ``compared or moved in a single operation,''
but that a string
(that is, an array of <TT>char</TT>)
is <em>not</em>.
Then,
realize that a pointer is also something that can be
``compared or moved in a single operation.''
(Actually, though, the string comparisons we'll be doing
are not single operations.)
From time to time you'll hear me caution you
not to worry too much about certain aspects of efficiency.
Here, it's true that
the overhead of copying entire strings from one place to another,
a character at a time
(which is the overhead we'll be getting around
by manipulating pointers instead)
can be significant,
but that's not the only concern:
once we're comfortable with the idea,
manipulating pointers will be somewhat easier on <em>us</em>, too.
(Copying lots of characters around is a nuisance,
and it can also be dangerous,
if the destination isn't big enough or isn't in the right place.)
</p><p>Don't worry
about the ``one long character array'' that 
the
``lines to be sorted are stored end-to-end in.''
Instead,
look
at the picture at the bottom of page 107,
which shows the pointers that might be set up after reading the 
lines
<pre>	defghi
	jklmnopqrst
	abc
</pre>On the left are the pointers before sorting,
and on the right are the pointers after sorting.
The three strings have not been moved,
but by reshuffling the pointers,
the three pointers in order now point to the lines
<pre>	abc
	defghi
	jklmnopqrst
</pre></p><p>page 108
</p><p>Once again,
we see a nice simple decomposition of the problem,
which might seem deceptively simple
except that when problems are decomposed in simple ways like this,
and then implemented faithfully,
they really <em>can</em> be this simple.
Deferring the sorting step is an excellent idea,
especially if we didn't quite follow the details of the sorting 
functions in the previous chapter.
(Actually, in practice,
we can usually defer the sorting step forever,
since there's often a general-purpose sort routine
provided for us somewhere.
C is no exception:
a <TT>qsort</TT> function is a required part of its standard library.
For the most part,
the only people who have to write sort routines
are programming students
and the few people who get stuck implementing system functions.)
</p><p>The <TT>main</TT> program at the bottom of page 108 looks a 
bit more elaborate than the pseudocode at the top of the page,
but the essence of the program is the three calls to 
<TT>readlines</TT>, <TT>qsort</TT>, and <TT>writelines</TT>.
Everything else is declarations,
plus an error message which is printed
if <TT>readlines</TT> is for some reason not able to read the input.
Eventually, you should be able to understand
why all of the
various
declarations are required,
but you can skim over them at first.
</p><p>page 109
</p><p>The <TT>readlines</TT> function
first calls our old friend <TT>getline</TT>
to read each line into a local array, <TT>line</TT>.
On page 29 in section 1.9,
we saw a program for finding the longest line in the input:
it read each line into a local array <TT>line</TT>,
and kept a copy of the longest line in a second array <TT>longest</TT>.
In that program,
it didn't matter that the input array <TT>line</TT>
was continually overwritten with each new input line,
and that most lines
(except the longest one)
were lost and forgotten.
Here, however,
we <em>do</em> need to save <em>all</em> of the input lines somewhere,
so that we can sort them and print them later.
</p><p>The lines are saved by calling <TT>alloc</TT>,
a function which we wrote in section 5.4
but may have skimmed over.
<TT>alloc</TT> allocates <TT>n</TT> bytes of new memory
for something which we need to save.
Each time we read another line,
we call <TT>alloc</TT> to allocate some new memory to store it,
then call <TT>strcpy</TT> to copy the line from the 
<TT>line</TT> array to the newly allocated memory.
This way,
it's okay
that the next line is read into the same <TT>line</TT> array;
we save each line,
as it's read,
into its own little <TT>alloc</TT>'ed piece of memory.
</p><p>Note that memory allocated with a routine such as <TT>alloc</TT>
persists,
just as global and <TT>static</TT> variables do;
it does not disappear when the function that allocated it returns.
</p><p>Hopefully you're getting used to reading compressed condition statements by now,
because here's another doozy:
<pre>	if (nlines &gt;= maxlines || (p == alloc(len)) == NULL)
</pre>This line checks to make sure we have enough room to store the 
new line we just read.
We need two things:
(1) a slot in the <TT>lineptr</TT> array to store the pointer,
and
(2)
space allocated by <TT>alloc</TT> to store the line itself.
If we don't have either of these things,
we return -1,
indicating that we ran out of memory.
We don't have a slot in the <TT>lineptr</TT> array if
we've already read <TT>maxlines</TT> lines,
and we don't have room to store the line itself
if <TT>alloc</TT> returns <TT>NULL</TT>.
The subexpression <TT>(p = alloc(len)) == NULL</TT>
is equivalent in form
to other assign-and-test combinations we've been using
involving <TT>getchar</TT> and <TT>getline</TT>:
it assigns <TT>alloc</TT>'s return value to <TT>p</TT>,
then compares it to <TT>NULL</TT>.
</p><p>Normally, we might be suspicious of the call <TT>alloc(len)</TT>.
Why?
Remember that strings are always terminated by <TT>'\0'</TT>,
so the space required to store a string
is always one more than the number of characters in it.
Normally, we'll call things like <TT>alloc(len + 1)</TT>,
and accidentally calling <TT>alloc(len)</TT> is usually a bug.
Here, it happens to be okay,
because before we copy the line to the newly-allocated memory,
we strip the newline <TT>'\n'</TT> from the end of it,
by overwriting it with <TT>'\0'</TT>, hence making the string one 
shorter than <TT>len</TT>.
(Why is the last character in <TT>line</TT>,
namely the <TT>'\n'</TT>,
at <TT>line[len-1]</TT>, and not <TT>line[len]</TT>?)
</p><p>The fragments
<pre>	if (nlines &gt;= maxlines ...
and
	lineptr[nlines++] = p;
</pre>deserve some attention.
These represent a common way of filling in an array in C.
<TT>nlines</TT> always holds the number of lines we've read so far
(it's another <dfn>invariant</dfn>).
It starts out as 0
(we haven't read any lines yet)
and it ends up as the total number of lines we've read.
Each time we read a new line,
we store the line
(more precisely, a pointer to it)
in <TT>lineptr[nlines++]</TT>.
By using postfix <TT>++</TT>,
we store the pointer in the slot indexed by the 
<em>previous</em> value of <TT>nlines</TT>,
which is what we want, because arrays are 0-based in C.
The first time through the loop,
<TT>nlines</TT> is 0,
so we store a pointer to the first line in <TT>lineptr[0]</TT>,
and then increment <TT>nlines</TT> to 1.
If <TT>nlines</TT> ever becomes equal to <TT>maxlines</TT>,
we've filled in all the slots of the array,
and we can't use any more
(even though, at that point,
the highest-filled cell in the array is <TT>lineptr[maxlines-1]</TT>,
which is the last cell in the array,
again because arrays are 0-based).
We test for this condition by checking <TT>nlines &gt;= maxlines</TT>,
as a little measure of paranoia.
The test <TT>nlines == maxlines</TT> would also work,
but if we ever accidentally introduce a bug into the program 
such that we fill past the last slot without noticing it,
we wouldn't want to keep on filling farther and farther past the end.
<br></p><p>Deep sentences:
<blockquote>...<TT>lineptr</TT> is an array of <TT>MAXLINES</TT> elements,
each element of which is a pointer to a <TT>char</TT>.
That is,
<TT>lineptr[i]</TT> is a character pointer...
</blockquote>We can see that <TT>lineptr[i]</TT> has to be a character pointer,
by looking at two things:
in the function <TT>readlines</TT>,
the line
<pre>	lineptr[lines++] = p;
</pre>has a character pointer on the right-hand side,
and the only thing we can assign a character pointer to
is another character pointer.
Also,
in
the function <TT>writelines</TT>,
in the line
<pre>	printf("%s\n", lineptr[i]);
</pre><TT>printf</TT>'s <TT>%s</TT> format expects a pointer to a character,
so that's what <TT>lineptr[i]</TT> had better be.
</p><p>Note that <TT>writelines</TT> prints a newline after each line,
since newlines were stripped out of the input lines by <TT>readlines</TT>.
</p><p>Don't worry too much about the discussion at the bottom of page 109.
We saw in section 5.3
that due to the ``strong relationship'' between pointers and arrays,
it is always possible to manipulate an array using pointer-like notation,
and to manipulate a pointer using array-like notation.
Since <TT>lineptr</TT> is an array,
it is possible to manipulate 
it using pointer-like notation,
but since what it's an array of is other pointers,
it can start to get a bit confusing.
Though many programmers do write things like
<pre>	printf("%s\n", *lineptr++);
</pre>and though this is correct code,
and though one should probably understand it
to have a 100% complete understanding of C,
I've decided that code like that is just a bit too hard
to follow,
and I'd always write
(perhaps more pedestrian and mundane)
things like
<pre>	printf("%s\n", lineptr[i]);
or
	printf("%s\n", lineptr[i++]);
</pre></p><p>page 110
</p><p>Since I didn't ask you to follow the <TT>qsort</TT> example in 
section 4.10 in complete detail, I won't ask you to work 
through this one completely, either.
But if you compare the code here to the code on pages 87-88,
you will see that the <em>only</em> significant differences are 
that the variables and arrays containing the things being 
sorted have been changed from <TT>int</TT> to <TT>char *</TT>
(pointer-to-<TT>char</TT>),
and the comparison
<pre>	if (v[i] &lt; v[left])
</pre>has been changed to
<pre>	if (strcmp(v[i], v[left]) &lt; 0)
</pre></p><hr>
