<H2>section 7.8.3: Ungetc</H2>

<p>There's not much more to say about <TT>ungetc</TT>,
but two more stdio functions which
might
deserve mention are 
<TT>fread</TT> and <TT>fwrite</TT>.
</p><p><TT>getc</TT> and <TT>putc</TT>
(and <TT>getchar</TT> and <TT>putchar</TT>)
allow you to read and write a character at a time,
while
<TT>fgets</TT> and <TT>fputs</TT> read and write a line at a time.
The <TT>printf</TT> family of routines does formatted output,
and the <TT>scanf</TT> family does formatted input.
But what if you want to read or write a big block of 
unformatted characters, not necessarily one line long?
You could use <TT>getc</TT> or <TT>putc</TT> in a loop,
but another solution is to use
the <TT>fread</TT> and <TT>fwrite</TT> functions,
which are
(briefly) described in appendix B1.5 on page 247.
