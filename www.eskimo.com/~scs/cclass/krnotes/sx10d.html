<H2>section 7.4: Formatted Input -- Scanf</H2>

page 157
<p>Somehow we've managed to make it through six chapters
without meeting <TT>scanf</TT>,
which it turns out is just as well.
</p><p>In the examples in this book so far,
all input
(from the user, or otherwise)
has been done with <TT>getchar</TT> or <TT>getline</TT>.
If we needed to input a number, we did things like
<pre>	char line[MAXLINE];
	int number;
	getline(line, MAXLINE);
	number = atoi(line);
</pre>Using <TT>scanf</TT>,
we could ``simplify'' this to
<pre>	int number;
	scanf("%d", &amp;number);
</pre>This simplification is convenient and superficially attractive,
and it works, as far as it goes.
The problem is that <TT>scanf</TT> does not work well in more 
complicated situations.
In section 7.1,
we said that
calls to <TT>putchar</TT> and <TT>printf</TT> could be interleaved.
The same is <em>not</em> always true of <TT>scanf</TT>:
you can have baffling problems
if you try to intermix calls to <TT>scanf</TT>
with calls to <TT>getchar</TT> or <TT>getline</TT>.
Worse,
it turns out that <TT>scanf</TT>'s error handling
is inadequate for many purposes.
It tells you whether a conversion succeeded or not
(more precisely, it tells you how many conversions succeeded),
but it doesn't tell you anything more than that
(unless you ask very carefully).
Like <TT>atoi</TT> and <TT>atof</TT>,
<TT>scanf</TT> stops reading characters
when it's processing a <TT>%d</TT> or <TT>%f</TT> input
and it finds a non-numeric character.
Suppose you've prompted the user to enter a number,
and the user accidentally types the letter `x'.
<TT>scanf</TT> might return 0, indicating that it couldn't 
convert a number,
but the unconvertable text (the `x')
remains on the input stream
unless you figure out some other way to remove it.
</p><p>For these reasons
(and several others, which I won't bother to mention)
it's generally recommended that <TT>scanf</TT> not be used
for unstructured input such as user prompts.
It's much better to read entire lines with something like 
<TT>getline</TT>
(as we've been doing all along)
and then process the line somehow.
If the line is supposed to be a single number,
you can use <TT>atoi</TT> or <TT>atof</TT> to convert it.
If the line has more complicated structure,
you can use <TT>sscanf</TT>
(which we'll meet in a minute)
to parse it.
(It's better to use <TT>sscanf</TT> than <TT>scanf</TT>
because when <TT>sscanf</TT> fails,
you have complete control over what you do next.
When <TT>scanf</TT> fails,
on the other hand,
you're at the mercy of where in the input stream it has left you.)
</p><p>With that little diatribe against <TT>scanf</TT> out of the way,
here are a few comments on individual points made in section 7.4.
</p><p>We've met a few functions
(e.g. <TT>getline</TT>,
<TT>month_day</TT> in section 5.7 on page 111)
which return more than one value;
the way they do so is to accept a pointer argument that tells them where
(in the caller)
to write the returned value.
<TT>scanf</TT> is the epitome of such functions:
it returns potentially many values
(one for each <TT>%</TT>-specifier in its format string),
and for each value converted and returned,
it needs a pointer argument.
</p><p>The statement on page 157 that
``blanks or tabs'' in the format string ``are ignored''
(which is repeated on page 159)
is a simplification:
in actuality,
a blank or tab
(or newline; actually any whitespace)
in the format string causes <TT>scanf</TT> to skip whitespace
(blanks, tabs, etc.)
in the input stream.
</p><p>A <TT>*</TT> character in a <TT>scanf</TT> conversion specifier
means something completely different than it does for <TT>printf</TT>:
for <TT>scanf</TT>,
it means to suppress assignment
(i.e. for that conversion specifier,
there isn't a pointer in the argument list to receive the converted value,
so the converted value is discarded).
With <TT>scanf</TT>,
there is no direct way of taking a field width from the argument list,
as <TT>*</TT> does for <TT>printf</TT>.
</p><p>Conversion specifiers like <TT>%d</TT> and <TT>%f</TT>
automatically skip leading whitespace
while looking for something to convert.
This means that the format strings <TT>"%d&nbsp;%d"</TT> and <TT>"%d%d"</TT>
act exactly the same--the
whitespace in the first format string
causes whitespace to be skipped before the second <TT>%d</TT>,
but the second <TT>%d</TT> would have skipped that whitespace anyway.
(Yet another <TT>scanf</TT> foible
is that the innocuous-looking format string <TT>"%d\n"</TT>
converts a number and then skips whitespace,
which means that it will gobble up
not only a newline following the number it converts,
but any number of newlines or whitespace,
and
in fact
it will <em>keep</em> reading
until it finds a non-whitespace character,
which it then won't read.
This sounds confusing,
but so is <TT>scanf</TT>'s behavior
when given a format string like <TT>"%d\n"</TT>.
The moral is simple:
don't use trailing <TT>\n</TT>'s in <TT>scanf</TT> format strings.)
</p><p>page 158
</p><p>Notice that,
for <TT>scanf</TT>,
the <TT>%e</TT>, <TT>%f</TT>, and <TT>%g</TT> formats
are all the same,
and signify conversion of a <TT>float</TT> value
(they accept a pointer argument of type <TT>float *</TT>).
To convert a <TT>double</TT>,
you need to use <TT>%le</TT>, <TT>%lf</TT>, or <TT>%lg</TT>.
(This is quite different from the <TT>printf</TT> family,
which uses <TT>%e</TT>, <TT>%f</TT>, and <TT>%g</TT>
for <TT>float</TT>s <em>and</em> <TT>double</TT>s,
though all three request different formats.
Furthermore,
<TT>%le</TT>, <TT>%lf</TT>, and <TT>%lg</TT>
are technically incorrect for <TT>printf</TT>,
though most compilers

probably accept them.)
</p><p>page 159
</p><p>More precisely,
the reason that you don't need to use a <TT>&amp;</TT> with <TT>monthname</TT>
is that an array,
when it appears in an expression like this,
is automatically converted to a pointer.
</p><p>The dual-format date conversion example in the middle of page 159
is a nice example of the advantages of calling 
<TT>getline</TT> and then <TT>sscanf</TT>.
At the beginning of this section,
I said that
``when <TT>sscanf</TT> fails,
you have complete control over what you do next.''
Here, ``what you do next''
is try calling <TT>sscanf</TT> again,
on the very same input string
(thus effectively backing up to the very beginning of it),
using a different format string,
to try parsing the input a different way.
