<H2>section 4.10: Recursion</H2>

page 86
<p>Recursion is a simple but deep concept
which is occasionally presented somewhat bewilderingly.
Please don't be put off by it.
If this section stops making sense,
don't worry about it;
we'll revisit recursion in chapter 6.
</p><p>Earlier we said that a function is
(or ought to be)
a ``black box''
which does some job and does it well.
Whenever you need to get that job done,
you're supposed to be able to call that function.
You're not supposed to have to worry about any reasons why the 
function might not be able to do that job for you just now.
</p><p>It turns out that some functions
are naturally written in such a way
that they can do their job
by <em>calling themselves</em> to do part of their job.
This seems like a crazy idea at first,
but based on a strict interpretation of our observation about
functions--that
we ought to be able to call them whenever we need their job
done--calling
a function from within itself ought not to be illegal,
and in fact in C it is legal.
Such a call is called a <dfn>recursive</dfn> call,
and it works because it's possible
to have several instances of a function active simultaneously.
They don't interfere with each other,
because each instance has its own copies of its parameters and local variables.
(However,
if a function accesses any static or global data,
it must be written carefully if it is to be called recursively,
because then different instances of it
<em>could</em> interfere with each other.)
</p><p>Let's consider the <TT>printd</TT> example rather carefully.
First,
remind yourself about the reverse-order problem from the 
<TT>itoa</TT> example on page 64 in section 3.6.
The ``obvious'' algorithm for determining the digits in a number,
which involves successively dividing it by 10 and looking at 
the remainders,
generates digits in right-to-left order,
but we'd usually like them in left-to-right order,
especially if we're printing them out as we go.
Let's see if we can figure out another way to do it.
</p><p>It's easy to find the lowest (rightmost) digit;
that's <TT>n % 10</TT>.
It's easy to compute
all but
the lowest digit;
that's <TT>n / 10</TT>.
So we could print a number left-to-right,
directly,
without any explicit reversal step,
if we had a routine to print all but the last digit.
We could call that routine,
then print the last digit ourselves.
</p><p>But--here's the surprise--the routine to
``print all but the last digit''
is <TT>printd</TT>,
the routine we're writing,
if we call it with an argument of <TT>n / 10</TT>.
</p><p>Recursion seems like cheating--it seems that if you're 
writing a routine to do something
(in this case,
to print digits)
and instead of writing code to print digits
you just punt and call a routine for printing digits
and which is in fact the very routine you're supposed to 
write--it seems like you haven't done the job you came to do.
A recursive function seems like circular reasoning;
it seems to beg the question of how it does its job.
</p><p>But if you're writing a recursive function,
as long as you do a little bit of work yourself,
and only pass on a portion of the job to another instance of yourself,
you haven't completely reneged on your responsibilities.
Furthermore,
if you're ever called with such a small job to do
that the little bit you're willing to do encompasses the whole job,
you don't have to call yourself again
(there's no remaining portion that you can't do).
Finally,
since each recursive call does some work,
passing on smaller and smaller portions to succeeding recursive calls,
and since the last call
(where the remaining portion is empty)
doesn't generate any more recursive calls,
the recursion is broken
and doesn't constitute an infinite loop.
</p><p>Don't worry about the quicksort example
if it seems impenetrable--quicksort is an important algorithm,
but it
is not easy
to understand completely at first.
<br></p><p>Note that the <TT>qsort</TT> routine described here is very different 
from the standard library <TT>qsort</TT>
(in fact, it probably shouldn't even have the same name).
