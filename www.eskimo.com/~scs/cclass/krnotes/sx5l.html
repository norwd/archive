<H2>section 2.12: Precedence and Order of Evaluation</H2>

<p>Note that precedence is <em>not</em> the same thing as order of evaluation.
Precedence determines how an expression is parsed,
and it has an influence on the order in which parts of it are 
evaluated,
but the influence isn't as strong as you'd think.
Precedence says that in the expression
<pre>	1 + 2 * 3
</pre>the multiplication happens
before the addition.
But if we have several function calls,
such as
<pre>	f() + g() * h()
</pre>we have no idea which function will be called first;
the compiler might arrange to call <TT>f()</TT> first even
though its value won't be needed until last.
If we were to write an abomination like
<pre>	i = 1;
	a[i++] + a[i++] * a[i++]
</pre>we would have <em>no</em> way of knowing which order the three 
increments would happen in,
and in fact the compiler wouldn't have any idea either.
We could <em>not</em> argue that since multiplication has 
higher precedence than addition, and since multiplication 
associates from left to right, the second <TT>i++</TT> would have to 
happen first, then the third, then the first.
(Actually, associativity <em>never</em> says anything about 
which side of a single binary operator gets evaluated first;
associativity says which of several adjacent same-precedence 
operators happens first.)
</p><p>In general,
you should be wary of ever trying to
second-guess the relative order
in which the various parts of an expression will be evaluated,
with two exceptions:
<OL><li>You can obviously assume that precedence will dictate
the order in
which binary operators
are applied.
This typically says more than just what order things happens in,
but also what the expression actually <em>means</em>.
(In other words,
the precedence of <TT>*</TT> over <TT>+</TT>
says more than that the multiplication ``happens first''
in <TT>1 + 2 * 3</TT>;
it says that the answer is 7, not 9.)
<li>You can assume that the <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> and <TT>||</TT> operators
are evaluated left-to-right,
and that the right-hand side is not evaluated at all
if the left-hand side determines the outcome.
</OL></p><p>To look at one more example,
it might seem that the code
<pre>	int i = 7;
	printf("%d\n", i++ * i++);
</pre>would have to print 56, because no matter which order the
increments happen in, 7x8 is 8x7 is 56.
But <TT>++</TT> just says that the increment happens later,
not that it happens immediately,
so this code could print 49
(if it chose to perform the multiplication first,
and both increments later).
And,
it turns out that ambiguous expressions like this are such a
bad idea that the ANSI C Standard does not require compilers to
do anything reasonable with them at all,
such that
the above code
might end up
printing 42, or 8923409342, or 0, or crashing
your computer.
</p><p>Finally,
note that parentheses don't dictate overall evaluation
order any more than precedence does.
Parentheses override precedence
and say which operands go with which operators,
and they therefore affect the overall meaning of an expression,
but they don't
say anything about the order of subexpressions or side effects.
We could not ``fix''
the evaluation order of
any of the
expressions we've been discussing
by adding parentheses.
If we wrote
<pre>	f() + (g() * h())
</pre>we still wouldn't know whether
<TT>f()</TT>, <TT>g()</TT>, or <TT>h()</TT>
would be called first.
(The parentheses would force the multiplication to happen before the addition,
but precedence already would have forced that, anyway.)
If we wrote
<pre>	(i++) * (i++)
</pre>the parentheses wouldn't force the increments to happen before
the multiplication or in any well-defined order;
this parenthesized version would be just as undefined as
<TT>i++ * i++</TT> was.
</p><p>page 53
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>Function calls,
nested assignment statements,
and increment and decrement operators cause
``side effects''--some
variable is changed as a by-product of the evaluation of an expression.
</blockquote>(There's a slight inaccuracy in this sentence:
<em>any</em> assignment expression counts as a side effect.)
</p><p>It's these ``side effects'' that you want to keep in 
mind when you're making sure that your programs are well-defined
and don't suffer any of the undefined behavior we've been 
discussing.
(When we informally said that
complex expressions had several things going on ``at once,''
we were actually referring to expressions with multiple side effects.)
As a general rule,
you should make sure that each expression only has one side effect,
or if it has several,
that <em>different</em> variables are changed by the several side effects.
</p><p>page 54
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>The moral is that writing code
that depends on order of evaluation
is a bad programming practice in any language.
Naturally,
it is necessary to know what things to avoid,
but if you don't know
<I>how</I>
they are done on various machines,
you won't be tempted to take advantage of a particular implementation.
</blockquote></p><p>The first edition of K&amp;R said
<blockquote>...if you don't know
<I>how</I>
they are done on various machines,
that innocence may help to protect you.
</blockquote>I actually prefer the first edition wording.
Many textbooks encourage you to write small programs
to find out how your compiler
implements some of these ambiguous expressions,
but it's
just
one step from writing a small program to find out,
to writing a real program which makes use of what you've just learned.
And
you <em>don't</em> want to write programs
that work only under one particular compiler,
that take advantage of the way that compiler
(but perhaps no other)
happens to implement the undefined expressions.
It's fine to be curious about what goes on ``under the hood,''
and many of you will be curious enough about what's going on 
with these ``forbidden'' expressions that you'll want to 
investigate them,
but please keep very firmly in mind that,
for real programs,
the very easiest way of dealing with ambiguous, undefined expressions
(which one compiler interprets one way
and another interprets another way
and a third crashes on)
is not to write them in the first place.
