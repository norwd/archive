<H2>section 5.1: Pointers and Addresses</H2>

<p>If you like to use concrete examples
and to think about exactly what's going on at the machine level,
you'll want to know how many bytes are occupied by
<TT>short</TT>s, <TT>long</TT>s, pointers, etc.
It's equally possible, though,
to understand pointers at a more abstract level,
thinking about them only in terms of boxes and arrows,
as in the figures on pages 96, 98, 104, 107, and 114-5.
(Not worrying about the exact size in bytes basically means not 
worrying about how big the boxes are.)
The figure at the bottom of page 93
is probably the least pretty pointer picture in the whole book;
don't worry if it doesn't mean much to you.
</p><p>When we say that a pointer holds an ``address,''
and that unary <TT>&amp;</TT> is the ``address of'' operator,
our language is of course influenced by the fact that the 
underlying hardware assigns addresses to memory locations,
but again,
it is not necessary
(nor necessarily desirable)
to think about actual machine addresses when working with pointers.
Thinking about the machine addresses
can make certain aspects of pointers easier to understand,
but doing so can also make certain mistakes and misunderstandings easier.
In particular,

a pointer in C is more than just an address;
as we'll see on the next page,
a pointer also carries the notion of what <em>type</em> of data it points to.
</p><p>page 94
</p><p>The presentation on this page is going to seem very artificial at first.
At best, you're going to say,
``This makes sense, but what's it <em>for</em>?''
In fact,
it <em>is</em> artificial,
and no real program would ever do meaningless little pointer operations
such as are embodied in the example on this page.
However,
this is the traditional way to introduce pointers from scratch,
and once we've moved past it,
we'll be able to talk about some more meaningful uses of pointers,
and to forget about these artificial ones.
(Once we're done talking about
the traditional, artificial introduction on page 94,
we'll also attempt a slightly more elaborate,
slightly less traditional,
slightly more meaningful
parallel introduction,
so stay tuned.)
</p><p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>The declaration of the pointer <TT>ip</TT>,
<pre>	int *ip;
</pre>is intended as a mnemonic;
it says that the expression <TT>*ip</TT> is an <TT>int</TT>.
</blockquote>We'll have more to say about this sentence in a bit.
</p><p>As an even more traditional,
even less meaningful,
even simpler example,
we could say
<pre>	int i = 1;		/* an integer */
	int *ip;		/* a pointer-to-int */
	ip = &amp;i;		/* ip points to i */
	printf("%d\n", *ip);	/* prints i, which is 1 */
	*ip = 5;		/* sets i to 5 */
</pre>(The obvious questions are,
``if you want to print <TT>i</TT>,
or set it to 5,
why not just <em>do</em> it?
Why mess around with this `pointer' thing?''
More on that in a minute.)
</p><p>The unary <TT>&amp;</TT> and <TT>*</TT> operators are complementary.
Given an object (i.e. a variable),
<TT>&amp;</TT> generates a pointer to it;
given a pointer, <TT>*</TT> ``returns'' the value of the pointed-to object.
``Returns'' is in quotes because,
as you may have noticed in the examples,
you're not restricted to fetching values via pointers:
you can also store values via pointers.
In an assignment like
<pre>	*ip = 0;
</pre>the subexpression <TT>*ip</TT> is conceptually
``replaced'' by the object which <TT>ip</TT> points to,
and since <TT>*ip</TT> appears on the left-hand side of the 
assignment operator,
what happens to the pointed-to object is that it gets assigned to.
</p><p>One of the things that's hard about pointers is simply talking 
about what's going on.
We've been using the words ``return'' and ``replace'' in quotes,
because they don't quite reflect what's actually going on,
and we've been using clumsy locutions like
``fetch via pointers'' and ``store via pointers.''
There is some jargon for referring to pointer use;
one word you'll often see is <dfn>dereference</dfn>,
a term which,
though its derivation is suspect,
is used to mean
``follow a pointer to get at, and use, the object it points to.''
Thus, we sometimes call unary <TT>*</TT>
the ``pointer dereferencing operator,''
and we may say that the expressions
<pre>	printf("%d\n", *ip);
</pre>and
<pre>	*ip = 5;
</pre>both ``dereference the pointer <TT>ip</TT>.''
We may also talk about <dfn>indirecting</dfn> on a pointer:
to <dfn>indirect</dfn> on a pointer
is again to follow it to see what it points to;
and <TT>*</TT> may also be called the ``pointer indirection operator.''
</p><p>Our examples of pointers so far have been,
admittedly,
artificial and rather meaningless.
Let's try a slightly more realistic example.
In the previous chapter,
we used the routines <TT>atoi</TT> and <TT>atof</TT>
to convert strings representing numbers to the actual numbers represented.
Often the strings were typed by the user,
and read with <TT>getline</TT>.
As you may have noticed,
neither <TT>atoi</TT> nor <TT>atof</TT> does any validity or error checking:
both simply stop reading
when they reach a character
that can't be part of the number they're converting,
and if there aren't <em>any</em> numeric characters in the string,
they simply return 0.
(For example, <TT>atoi("49er")</TT> is 49,
and <TT>atoi("three")</TT> is 0,
and <TT>atof("1.2.3")</TT> is 1.2
.)
These attributes make <TT>atoi</TT> and <TT>atof</TT>
easy to write and easy
(for the programmer)
to use,
but they are not the most user-friendly routines possible.
A good user interface would warn the user
and prompt again
in case of invalid, non-numeric input.
</p><p>Suppose we were writing a simple inventory-control system.
For each part stored in our warehouse,
we might record the part number,
location,
and number of parts on hand.
For simplicity,
we'll assume that the location is always a simple bin number.
</p><p>Somewhere in the inventory-control program,
we might find the variables
<pre>	int part_number;
	int location;
	int number_on_hand;
</pre>and there might be a routine that lets the user enter any of these numbers.
Suppose that there is another variable,
<pre>	int which_entry;
</pre>which indicates which of the three numbers is being entered
(1 for <TT>part_number</TT>,
2 for <TT>location</TT>,
or 3 for <TT>number_on_hand</TT>).
We might have code like this:
<pre>	char instring[30];
<br>
<br>
	switch (which_entry) {
	case 1:
		printf("enter part number:\n");
		getline(instring, 30);
		part_number = atoi(instring);
		break;
<br>
<br>
	case 2:
		printf("enter location:\n");
		getline(instring, 30);
		location = atoi(instring);
		break;
<br>
<br>
	case 3:
		printf("enter number on hand:\n");
		getline(instring, 30);
		number_on_hand = atoi(instring);
		break;
	}
</pre>Suppose that we now begin to add
a bit of rudimentary verification to the input routines.
The first case might look like
<pre>	case 1:
		do {
			printf("enter part number:\n");
			getline(instring, 30);
			if(!isdigit(instring[0]))
				continue;
			part_number = atoi(instring);
		} while (part_number == 0);
		break;
</pre>If the first character is not a digit,
or if <TT>atoi</TT> returns 0,
the code
goes around the loop another time,
and prompts the user again,
in hopes that the user will type some proper numeric input this time.
(The
tests
for numeric input
are not sufficient,
nor even wise if 0 is a possible input value,
as it presumably is for number on hand.
In fact, the two tests really do the same thing!
But please overlook these faults.
If you're curious,
you can learn about a new ANSI function, <TT>strtol</TT>,
which is like <TT>atoi</TT> but gives you a bit more control,
and would be a better routine to use here.)
</p><p>The code fragment above is for just one of the three input cases.
The obvious way to perform the same checking
for the other two cases
would be to repeat the same code two more times,
changing the prompt string
and the name of the variable assigned to
(<TT>location</TT> or <TT>number_on_hand</TT> instead of <TT>part_number</TT>).
Duplicating the code is a nuisance,
though,
especially if we later come up with a better way to do input verification
(perhaps one not suffering from the imperfections mentioned above).
Is there a better way?
</p><p>One way would be to use a temporary variable in the input loop,
and then set one of the three real variables
to the value of the temporary variable,
depending on <TT>which_entry</TT>:
<pre>	int temp;
<br>
<br>
	do {
		printf("enter the number:\n");
		getline(instring, 30);
		if(!isdigit(instring[0]))
			continue;
		temp = atoi(instring);
	} while (temp == 0);
<br>
<br>
	switch (which_entry) {
	case 1:
		part_number = temp;
		break;
<br>
<br>
	case 2:
		location = temp;
		break;
<br>
<br>
	case 3:
		number_on_hand = temp;
		break;
	}
</pre></p><p>Another way, however,
would be to use a <em>pointer</em>
to keep track of which variable we're setting.
(In this example, we'll also get the prompt right.)
<pre>	char instring[30];
	int *numpointer;
	char *prompt;
<br>
<br>
	switch (which_entry) {
	case 1:
		numpointer = &amp;part_number;
		prompt = "part number";
		break;
<br>
<br>
	case 2:
		numpointer = &amp;location;
		prompt = "location";
		break;
<br>
<br>
	case 3:
		numpointer = &amp;number_on_hand;
		prompt = "number on hand";
		break;
	}
<br>
<br>
	do {
		printf("enter %s:\n", prompt);
		getline(instring, 30);
		if(!isdigit(instring[0]))
			continue;
		*numpointer = atoi(instring);
	} while (*numpointer == 0);
</pre>The idea here is that
<TT>prompt</TT> is the prompt string
and
<TT>numpointer</TT> points to the 
particular numeric value we're entering.
That way, a single input verification loop can
print any of the three prompts
and
set any of the 
three numeric variables,
depending on where <TT>numpointer</TT> points.
(We
won't officially see
character pointers and strings until section 5.5,
so don't worry if
the use of the <TT>prompt</TT> pointer seems
new or inexplicable.)
</p><p>This example is, in its own ways, quite artificial.
(In a real inventory-control program,
we'd obviously need to keep track of many parts;
we couldn't use single variables for the part number, location, and quantity.
We probably wouldn't really have a <TT>which_entry</TT> variable
telling us which number to prompt for,
and we'd do the numeric validation quite differently.
We might well do numeric entry and validation in a separate function,
removing this need for the pointers.)
However,
the pointer aspect of this
example--using
a pointer to refer to one of several different things,
so that one generic piece of code can access any of the 
things--is
a very typical
(i.e. realistic)
use of pointers.
</p><p>There's one nuance of pointer declarations which deserves mention.
We've seen that
<pre>	int *ip;
</pre>declares the variable <TT>ip</TT> as a pointer to an <TT>int</TT>.
We might look at that declaration and imagine that 
<TT>int *</TT> is the type
and <TT>ip</TT> is the name of the variable being declared.
(Actually, so far, these assumptions are both true.)
We might therefore imagine that a more ``obvious'' way of writing 
the declaration would be
<pre>	int* ip;
</pre>This would work,
but it is misleading,
as we'll see if we try to declare two <TT>int</TT> pointers at once.
How shall we do it?
If we try
<pre>	int* ip1, ip2;		/* WRONG */
</pre>we don't succeed;
this would declare <TT>ip1</TT> as a pointer-to-<TT>int</TT>,
but <TT>ip2</TT> as an <TT>int</TT>
(not a pointer).
The correct declaration for two pointers is
<pre>	int *ip1, *ip2;
</pre>As the authors said in the middle of page 94,
the intent of pointer
(and in fact all)
declarations is that they give little miniature expressions
indicating what type
a certain use
of the variables
will have.
The declaration
<pre>	int *ip1;
</pre>doesn't so much say that <TT>ip</TT> is a pointer-to-<TT>int</TT>;
it says that <TT>*ip</TT> is an <TT>int</TT>.
(To be sure, <TT>ip</TT> <em>is</em> a pointer-to-<TT>int</TT>.)
In the declaration
<pre>	int *ip1, *ip2;
</pre>both <TT>*ip1</TT> and <TT>*ip2</TT> are <TT>int</TT>s;
so <TT>ip1</TT> and <TT>ip2</TT> are both pointers-to-<TT>int</TT>.
You'll hear this aspect of C declarations referred to as
``declaration mimics use.''
If it bothers you,
or if you think you might accidentally write things like
<pre>	int *ip1, ip2;
</pre>then
to stay on the safe side
you might want to get in the habit of writing declarations
on separate lines:
<pre>	int *ip1;
	int *ip2;
</pre></p><p>I promised to point out the safe techniques for ensuring that 
pointers always point where they should.
The examples in this section,
which have all involved pointers pointing to single variables,
are relatively safe;
a single variable is not a very risky thing to point to,
so code like the examples in this section is relatively 
unlikely to go awry and result in invalid pointers.
(One potential problem, though,
which we'll talk more about later,

is that since local, ``automatic'' variables
are automatically deallocated when the function containing them returns,
any pointer to a local variable also becomes invalid.
Therefore, a function which returns a pointer
must never return a pointer to one of its own local variables,
and it would also be invalid to take
a pointer to a local variable
and assign it
to a global pointer variable.)
