<H2>section 4.11.3: Conditional Inclusion</H2>

page 91
<p>The <TT>#if !defined(HDR)</TT> trick is a bit esoteric to start out with.
Let's look at a simpler example:
in ANSI C,
the <TT>remove</TT> function deletes a file.
On some older Unix systems, however,
the function to delete a file is instead named <TT>unlink</TT>.
Therefore, when deleting a file,
we might use code like this:
<pre>	#if defined(unix)
		unlink(filename);
	#else
		remove(filename);
	#endif
</pre>We would arrange to have the macro <TT>unix</TT>
defined
when we were compiling our program on a Unix machine,
and not otherwise.
</p><p>You may wonder what the difference is between the <TT>if()</TT> statement
we've been using all along,
and this new <TT>#if</TT> preprocessing directive.
<TT>if()</TT> acts at run time;
it selects whether or not a statement or group of statements is executed,
based on a run-time condition.
<TT>#if</TT>, on the other hand,
acts at compile time;
it determines whether certain parts of your program
are even seen by the compiler or not.
If for some reason
you want to have two slightly different versions of your program,
you can use <TT>#if</TT> to separate the different parts,
leaving the bulk of the code common,
such that you don't have
to maintain two totally separate versions.
</p><p><TT>#if</TT> can be used to conditionally compile anything:
not just statements and expressions,
but also declarations and entire functions.
</p><p>Back to the <TT>HDR</TT> example
(though this is somewhat of a tangent,
and it's not vital for you to follow it):
it's possible for the same header file
to be <TT>#include</TT>d twice during one compilation,
either because the same <TT>#include</TT> line appears twice 
within the same source file,
or because a source file contains something like
<pre>	#include "a.h"
	#include "b.h"
</pre>but <TT>b.h</TT> also <TT>#include</TT>s <TT>a.h</TT>.
Since some declarations
which you might put in header files
would cause errors
if they were acted on twice,
the <TT>#if !defined(HDR)</TT> trick
arranges that the contents of a header file are only processed once.
</p><p>Note that two different macros,
both named <TT>HDR</TT>,
are being used on page 91,
for two entirely different purposes.
At the top of the page,
<TT>HDR</TT> is a simple
on-off
switch;
it is <TT>#define</TT>d
(with no replacement text)
when <TT>hdr.h</TT> is <TT>#include</TT>d for the first time,
and any subsequent #inclusion
merely tests whether <TT>HDR</TT> is <TT>#define</TT>d.
(Note that it is
in fact
quite
possible to define a macro with no replacement text;
a macro so defined
is distinguishable from a macro which has not been <TT>#define</TT>d at all.
One common use of a macro with no replacement text
is precisely as a simple <TT>#if</TT> switch like this.)
</p><p>At the bottom of the page,
<TT>HDR</TT> ends up containing the name of a header file to be <TT>#include</TT>d;
the name depends on the <TT>#if</TT> and <TT>#elif</TT> directives.
The line
<pre>	#include HDR
</pre><TT>#include</TT>s one of them,
depending on the final value of <TT>HDR</TT>.
