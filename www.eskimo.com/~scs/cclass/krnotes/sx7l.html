<H2>section 4.11.1: File Inclusion</H2>

<p>The two syntaxes for <TT>#include</TT> lines can be used in various ways,
but very simply speaking,
<TT>""</TT> is for header files you've written,
and <TT>&lt;&gt;</TT> is for headers which are provided for you
(which someone else has written).
</p><p>page 89
</p><p>Deep sentences:
<blockquote><TT>#include</TT> is the preferred way
to tie the declarations together
for a large program.
It guarantees that all the source files will be supplied with 
the same definitions and variable declarations,
and thus eliminates a particularly nasty kind of bug.
Naturally,
when an included file is changed,
all files that depend on it must be recompiled.
</blockquote>That's the story on <TT>#include</TT>, in a nutshell.
