<H2>section 5.4: Address Arithmetic</H2>

<p>This section is going to get pretty hairy.
Some of it talks about things we've already seen
(adding integers to pointers);
some of it talks about things we need to learn
(comparing and subtracting pointers);
and some of it talks about a rather sophisticated example
(a storage allocator).
Don't worry if you can't follow all the details of the storage allocator,
but do read along so that you can pick up the other new points.
(In other words,
make sure you read from
``Zero is the sole exception''
in the middle of page 102
to
``that is, the string length''
on page 103,
and also the last paragraph on page 103.)
</p><p>What is a storage allocator for?
So far,
we've used pointers to point to existing variables and arrays,
which the compiler allocated for us.
But eventually,
we may want to allocate data structures
(arrays, and others we haven't seen yet)
of a size which we don't know at compile time.
Earlier,
we spoke briefly about a hypothetical inventory-management system,
which recorded information about each part stored in a warehouse.
How many different parts could there be?
If we used fixed-size arrays,
there would be a fixed upper limit
on the number of parts we could enter into the system,
and we'd be annoyed if that limit were reached.
A better solution is not to allocate a fixed array at compile time,
but rather to use a run-time storage allocator to allocate 
memory for the data structures used to describe each part.
That way, the number of parts which the system can hold
is limited only by available memory,
not on any static limit built into the program.
Using a storage allocator to allocate memory at run time
in this way
is called <dfn>dynamic allocation</dfn>.
</p><p>However,
dynamic memory allocation is where C programming can really get tricky,
because you the programmer are responsible for most aspects of it,
and there are plenty of things you can do wrong
(e.g. not allocate quite enough memory,
accidentally keep using it after you deallocate it,
have random invalid pointers pointing everywhere, etc.).
Therefore,
we won't be talking about dynamic allocation for a while,
which is why you can skim over the storage allocator in this section for now.
</p><p>page 102
</p><p>The first new piece of information in this section
(which you'll need to remember
even if you're not following the details of the storage allocator example)
is the introduction of the ``null pointer.''
</p><p>So far, all of our pointers have pointed somewhere,
and we've cautioned about pointers which don't.
To help us distinguish between pointers which point somewhere
and pointers which don't,
there is a single, special pointer value
we can use,
which is guaranteed 
not to point anywhere.
When a pointer doesn't point anywhere,
we can set it to this value,
to make explicit the fact that it doesn't point anywhere.
</p><p>This special pointer value is called the <dfn>null pointer</dfn>.
The way to set a pointer to this value is to use a constant 0:
<pre>	int *ip = 0;
</pre>The 0 is just a shorthand;
it does <em>not</em> necessarily mean machine address 0.
To make it clear that we're talking about the null pointer
and not the integer 0,
we often use a macro definition like
<pre>	#define NULL 0
</pre>so that we can say things like
<pre>	int *ip = NULL;
</pre>(If you've used Pascal or LISP,
the <TT>nil</TT> pointer in those languages is analogous.)
</p><p>In fact,
the above #definition of <TT>NULL</TT> has been placed in the 
standard header file <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> for us
(and in several other standard header files as well),
so we don't even need to <TT>#define</TT> it.
I agree completely with the authors
that using <TT>NULL</TT> instead of 0
makes it more clear that we're talking about a null pointer,
so I'll always be using <TT>NULL</TT>, too.
</p><p>Just as we can set a pointer to <TT>NULL</TT>,
we can also test a pointer to see if it's <TT>NULL</TT>.
The code
<pre>	if(p != NULL)
		*p = 0;
	else	printf("p doesn't point anywhere\n");
</pre>tests <TT>p</TT> to see if it's non-<TT>NULL</TT>.
If it's not <TT>NULL</TT>,
it assumes that it points somewhere valid,
and writes a 0 there.
Otherwise
(i.e. if <TT>p</TT> is the null pointer)
the code complains.
</p><p>Though we can use null pointers as markers to remind ourselves 
of which of our pointers don't point anywhere,
it's up to us to do so.
It is <em>not</em> guaranteed that all uninitialized pointer 
variables
(which obviously don't point anywhere)
are initialized to <TT>NULL</TT>,
so
if we want to use the null pointer convention to remind ourselves,
we'd best explicitly initialize all
unused
pointers to <TT>NULL</TT>.
Furthermore,
there is no general mechanism that automatically checks
whether a pointer is non-null before we use it.
If we think that a pointer might not point anywhere,
and if we're using the convention that pointers that don't 
point anywhere are set to <TT>NULL</TT>,
it's up to us to compare the pointer to <TT>NULL</TT>
to decide whether it's safe to
use
it.
</p><p>The next new piece of information in this section
(which we've already alluded to)
is pointer comparison.
You can compare two pointers for equality or inequality
(<TT>==</TT> or <TT>!=</TT>):
they're equal if they point to the same place or are both null pointers;
they're unequal if they point to different places,
or if one points somewhere and one is a null pointer.
If
two pointers point into the same array,
the relational comparisons
<TT>&lt;</TT>, <TT>&lt;=</TT>, <TT>&gt;</TT>, and <TT>&gt;=</TT>
can also be used.
</p><p>page 103
</p><p>The sentences
<blockquote>...<TT>n</TT> is scaled according to the size of the objects <TT>p</TT> points to,
which is determined by the declaration of <TT>p</TT>.
If an <TT>int</TT> is four bytes,
for example,
the <TT>int</TT> will be scaled by four.
</blockquote>say something we've seen already,
but may only confuse the issue.
We've said informally that in the code
<pre>	int a[10];
	int *pa = &amp;a[0];
	*(pa+1) = 1;
</pre><TT>pa</TT> contains the ``address'' of the <TT>int</TT> object <TT>a[0]</TT>,
but we've discouraged thinking about this address
as an actual machine memory address.
We've said that the expression <TT>pa+1</TT>
moves to the next <TT>int</TT> in the array
(in this case, <TT>a[1]</TT>).
Thinking at this abstract level,
we don't even need to worry about any
``scaling by the size of the objects pointed to.''
</p><p>If we do look at a lower, machine level of addressing,
we may learn that an <TT>int</TT> occupies some number of bytes
(usually two or four),
such that when we add 1 to a pointer-to-<TT>int</TT>,
the machine address is actually increased by 2 or 4.
If you like to consider the situation from this angle,
you're welcome to,
but if you don't,
you certainly don't have to.
If you do start thinking about machine addresses and sizes,
make extra sure that you remember that C <em>does</em> do the necessary 
scaling for you.
Don't write something like
<pre>	int a[10];
	int *pa = &amp;a[0];
	*(pa+sizeof(int)) = 1;
</pre>where <TT>sizeof(int)</TT> is the size of an <TT>int</TT> in bytes,
and expect it to access <TT>a[1]</TT>.
</p><p>Since adding an <TT>int</TT> to a pointer gives us another pointer:
<pre>	int a[10];
	int *pa1 = &amp;a[0];
	int *pa2 = pa1 + 5;
</pre>we might wonder if we can rearrange the expression
<pre>	pa2 = pa1 + 5
</pre>to get
<pre>	pa2 - pa1 &#8799; 5
</pre>(where this is no longer a C assignment,
we're just wondering if we can subtract <TT>pa1</TT> from <TT>pa2</TT>,
and what the result might be).
The answer is yes:
just as you can compare two pointers which point into the same array,
you can subtract them,
and the result is,
naturally enough,
the distance between them,
in cells or elements.
</p><p>(In the large parenthetical statement in the middle of the page,
don't worry too much about
<TT>ptrdiff_t</TT>, <TT>size_t</TT>, and <TT>sizeof</TT>.)
