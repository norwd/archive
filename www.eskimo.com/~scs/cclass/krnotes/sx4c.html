<H2>section 1.3: The For Statement</H2>

pages 13-14
<p>Deep sentence:
<blockquote>...in any context where it is
permissible to use the value of a variable of some type,
you can use a more complicated expression of that type.
</blockquote>You may have used other languages which placed restrictions on 
where you could use expressions or how complicated they could be.
C has relatively few such restrictions.
There's nothing magical about the <TT>printf</TT> call above;
this ability to perform a computation inside of an argument is
not unique to <TT>printf</TT>.
In any function call,
the arguments in the argument list are expressions,
and it doesn't matter if they are simple expressions which just
fetch the value of one variable, like <TT>fahr</TT>, or more
complicated expressions, like <TT>5.0/9.0 * (fahr - 32)</TT>.
