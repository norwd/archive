<H2>section 7.5: File Access</H2>

page 160
<p>We've come an amazingly long way without ever having to open a file
(we've been relying exclusively
on those predefined standard input and output streams)
but now it's time to take the plunge.
</p><p>The concept of a <dfn>file pointer</dfn> is an important one.
It would theoretically be possible
to mention the name of a file
each time it was desired to read from or write to it.
But such an approach would have a number of drawbacks.

Instead,
the usual approach
(and the one taken in C's stdio library)
is that you mention the name of the file once,
at the time you <dfn>open</dfn> it.
Thereafter, you use some little
token--in
this case,
the file 
pointer--which
keeps track
(both for your sake and the library's)
of which file you're talking about.
Whenever you want to
read from or write to
one of the files you're working with,
you identify that file
by using the file pointer
you obtained from <TT>fopen</TT> when you opened the file.
(It is possible to have several files open,
as long as you use distinct variables to store the file pointers.)
</p><p>Not only do you not need to know the details of a <TT>FILE</TT> structure,
you don't even need to know what the ``buffer'' is
that the structure contains the location of.
</p><p>In general, the only declaration you need for a file pointer
is the declaration of the file pointer:
<pre>	FILE *fp;
</pre>You should never need to type the line
<pre>	FILE *fopen(char *name, char *mode);
</pre>because it's provided for you in <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>.
</p><p>If you skipped section 6.7, you don't know about <TT>typedef</TT>,
but don't worry.
Just assume that <TT>FILE</TT> is a type, like <TT>int</TT>,
except one that is defined by <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> instead of 
being built into the language.
Furthermore,
note that you will never be using variables of type <TT>FILE</TT>;
you will always be using pointers to this type,
or <TT>FILE *</TT>.
</p><p>A ``binary file''
is one which is treated as an arbitrary series of byte values,
as opposed to a text file.
We won't be working with binary files,
but if you ever do, 
remember to use <TT>fopen</TT> modes
like <TT>"rb"</TT> and <TT>"wb"</TT> when opening them.
</p><p>page 161
</p><p>We won't worry too much about error handling for now,
but if you start writing production programs,
it's something you'll want to learn about.
It's extremely annoying for a program to say
``can't open file''
without saying <em>why</em>.
(Some particularly unhelpful programs
don't even tell you which file they couldn't open.)
</p><p>On this page we learn about four new functions,
<TT>getc</TT>, <TT>putc</TT>,
<TT>fprintf</TT>, and <TT>fscanf</TT>,
which are just like functions that we've already been using
except that they let you specify a file pointer
to tell them which file
(or other I/O stream)
to read from or write to.
(Note that for <TT>putc</TT>,
the extra <TT>FILE *</TT> argument comes last,
while for <TT>fprintf</TT> and <TT>fscanf</TT>,
it comes first.)
</p><p>page 162
</p><p><TT>cat</TT> is about the most basic
and important
file-handling program there is
(even if its name is a bit obscure).
The <TT>cat</TT> program on page 162 is a bit like the 
``hello, world'' program on page 6--it may seem trivial,
but if you can get it
to work,
you're over the biggest first hurdle
when it comes to handling files at all.
</p><p>Compare the <TT>cat</TT> program
(and especially its <TT>filecopy</TT> function)
to the file copying program on page 16 of
section 1.5.1--<TT>cat</TT> is essentially the same program,
except that it accepts filenames on the command line.
</p><p>Since
the authors advise calling <TT>fclose</TT> 
in part to
``flush the buffer in which <TT>putc</TT> is collecting output,''
you may wonder why 
the program at the top of the 
page does not call <TT>fclose</TT> on its output stream.
The reason can be found in the next sentence:
an implicit <TT>fclose</TT> happens automatically for any streams which 
remain open when the program exits normally.
</p><p>In general,
it's a good idea to close any streams you open,
but not to close the preopened streams
such as <TT>stdin</TT> and <TT>stdout</TT>.
(Since ``the system'' opened them for you
as your program was starting up,
it's appropriate to let it close them for you as your program exits.)
