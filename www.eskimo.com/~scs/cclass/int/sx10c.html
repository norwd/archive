<H2>24.3 Function Pointers and Prototypes</H2>

<p>It's generally a good idea to have a function prototype in scope
whenever you call a function.
Function prototypes allow the compiler to generate
correct code for function calls,
and to verify that you've called a function with the correct
number and type of arguments.
Standard library functions are prototyped
by including the relevant standard header files,
and it's generally recommended
that you write prototype declarations for your own functions, too,
usually placing
those declarations
in your own header files.
But what prototype can be used
for an indirect function call using a function pointer,
such as
<pre>
	(*pfi)(arg1, arg2)
</pre>
In general, it won't be known until run time
what function <TT>pfi</TT> actually points to,
so there's no way for the compiler to check the call
against the prototype of the actually-called function.
(We may know that <TT>pfi</TT> points to
<TT>f1</TT>, <TT>f2</TT>, or <TT>f3</TT>,
and we may have supplied prototypes for those functions,
but that's immaterial.)
</p><p>We've seen that when you declare a function pointer,
you must declare what the return value
of the pointed-to function will be.
It's also possible to specify what the prototype
of the pointed-to function will be.
Here's our earlier declaration of <TT>pfi</TT>,
beefed up with a prototype for the arguments:
<pre>
	int (*pfi)(int, int);
</pre>
Now we know that <TT>pfi</TT> is a pointer to a function,
that the function (whatever it is) accepts two <TT>int</TT> arguments,
and that the function returns an <TT>int</TT>.
Having specified this,
the compiler will now be able to do some more checking for us.
If we call
<pre>
	(*pfi)(1, 2, 3)
</pre>
the compiler will complain,
because it knows that the function pointed to by <TT>pfi</TT>
is supposed to receive
two arguments,
but we've passed three.
The compiler is also in a position to verify
that we actually <em>set</em> <TT>pfi</TT>
to point to functions that accept two <TT>int</TT> arguments.
Our examples so far were in terms of functions which we declared as
<pre>
	extern int f1();
	extern int f2();
	extern int f3();
</pre>
that is, as functions taking unspecified arguments and returning <TT>int</TT>.
(Remember, empty parentheses in an external function declaration indicate
that the function accepts
unspecified arguments,
while empty parentheses in a function definition
indicate that the function accepts no arguments.)
So the compiler won't be able to check the assignments
unless we also provide prototypes:
<pre>
	extern int f1(int, int);
	extern int f2(int, int);
	extern int f3(int, int);
</pre>
Now, when we assign
<pre>
	pfi = f1;
</pre>
the compiler can verify that the function pointer being assigned
is to a function which accepts two <TT>int</TT> arguments,
as <TT>pfi</TT> expects.
If, on the other hand, we declared and assigned
<pre>
	extern int x(int);
	pfi = x;
</pre>
the compiler would complain,
because <TT>pfi</TT> is supposed to point
to a function which accepts two <TT>int</TT> arguments,
and the eventual call to <TT>(*pfi)()</TT>
is going to be verified to be a call passing two arguments,
so assigning <TT>pfi</TT> to point to <TT>x</TT>
(which accepts a single argument)
is
incorrect.
