<H2>24.2 What are Function Pointers Good For?</H2>

<p>In this section we'll list several situations
where function pointers can be useful.
</p><p>A common problem is <dfn>sorting</dfn>,
that is,
rearranging a set of items into a desired sequence.
It's especially common for the
set of items
to be contained in an array.
Suppose you were writing a function to sort an array of strings.
Roughly speaking,
the algorithm for sorting the elements of an array looks like this:
<blockquote><I><pre>
for all pairs of elements in the array
	if the pair is out of order
		swap them
</pre>
</I></blockquote>In C,
the outline of the function might therefore look like this:
<pre>
	stringsort(char *strings[], int nstrings)
	{
	for( <I>all pairs of elements</I> i<I>,</I> j <I>in</I> strings )
		{
		if(strcmp(strings[i], strings[j]) &gt; 0)
			{
			char *tmp = strings[i];
			strings[i] = strings[j];
			strings[j] = tmp;
			}
		}
	}
</pre>
Remember,
the library function <TT>strcmp</TT> compares two strings
and returns either a negative number, zero, or a positive number
depending on whether the first string was ``less than,''
the same as, or ``greater than'' the second string.
If you haven't seen it before,
the series of three assignments
involving the temporary variable <TT>tmp</TT>
is a standard idiom for swapping two items.
(The more obvious pair of assignments
<pre>
	strings[i] = strings[j];
	strings[j] = strings[i];
</pre>
would just about as obviously not work,
because the first line would obliterate <TT>strings[i]</TT>
before the second line had a chance to assign it to <TT>strings[j]</TT>.)
</p><p>Naturally,
a real sort function implementing a real sorting algorithm
will be a bit more elaborate;
in particular, the details of how we choose
which pairs of elements to compare
(and in what order)
can make a huge difference in how efficiently
the function completes its job.
We'll show a complete example in a minute,
but for now,
our more important focus is on the comparison step.
The final ordering of the strings
will depend on the <TT>strcmp</TT> function's definition
of what it means for one string to be
``less than'' or ``greater than'' another.
How <TT>strcmp</TT> compares strings

(as we saw in chapter

8)
is to look at them a character at a time,
based on their values in the machine's character set
(which is how C always treats characters).
In ASCII, the character set that most computers use,
the codes representing the letters are in order,
so <TT>strcmp</TT> gives you something
pretty close to alphabetical order,
with the significant difference that all the upper-case letters
come before the lower-case letters.
So a string-sorting function built around <TT>strcmp</TT>
would sort the words
``Zeppelin,''
``able,''
``baker,''
and
``Charlie''
into the order
<blockquote><pre>
Charlie
Zeppelin
able
baker
</pre>
</blockquote><TT>strcmp</TT> is quite useless for sorting strings
which consist entirely of digits,
because it goes from left to right,
stopping when it finds the first difference,
without regard to whether it was comparing
the ten's digit of one number to the hundred's of another.
For example, a <TT>strcmp</TT>-based sort
would sort the strings
<TT>"1"</TT>,
<TT>"2"</TT>,
<TT>"3"</TT>,
<TT>"4"</TT>,
<TT>"12"</TT>,
<TT>"24"</TT>,
and
<TT>"234"</TT>
into the order
<pre>
	1
	12
	2
	234
	24
	3
	4
</pre>
</p><p>Depending on circumstances,
we might want our string sorting function to sort
into the order that <TT>strcmp</TT> uses,
or into ``dictionary''

order
(that is, with all the a's together, both upper-case and lower-case),
or into numeric order.
We could pass our <TT>stringsort</TT> function a flag or code
telling it which comparison strategy to use,
although that would mean that whenever we invented
a new comparison strategy,
we would have to define a new code or flag value
and rewrite <TT>stringsort</TT>.
But, if we observe that the final ordering
depends entirely on the behavior of the comparison function,
a neater implementation is if we write our <TT>stringsort</TT> function
to accept a pointer to the function which we want it to use
to compare each pair of strings.
It will go through its usual routine of comparing and exchanging,
but whenever it makes the comparisons,
the actual function it calls will be
the function pointed to by the function pointer we hand it.
Making it sort in a different order,
according to a different comparison strategy,
will then not require rewriting <TT>stringsort</TT> at all,
but instead
will just involve
passing it a pointer to a different comparison function
(after perhaps writing that function).
</p><p>Here is a complete implementation of <TT>stringsort</TT>,
which also accepts a pointer to the string comparison function:
<pre>
void stringsort(char *strings[], int nstrings, int (*cmpfunc)())
{
int i, j;
int didswap;

do	{
	didswap = 0;
	for(i = 0; i &lt; nstrings - 1; i++)
		{
		j = i + 1;
		if((*cmpfunc)(strings[i], strings[j]) &gt; 0)
			{
			char *tmp = strings[i];
			strings[i] = strings[j];
			strings[j] = tmp;
			didswap = 1;
			}
		}
	} while(didswap);
}
</pre>
(This code uses a fairly simpleminded sorting algorithm.
It repeatedly compares adjacent pairs of elements,
keeping track of whether it had to exchange any.
If it makes it all the way through the array
without exchanging any, it's done;
otherwise, it has at least made progress,
and it goes back for another pass.
This is not the world's best algorithm;
in fact it's not far from
the infamous ``bubble sort.''
Although our focus here is on function pointers,
not sorting,
in a minute we'll take time out
and look at a simple improvement to this algorithm
which <em>does</em> make it a decent one.)
</p><p>Now, if we have an array of strings
<pre>
	char *array1[] = {"Zeppelin", "able", "baker", "Charlie"};
</pre>
we can sort it into <TT>strcmp</TT> order by calling
<pre>
	stringsort(array1, 4, strcmp);
</pre>
Notice
that
in this call, we are <em>not</em> calling <TT>strcmp</TT> immediately;
we are generating a pointer to <TT>strcmp</TT>,
and passing that pointer as the third argument
in our call to <TT>stringsort</TT>.
</p><p>If we wanted to sort these words in ``dictionary'' order,

we could write a version of <TT>strcmp</TT> which ignores case
when comparing letters:
<pre>
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

int dictstrcmp(char *str1, char *str2)
{
while(1)
	{
	char c1 = *str1++;
	char c2 = *str2++;

	if(isupper(c1))
		c1 = tolower(c1);

	if(isupper(c2))
		c2 = tolower(c2);

	if(c1 != c2)
		return c1 - c2;
	if(c1 == '\0')
		return 0;
	}
}
</pre>
(The functions <TT>isupper</TT> and <TT>tolower</TT>
are both from the standard library
and are declared in <TT>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</TT>.
<TT>isupper</TT> returns ``true''
if its argument is an upper-case letter,
and <TT>tolower</TT> converts its argument to a lower-case letter.)
</p><p>With <TT>dictstrcmp</TT> in hand,
we can sort our array a different way:
<pre>
	stringsort(array1, 4, dictstrcmp);
</pre>
(Some C libraries contain case-independent versions of <TT>strcmp</TT>
called <TT>stricmp</TT> or <TT>strcasecmp</TT>.

Both of these would do the same thing as our <TT>dictstrcmp</TT>,
although neither of them is standard.)
</p><p>We can also write another string-comparison function
which treats the strings as numbers,
and compares them numerically:
<pre>
int numstrcmp(char *str1, char *str2)
{
int n1 = atoi(str1);
int n2 = atoi(str2);
if(n1 &lt; n2)       return -1;
else if(n1 == n2) return 0;
else	          return 1;
}
</pre>
</p><p>Then, we can sort an array of numeric strings correctly:
<pre>
	char *array2[] = {"1", "234", "12", "3", "4", "24", "2"};
	stringsort(array2, 7, numstrcmp);
</pre>
</p><p>(As an aside,
you will occasionaly see code
which is supposed to compare two integers
and return a negative, zero, or positive result--i.e. just
like the <TT>numstrcmp</TT> function above--but
which does so by the seemingly simpler technique of just saying
<pre>
	return n1 - n2;
</pre>
It turns out that this trick has a serious drawback.
Suppose that <TT>n1</TT> is 32000, and <TT>n2</TT> is -32000.
Then <TT>n1 - n2</TT> is 64000,
which is not guaranteed to fit in an <TT>int</TT>,
and will overflow on some machines,
producing an incorrect result.
So the explicit comparison code
such as <TT>numcmp</TT> used
is considerably safer.)
</p><p>Finally, since we've started looking at sorting functions,
let's look at a simple improvement to the string sorting function
we've just been using.
It has been plodding along comparing
adjacent elements,
so
when an element is far out of place,
it takes many passes to percolate it to the correct position
(one cell at a time).
The

improvement,
based on the work of Donald L. Shell,
is to compare pairs of more widely-separated elements at first,
then proceed to compare more and more closely-situated elements,
until on the last pass
(or passes)
we compare adjacent elements, as before.
Since the earlier passes will have done more of the work
(and more quickly),
the later passes will just have to do the ``final cleanup.''
Here is the improvement:
<pre>
void stringsort(char *strings[], int nstrings, int (*cmpfunc)())
{
int i, j, gap;
int didswap;

for(gap = nstrings / 2; gap &gt; 0; gap /= 2)
	{
	do	{
		didswap = 0;
		for(i = 0; i &lt; nstrings - gap; i++)
			{
			j = i + gap;
			if((*cmpfunc)(strings[i], strings[j]) &gt; 0)
				{
				char *tmp = strings[i];
				strings[i] = strings[j];
				strings[j] = tmp;
				didswap = 1;
				}
			}
		} while(didswap);
	}
}
</pre>
The inner loops are the same as before,
except that where we had before always been computing
<TT>j = i + 1</TT>,
now we compute
<TT>j = i + gap</TT>,
where <TT>gap</TT> is a new variable
(controlled by a third, outer loop)
which starts out large
(<TT>nstrings / 2</TT>),
and then diminishes until it's 1.
Although this code contains three nested loops instead of two,
it will end up making far fewer trips through the inner loop,
and so will execute faster.
</p><p>The Standard C library contains a general-purpose sort function,
<TT>qsort</TT> (declared in <TT>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT>),
which can sort any type of data (not just strings).
It's a bit trickier to use (due to this generality),
and you almost always have to write an auxiliary comparison function.
For example,
due to the generic way in which <TT>qsort</TT> calls your comparison function,
you can't use <TT>strcmp</TT> directly
even when you're sorting strings
and would be satisfied with <TT>strcmp</TT>'s ordering.
Here is an auxiliary comparison function
and the corresponding call to <TT>qsort</TT>
which would behave like our earlier call to
<TT>stringsort(array1, 4, strcmp)
</TT>:

<pre>
/* compare strings via pointers */
int pstrcmp(const void *p1, const void *p2)
{
	return strcmp(*(char * const *)p1, *(char * const *)p2);
}

...

	qsort(array1, 4, sizeof(char *), pstrcmp);
</pre>
When you call <TT>qsort</TT>,
it calls your comparison function
with pointers to the elements of your array.
Since <TT>array1</TT> is an array of pointers,
the comparison function ends up receiving pointers to pointers.
But <TT>qsort</TT> doesn't know that the array is an array of pointers;
it's written so that it can sort arrays of anything.
(That's why <TT>qsort</TT>'s third argument

is the size of the array element.)
Since <TT>qsort</TT> doesn't know
what the type of the elements being sorted is,
it uses <TT>void</TT> pointers
to those elements
when it calls the comparison function.
(The use of <TT>void</TT> pointers here recalls their use with <TT>malloc</TT>,
where the situation is similar:
<TT>malloc</TT> returns pointers to <TT>void</TT>
because it doesn't know what type we'll use the pointers to point to.)
In the ``wrapper'' function <TT>pstrcmp</TT>,
we use
the explicit cast
<TT>(char * const *)
</TT>to convert the <TT>void</TT> pointers which the function receives
into pointers to (pointers to <TT>char</TT>)
so that when we use one <TT>*</TT> operator
to find out what they point to,
we get one of the character pointers (<TT>char *</TT>)
which we know our <TT>array1</TT> array actually contains.
We pass the resulting two <TT>char *</TT>'s to <TT>strcmp</TT>
to do most of the work,
but we have to do a bit of work first to recover the correct pointers.
(The extra <TT>const</TT>
in the cast
<TT>(char * const *)
</TT>keeps the compiler from complaining,
since the pointers being passed in to the comparison function
are actually <TT>const void *</TT>,
meaning that although it may not be clear what they point to,
it's guaranteed that
we won't be using them
to modify whatever it is they point to.
We need to keep a level of <TT>const</TT>-ness in the converted pointers
so that the compiler doesn't worry
that we're going to accidentally use the converted pointers
to modify what we shouldn't.)
<br>
<br>
</p><p>That was a rather elaborate first example
of what function pointers can be used for!
Let's move on to some others.
</p><p>Suppose you wanted a program to plot equations.
You would give it a range of <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> values
(perhaps -10 to 10 along each axis),
and ask it to plot <I>y = f(x)</I> over that range
(e.g. for -10 &lt;= <I>x</I> &lt;= 10).
How would you tell it what function to plot?
By a function pointer, of course!
The plot function could then step its <TT>x</TT> variable
over the range you specified,
calling the function pointed to by your pointer
each time it needed to compute <TT>y</TT>.
You might call
<pre>
	plot(-10, 10, -10, 10, sin)
</pre>
to plot a sine wave,
and
<pre>
	plot(-10, 10, -10, 10, sqrt)
</pre>
to plot the square root function.
</p><p>(If you were to try to write this <TT>plot</TT> function,
your first question would be
how to draw lines or otherwise do graphics in C at all,
and unfortunately this is one of the questions
which the C language doesn't answer.
There are potentially different ways of doing graphics,
with different system functions to call,
for every different kind of computer,
operating system,
and graphics device.)
</p><p>One of the simplest
(and allegedly least user-friendly)
styles of user interfaces
is the <dfn>command line interface</dfn>,
or CLI.
The user types a command, hits the RETURN key,
and the system interprets the command.
Often, the first ``word'' on the line is the command name,
and any remaining words are
``arguments'' or ``option flags.''
The various shells under Unix,
COMMAND.COM under MS-DOS,
and the adventure game we've been writing
are all examples of CLI's.
If you sit down to write some code implementing a CLI,
it's simple enough to read a line of text typed by the user,
and simple enough to break it up into words.
But how do you map the first word on the line
to the code which implements that command?
A straightforward, rather simpleminded way
is to use a giant <TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> chain:
<pre>
	if(strcmp(command, "agitate") == 0)
		{ <I>code for ``agitate'' command</I> }
	else if(strcmp(command, "blend") == 0)
		{ <I>code for ``blend'' command</I> }
	else if(strcmp(command, "churn") == 0)
		{ <I>code for ``churn'' command</I> }
	...
	else	fprintf(stderr, "command not found\n");
</pre>
</p><p>This works, but can become unwieldy.
Another technique is to write several separate functions,
each implementing one command,
and then to build a table
(typically an array of structures)
associating the command name as typed by the user
with the function implementing that command.
In the table,
the command name is a string
and the function is represented by a function pointer.
With this table in hand,
processing the user's command becomes a relatively simple matter
of searching the table for the matching command string
and then calling the corresponding pointed-to function.

(We'll see an example
of this technique
in this week's assignment.)
</p><p>Our last example concerns larger, more elaborate systems
which manipulate many types of data.
(Here, by ``types of data,''
I am referring to data structures used by the program,
presumably implemented as <TT>struct</TT>s,
but in any case
more elaborate than C's basic data types.)
It is often the case that similar operations
must be performed on dissimilar data types.
The conventional way of implementing such operations
is to have the code for each operation
look at the data type it's operating on
and adjust its behavior accordingly;
in the worst case,
each piece of code
(for each operation)
will have a long <TT>switch</TT> statement
or <TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> chain
switching among <I>n</I> separate, different ways
of performing the operation on <I>n</I> different data types.
If a new data type is ever added,
new cases must be added to all
segments
of the code
implementing all of the operations.
</p><p>Another way of organizing such code
is to place one or more function pointers
right there

in the data structures describing each data type.
These pointers point to functions
which are streamlined and optimized
for performing the operations on just one data type.
(Each piece of data would obviously have its pointer(s) set
to point to the function(s) for its own data type.)
This idea is one of the cornerstones of
<dfn>Object-Oriented Programming</dfn>.
We could use a version of it in our adventure game, too:
rather than writing new, global pieces of code
implementing each new command verb we want to let the user type,
and then making each of those pieces of code
check all sorts of attributes
to ensure that the command can't be used on inappropriate objects
(``break water with cup'',
``light candle with bucket,'' etc.)
we could attach special-purpose pieces of code
to the individual objects themselves
(via function pointers, of course)
and arrange that the code would only fire up
if the player were trying to use the relevant object.
