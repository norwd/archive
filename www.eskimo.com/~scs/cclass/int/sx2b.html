<H2>16.2: Opening and Closing Files
(<TT>fopen</TT>, <TT>fclose</TT>, etc.)</H2>

<p>As mentioned,
the <TT>fopen</TT> function opens a file
(or perhaps some other I/O object,
if the operating system permits devices to be treated as if they were files)
and returns a stream (<TT>FILE *</TT>)
to be used with later I/O calls.
<TT>fopen</TT>'s <dfn>prototype</dfn>
is
<pre>
	FILE *fopen(char *filename, char *mode)
</pre>
For the rest of this chapter,
we'll often use prototype notations like these to describe functions,
since a prototype gives us just the information we need about a function:
its name,
its return type,
and the
types of its arguments
(perhaps along with identifying names for the arguments).
</p><p><TT>fopen</TT>'s prototype tells us
that it returns a <TT>FILE *</TT>,
as we expect,
and that it takes two arguments,
both of type <TT>char *</TT>
(i.e. ``string'').
The first string is the file name,
which can be any string (simple filename or complicated pathname)
which is acceptable to the underlying operating system.
The second string
is the <dfn>mode</dfn> in which the file should be opened.
The simple mode arguments are
</p><UL><li><cw>r</>
open for reading
<li><cw>w</>
open for writing
(truncate file before writing,
if it exists already)
<li><cw>a</>
open for writing,
appending to file if it exists already
</UL>You can also tack two optional modifier characters onto the mode string:
<UL><li><cw>+</>
open for both reading and writing
<li><cw>b</>
open for ``binary'' I/O
</UL>Modes <TT>"r+"</TT> and <TT>"w+"</TT> let you read <em>and</em>  write to the file.
You can't read and write at the same time;
between stints of reading and stints of writing
you must explicitly reposition the read/write
indicator
(see

section 16.9 below).
<p>``Binary'' or <TT>"b"</TT> mode
means that no translations are done by the <TT>stdio</TT> library
when reading or writing the file.
Normally,
the newline character <TT>\n</TT>
is translated to and from
some operating system dependent end-of-line representation
(LF on Unix,
CR on the Macintosh,
CRLF on MS-DOS,
or an end-of-record mark on record-oriented operating systems).
On MS-DOS systems,
without binary mode,
a control-Z character in a file is treated as an end-of-file indication;
neither the control-Z nor any characters following it will be 
seen by a program reading the file.

In binary mode,
on the other hand,
characters are read and written verbatim;
newline characters
(and, in MS-DOS, control-Z characters)
are not treated specially.
You need to use binary mode when what you're reading and writing
is arbitrary byte values
which are not to be interpreted as text characters.
</p><p>Of course,
it's possible to use both optional modes:
<TT>"r+b"</TT>, <TT>"w+b"</TT>, etc.
(For
maximum
portability,
it's preferable to put <TT>+</TT> before <TT>b</TT>
in these cases.)

</p><p>If, for any reason,
<TT>fopen</TT> can't open the requested file in the requested mode,
it returns a null pointer (<TT>NULL</TT>).
Whenever you call <TT>fopen</TT>,
you must check that the returned file pointer is not null
<em>before</em> attempting to use
the pointer
for any I/O.
</p><p>Most operating systems
let you keep only a limited number of files open at a time.
Also,
many versions of the stdio library
allocate only a limited number of <TT>FILE</TT> structures
for <TT>fopen</TT> to return pointers to.
Therefore,
if a program opens many files in sequence,
it's important for it to <dfn>close</dfn> them as it finishes with them.
Closing a file <TT>fp</TT> simply requires calling <TT>fclose(fp)</TT>.
(Any open streams are automatically closed when the program exits normally.)

</p><p>The standard I/O library normally <dfn>buffers</dfn> 
characters--that is,
when you're writing, it saves up a chunk of characters and then 
writes them to the actual file all at once;
and when you're reading,
it reads a chunk of characters from the file
all at once
and then parcels
them out to the program one at a time
(or as many characters at a time as
the program asks for).
The reasons for buffering have to do with efficiency--the
calls to the underlying operating system which request it to 
read and write files may be inefficient if called once for each 
character or each few characters,
and may be much more efficient if they're always called for large 
blocks of characters.
Normally, buffering is transparent to your program,
but occasionally it's necessary to ensure that some characters 
have actually been written.
(One example is when you've printed a prompt to the standard 
output, and you want to be sure that it's actually been written 
to the screen.)
In these cases, you can call <TT>fflush(fp)</TT>,
which flushes
a stream's
buffered output to the underlying file
(or screen, or other device).
Naturally, the library automatically flushes output when you 
call <TT>fclose</TT> on a stream,
and also when your program exits.
</p><p>(<TT>fflush</TT> is only defined for output streams.
There is no standard way to discard unread, buffered input.)
