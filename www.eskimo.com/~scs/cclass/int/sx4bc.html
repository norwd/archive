<H3>18.3.2: <TT>do</TT>/<TT>while</TT></H3>

<p>[This section corresponds to K&amp;R Sec. 3.6]
</p><p>Briefly stated, a <TT>do</TT>/<TT>while</TT> loop
is like a <TT>while</TT> loop,
except that the body of the loop is always executed at least once,
even if the condition is initially false.
We'll motivate the usefulness of this loop with a slightly long example.
</p><p>We know that the digit character <TT>'1'</TT>
is not the same as the
<TT>int</TT> value 1,
and that the string <TT>"123"</TT> is not the same as the
<TT>int</TT> value 123.
We've learned that the <TT>atoi</TT> function
will convert a string (containing digits) to the corresponding integer,
and that we can use the <TT>sprintf</TT> function
to generate a string of digits corresponding to an integer.
Now let's see how we could convert an integer
to a string of digits by hand,
if for some reason we couldn't use <TT>sprintf</TT>
but had to do it ourselves.
</p><p>If the number were less than 10 and not negative,
it would be easy.
Since we know that the digit characters <TT>'0'</TT> to <TT>'9'</TT>
have consecutive character set values,
the expression <TT>i + '0'</TT>
gives the character corresponding to <TT>i</TT>'s value
if <TT>i</TT> is an integer between 0 and 9, inclusive.
So our very first stab at an integer-to-string routine,
which would only work for one-digit numbers,
might look like this:
<pre>
	char string[2];
	string[0] = i + '0';
	string[1] = '\0';
</pre>
(Remember, the null character <TT>\0</TT>
is required to terminate strings in C.)
</p><p>The limitation to single-digit numbers is obviously not acceptable.
Suppose we went a little further,
and arranged to handle numbers less than 100,
by using an <TT>if</TT> statement
to choose between the 1-digit case and the 2-digit case:
<pre>
	char string[3];
	if(i &lt; 10)
		{
		string[0] = i + '0';
		string[1] = '\0';
		}
	else	{
		string[0] = (i / 10) + '0';
		string[1] = (i % 10) + '0';
		string[2] = '\0';
		}
</pre>
In the two-digit case, the subexpression <TT>i % 10</TT>
gives us the value of the low-order (1's) digit of the result,
and <TT>i / 10</TT> gives us the high-order (10's) digit.
</p><p>We've still got a pretty limited piece of code,
and if we kept extending it in this way,
with explicit <TT>if</TT> statements
depending on how many digits the number could have,
we'd duplicate a lot of code and end up with
quite
a mess,
and we wouldn't necessarily know how many cases we'll need
(at least 5,
because type <TT>int</TT> is guaranteed to hold
integers up to at least 32,767,
but on some systems it can hold more).
The right solution to this problem,
therefore,
involves a loop.
</p><p>One way of thinking about
<TT>if</TT> statements and <TT>while</TT> loops
is that an <TT>if</TT> statement allows you to
select a chunk of code which,
if required,
will complete some step towards the accomplishment of an overall task,
while a <TT>while</TT> loop selects a chunk of code
that will whittle away at some task or subtask,
but without necessarily completing it on the first go,
such that several trips through the loop might be required.
Since the operation <TT>i % 10</TT>
does give us one digit of our answer,
but since we may end up having many digits,
our next attempt
is to wrap the <TT>i % 10</TT>
and <TT>i / 10</TT> code up
in a <TT>while</TT> loop:
<pre>
	char string[25];
	int j = 24;
	string[j] = '\0';
	while(i &gt; 0)
		{
		string[--j] = (i % 10) + '0';
		i /= 10;
		}
</pre>
Here we use an auxiliary variable <TT>j</TT>
to keep track of which element of the <TT>string</TT> array
we're filling in.
We fill in the array from the end back towards the beginning,
because successive remainders when dividing <TT>i</TT> by 10
give us digits in the reverse order
(the reverse, that is, of the order we'd write the digits left-to-right).
In this code,
<TT>j</TT>
holds the index
of the element we've just filled in,
so we use the predecrement form <TT>--j</TT>
to decrement <TT>j</TT> before filling in the next digit.
When we're done, <TT>string[j]</TT>
will be the first (leftmost) digit of our result.
(For the <TT>string</TT> array as declared,
<TT>i</TT> had better have fewer than 25 digits,
but this is a safe assumption
even for 64-bit machines.)
</p><p>The third try just above,
using a <TT>while</TT> loop,
will work just fine
<em>except</em> in the case when <TT>i == 0</TT>.
If <TT>i</TT> is 0,
the controlling expression <TT>i &gt; 0</TT>
of the <TT>while</TT> loop
will immediately be false,
and no trips through the loop will be taken.
This means that the integer 0
will be converted to the empty string <TT>""</TT>,
not the string <TT>"0"</TT>.
In this case, we <em>would</em> like to take
one trip through the loop
(to generate the digit 0)
even though the condition is initially false.
</p><p>For loops like these,
C has the <TT>do</TT>/<TT>while</TT> loop,
which tests the condition at the bottom of the loop,
after making the first

trip through without checking.
The syntax of the <TT>do</TT>/<TT>while</TT> loop is
<pre>
	do <I>statement</I>
	while( <I>expression</I> );
</pre>
The <I>statement</I> is almost always a brace-enclosed block of statements,
because a <TT>do</TT>/<TT>while</TT> loop without braces looks odd
even if there's only one statement in the body.
Notice that there is a semicolon
after the close parenthesis
after the controlling expression.
</p><p>Using a <TT>do</TT>/<TT>while</TT> loop,
we can write
our final
version of the integer-to-string converter:
<pre>
	char string[25];
	int j = 24;
	string[j] = '\0';
	do	{
		string[--j] = (i % 10) + '0';
		i /= 10;
		} while(i &gt; 0);
</pre>
This version is now almost perfect;
its only deficiency is that it has no provision for negative numbers.

</p><p>C's <TT>do</TT>/<TT>while</TT> loop is analogous to the
<TT>repeat</TT>/<TT>until</TT> loop in Pascal.
(C's <TT>while</TT> loop, on the other hand,
is like Pascal's <TT>while</TT>/<TT>do</TT> loop.)
