<H2>16.7: Arbitrary Input and Output
(<TT>fread</TT>, <TT>fwrite</TT>)</H2>

<p>Sometimes,
you want to read a chunk of characters,
without treating it as a ``line''
(as <TT>gets</TT> and <TT>fgets</TT> do)
and certainly without doing any <TT>scanf</TT>-like parsing.
Similarly,
you may want to write an arbitrary chunk of characters,
not as a string or a line.
(Furthermore, the chunk might contain
one or more <TT>\0</TT> characters
which would otherwise terminate a string.)
In these situations,
you want <TT>fread</TT> and <TT>fwrite</TT>.
</p><p><TT>fread</TT>'s prototype is
<pre>
	size_t fread(void *buf, size_t sz, size_t n, FILE *fp)
</pre>
Remember,
<TT>void *</TT> is a ``generic'' pointer type
(the type returned by <TT>malloc</TT>),
which can point to anything.
It may make it easier to think about <TT>fread</TT> at first
if you imagine that its first argument were <TT>char *</TT>.
<TT>size_t</TT> is a type we haven't met yet;
it's a type that's guaranteed to be able to hold
the size of any object
(i.e. as returned by the <TT>sizeof</TT> operator);
you can imagine for the moment that it's <TT>unsigned int</TT>.
<TT>fread</TT> reads up to <TT>n</TT> objects,
each of size <TT>sz</TT>,
from the stream <TT>fp</TT>,
and copies them to the buffer pointed to by <TT>buf</TT>.
It reads them as a stream of bytes,
without doing any particular formatting or other interpretation.
(However, the default underlying stdio machinery
may still translate

newline characters
unless the stream is open in binary or <TT>"b"</TT> mode).
<TT>fread</TT>
returns the number of items read.
It returns 0
(not <TT>EOF</TT>)

at end-of-file.
</p><p>Similarly,
the prototype for <TT>fwrite</TT> is
<pre>
	size_t fwrite(void *buf, size_t sz, size_t n, FILE *fp)
</pre>
<pre>
</pre>
</p><p><TT>fread</TT> and <TT>fwrite</TT> are intended to write chunks 
or ``arrays'' of items,
with the interpretation that there are <TT>n</TT> items
each of size <TT>sz</TT>.
If what you want to do is read <I>n</I> characters,
you can call <TT>fread</TT> with <TT>sz</TT> as 1,
and <TT>buf</TT> pointing to an array of at least <I>n</I> characters.

The return value will be in units of characters.
(Of course,
you could write <I>n</I> characters
by using similar arguments with <TT>fwrite</TT>.)
</p><p>Besides reading and writing ``blocks'' of characters,
you can use <TT>fread</TT> and <TT>fwrite</TT>
to do ``binary'' I/O.
For example,
if you have an array of <TT>int</TT> values:
<pre>
	int array[N];
</pre>
you could write them all out at once by calling
<pre>
	fwrite(array, sizeof(int), N, fp);
</pre>
This

would write them all out in a byte-for-byte way,
i.e. as a block copy of bytes from memory to the output stream,
i.e. <em>not</em> as strings of digits
as <TT>printf</TT> <TT>%d</TT> would.
Since some of the bytes within the array of <TT>int</TT>
might have the same value as the <TT>\n</TT> character,
you would want to make sure that you had opened the stream
in binary or <TT>"wb"</TT> mode when calling <TT>fopen</TT>.
</p><p>Later,
you could try to read the integers in by calling
<pre>
	fread(array, sizeof(int), N, fp);
</pre>
</p><p>Similarly,
if you had a variable of some structure type:
<pre>
	struct somestruct x;
</pre>
you could write it out all at once by calling
<pre>
	fwrite(&amp;x, sizeof(struct somestruct), 1, fp);
</pre>
and read it in by calling
<pre>
	fread(&amp;x, sizeof(struct somestruct), 1, fp);
</pre>
</p><p>Although this ``binary'' I/O
using <TT>fwrite</TT> and <TT>fread</TT>
looks easy and convenient,
it has a number of drawbacks,
some of which we'll discuss in the next chapter.
