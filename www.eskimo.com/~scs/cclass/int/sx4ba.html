<H3>18.1.2: <TT>short int</TT></H3>

<p>Another type we haven't met is <TT>short int</TT>.
A <TT>short int</TT>
has the same guarantees as a plain <TT>int</TT>:
it will hold integers in at least the range +-32,767.
The difference between <TT>short int</TT> and plain <TT>int</TT>
is that <TT>short int</TT> <em>might</em> be smaller.
Remember, the definitions of both these types
(like all C types)
is that they have <em>at least</em> the specified range.
On some machines, plain <TT>int</TT> will hold numbers greater than 32,767.
(On 32-bit machines,
for example,
it's common for plain <TT>int</TT> to be 32 bits,
and to hold +-2,147,483,647.
Yes, this is all the way up to the minimum range
for a <TT>long int</TT>.)
You might use a <TT>short int</TT> when you had a lot of them
and were worried about saving memory.
If you had a large array of integers all less than 32,768,
or a large number of structures with one or more members holding
integers all less than 32,768,
you might declare the array or the structure members as <TT>short int</TT>,
to avoid devoting 4 bytes to each of them on 32-bit machines.
