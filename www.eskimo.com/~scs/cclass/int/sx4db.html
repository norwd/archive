<H3>18.2.4: The Comma Operator</H3>

<p>Once in a while,
you find yourself in a situation
in which C expects a single expression,
but you have two things you want to say.
The most common
(and in fact the only common)
example is
in a
<TT>for</TT> loop,
specifically
the first and third controlling expressions.
What if
(for example)
you want to have a loop
in which <TT>i</TT> counts up from 0 to 10
at the same time that <TT>j</TT> is counting down from 10 to 0?
You could manipulate <TT>i</TT> in the loop header
and <TT>j</TT> ``by hand'':
<pre>
	j = 10;
	for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
		{
		<I>... rest of loop ...</I>
		j--;
		}
</pre>
but here it's harder to see
the parallel nature of <TT>i</TT> and <TT>j</TT>,
and it also turns out that this won't work right
if the loop contains a <TT>continue</TT> statement.
(A <TT>continue</TT> would jump back to the top of the loop,
and <TT>i</TT> would be incremented
but <TT>j</TT> would <em>not</em> be decremented.)
You could compute <TT>j</TT> in terms of <TT>i</TT>:
<pre>
	for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
		{
		j = 10 - i;
		<I>... rest of loop ...</I>
		}
</pre>
but this also makes <TT>j</TT> needlessly subservient.

The usual way to write this loop in C would be
<pre>
	for(i = 0, j = 10; i &lt; 10; i++, j--)
		{
		<I>... rest of loop ...</I>
		}
</pre>
Here, the first (initialization) expression is
<pre>
	i = 0, j = 10
</pre>
The comma is the <dfn>comma operator</dfn>,
which simply evaluates the first subexpression <TT>i = 0</TT>,
then the second <TT>j = 10</TT>.
The third controlling expression,
<pre>
	i++, j--
</pre>
also contains a comma operator,
and again,
performs first <TT>i++</TT> and then <TT>j--</TT>.
</p><p>Precisely stated,
the meaning of the comma operator in the general expression
<pre>
	<I>e1</I> , <I>e2</I>
</pre>
is ``evaluate the subexpression <I>e1</I>, then evaluate <I>e2</I>;
the value of the expression is the value of <I>e2</I>.''
Therefore,
<I>e1</I> had better involve an assignment
or an increment <TT>++</TT> or decrement <TT>--</TT>
or function call
or some other kind of <dfn>side effect</dfn>,
because otherwise it would calculate a value which would be discarded.
</p><p>There's hardly any reason to use a comma operator
anywhere other than
in the first and third controlling expressions of a <TT>for</TT> loop,
and in fact most of the commas you see in C programs
are <em>not</em> comma operators.
In particular,
the commas between the arguments in a function call
are not comma operators;
they are just punctuation
which separate several argument expressions.
It's pretty easy to see that they
cannot be comma operators,
otherwise in a call like
<pre>
	printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
</pre>
the action would be ``evaluate the string <TT>"Hello, %s!\n"</TT>,
discard it,
and pass only the string <TT>"world"</TT> to <TT>printf</TT>.''
This is of course <em>not</em> what we want;
we expect both strings to be passed to <TT>printf</TT>
as two separate arguments
(which is, of course, what happens).
