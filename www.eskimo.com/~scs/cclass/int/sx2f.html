<H2>16.6: Formatted Input (<TT>scanf</TT>)</H2>

<p>Just as <TT>putchar</TT> has its <TT>getchar</TT>
and <TT>fputs</TT> has its <TT>fgets</TT>,
there's an input analog to <TT>printf</TT>,
namely <TT>scanf</TT>.
<TT>scanf</TT> reads characters
from standard input,
under control of a format string,
perhaps converting some components of the string
and storing them into variables.
For example,
just as you could use the call
<pre>
	printf("(%d, %d)", x, y);
</pre>
to print two integer values and some surrounding punctuation,
you could use the call
<pre>
	scanf("(%d, %d)", &amp;x, &amp;y);
</pre>
to attempt to extract two integer values
from some input containing similar punctuation.
</p><p><TT>scanf</TT> interprets a format string,
much like <TT>printf</TT>,
with the first difference being
that <TT>scanf</TT> attempts to read characters
and match them against the format string,
rather than printing under control of the format string.
For each ordinary character in the format string,
<TT>scanf</TT> expects to see that character on the input;
if not, it fails.
For each format specifier in the input string,
<TT>scanf</TT> attempts to match and convert
a string appropriate to the format specifier,
storing the converted result into a variable
pointed to by the corresponding argument.
If it can't find any characters matching the format specifier,
it fails.
</p><p>Since <TT>scanf</TT> ``returns'' many values
(one for each format specifier in the format string),
it must do so using pointers which the caller passes.
For each value to be converted,
the caller passes a pointer to the variable
(or other location)
where <TT>scanf</TT> should write the converted value.
All arguments passed to <TT>scanf</TT> must be pointers.
</p><p>The format strings used by <TT>scanf</TT>
are similar to those used by <TT>printf</TT>,
but there are several differences.
</p><p>The optional <I>width</I>
gives the maximum number of characters to read
while performing the conversion requested by a particular format specifier.
(If there are many adjacent characters which could satisfy
a request--many
digits for one of the numeric conversions,
or many characters for <TT>%s</TT>
conversion--the
<I>width</I> keeps <TT>scanf</TT> from gobbling all of them up at once.)
</p><p>There is no equivalent to the <I>precision</I> modifier.
</p><p>If the <TT>*</TT> flag appears,
it indicates that the converted value should be discarded,
not written to a location
pointed to by one

of the pointers in the argument list.
(In other words,
there is no corresponding argument.)
Since <TT>*</TT> is usurped for this function,
there is no way to use a variable field width
from the argument list
with <TT>scanf</TT>.
There are no other <I>flags</I>.
</p><p>The <I>modifier</I> characters are more significant.
An <TT>h</TT> indicates that the corresponding integer pointer argument
(for <TT>%d</TT>, <TT>%u</TT>, <TT>%o</TT>, or <TT>%x</TT>)
is a <TT>short int *</TT> or <TT>unsigned short int *</TT>.
An <TT>l</TT> indicates that the corresponding integer pointer argument
(for <TT>%d</TT>, <TT>%u</TT>, <TT>%o</TT>, or <TT>%x</TT>)
is a <TT>long int *</TT> or
<TT>unsigned long int *</TT>,
or that the floating-point pointer argument
(for <TT>%e</TT>, <TT>%f</TT>, or <TT>%g</TT>)
is a <TT>double *</TT> rather than a <TT>float *</TT>.
(Similarly,
an <TT>L</TT> indicates a <TT>long double *</TT>.)
</p><p>The <TT>%c</TT> format will read more than one character
if an explicit <I>width</I> greater than 1 is specified.
The corresponding argument must be a pointer to enough space
to hold all the characters read.
</p><p>The <TT>%e</TT>, <TT>%f</TT>, and <TT>%g</TT> formats
all read strings in either scientific notation
or conventional decimal fraction <TT>m.n</TT> notation.
(In other words,
the three formats
act
just
the same.)
However,
they assume a <TT>float *</TT> argument
unless the <TT>l</TT> modifier appears,
in which case they expect a <TT>double *</TT>.
(This is in contrast to <TT>printf</TT>,
which accepts either <TT>float</TT> or <TT>double</TT> arguments
for <TT>%e</TT>, <TT>%f</TT>, and <TT>%g</TT>,
due to the default argument promotions.)
</p><p>The <TT>%i</TT> format
will read a number in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal,
taking a leading <TT>0</TT> to indicate octal
and a leading <TT>0x</TT> (or <TT>0X</TT>) to indicate hexadecimal,
i.e. the same rules as used by C constants.
</p><p>The <TT>%n</TT> format causes the number of characters read so far
(by this call to <TT>scanf</TT>)
to be stored in the integer pointed to by the corresponding argument.
</p><p>The <TT>%s</TT> format will read a string,
up to the next whitespace character,
and copy the string,
terminated by a <TT>\0</TT>,
to the corresponding argument,
which must be a <TT>char *</TT>.
The caller must ensure (perhaps by using an explicit <I>width</I>)
that there is enough space to hold the received characters.
</p><p><TT>scanf</TT> has a special format specifier <TT>%[</TT>...<TT>]</TT>,
which matches any string composed of characters specified in the <TT>[]</TT>.
For example,
<TT>%[abc]</TT>
would match any string composed of a's, b's, and c's.
The corresponding argument is a <TT>char *</TT>;
the matched string is written to the location pointed to,
followed by a <TT>\0</TT>.
The caller must ensure
(perhaps by using an explicit <I>width</I>)
that there is enough space to hold the received characters.
A second form,
<TT>%[^</TT>...<TT>]</TT>,
matches a string of characters <em>not</em> found in the set.
For example,
<TT>scanf("(%[^)])", s)</TT> reads, into the string <TT>s</TT>,
a string of characters (possibly including whitespace)
from an input in which the string appears enclosed in parentheses.
It may also be possible to specify ranges of characters
(e.g. <TT>%[a-z]</TT>, <TT>%[0-9]</TT>, etc.),
but these are not as portable.
</p><p>With the exception of <TT>%c</TT>, <TT>%n</TT>, and <TT>%[</TT>,
all of the conversion specifiers skip any leading whitespace
(spaces, tabs, or newlines)
which might precede the value or string converted.
Also,
any whitespace character in the format string
matches any number of whitespace characters in the input.
Therefore,
the format <TT>"%d %d"</TT>
would match the input <TT>"12 34"</TT>
or <TT>"12&nbsp;&nbsp;34"</TT>
or <TT>"12\t34"</TT>.
However,
the format <TT>"%d%d"</TT> would match all of these inputs as well,
since the second <TT>%d</TT> first

scans past any whitespace preceding the <TT>34</TT>.
</p><p><TT>scanf</TT> returns the number of items
it successfully converts and stores.
It will return a number less than expected
(less than the number of format specifiers not containing <TT>*</TT>,
or less than the number of corresponding pointer arguments)
if the conversion fails at any point,
and it will leave any unrecognized characters
(i.e. the ones that caused the last match to fail)
waiting in the input for next time.
<TT>scanf</TT> returns <TT>EOF</TT>
if it encounters end-of-file before converting anything.
</p><p>If you want to read characters from an arbitrary stream,
you can use <TT>fscanf</TT>,
which takes an initial <TT>FILE *</TT> argument.
</p><p>You can scan and convert characters from a string
(rather than from a stream)
using <TT>sscanf</TT>.
For example,
<pre>
	int x, y;
	sscanf("12 34", "%d %d", &amp;x, &amp;y);
</pre>
would place 12 in <TT>x</TT> and 34 in <TT>y</TT>.
</p><p><TT>scanf</TT> and <TT>fscanf</TT> are seductively useful,
but they have a number of drawbacks in practice.
They seem to make it very easy to,
say,
prompt the user for a number:
<pre>
	int x;
	printf("Type a number:\n");
	scanf("%d", &amp;x);
</pre>
But what happens if the user fumbles,
and types something other than a number?
Even if the code checks <TT>scanf</TT>'s return value,
and prompts the user again if <TT>scanf</TT> returns 0,
the non-numeric input remains on the input,
and will be encountered by the next call to <TT>scanf</TT>
unless some other steps are taken.
(That is,
<TT>scanf</TT> will rediscover the user's old, bad input
before it gets to any new input.)
It's also easy to write things like
<pre>
	scanf("%d\n", &amp;x);
</pre>
but this code does <em>not</em> work as intended;
the <TT>\n</TT> in the format string is a whitespace character,
which asks <TT>scanf</TT> to discard one or more whitespace characters,
so it will <em>keep reading</em> characters
as long as they are whitespace characters,
that is,
it will read characters
until it finds something that is not a whitespace character.
It won't read that eventual non-whitespace character once it finds it,
but in the process of looking for it
it will seem to jam your program,
since the call to <TT>scanf</TT> won't return
right after the user types a number.

</p><p>Therefore,
it's much better to read interactive user input
a line at a time,
and then use functions like <TT>atoi</TT>
(or perhaps <TT>sscanf</TT>)
to interpret the line that the user typed.
