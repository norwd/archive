<H2>16.10: File Operations
(<TT>remove</TT>, <TT>rename</TT>, etc.)</H2>

<p>You can delete a file
by calling
<pre>
	int remove(char *filename)
</pre>
</p><p>You can rename a file by calling
<pre>
	int rename(char *oldname, char *newname)
</pre>
Both of these functions return zero if they succeed
and a nonzero value if they fail.
</p><p>There are no standard C functions for dealing with directories 
(e.g. listing or creating them).
On many systems,
you will find functions <TT>mkdir</TT> for making directories
and <TT>rmdir</TT> for removing them,
and a suite of functions
<TT>opendir</TT>, <TT>readdir</TT>, and <TT>closedir</TT>
for listing them.
Since these functions aren't standard, however,
we won't talk about them here.

(They exist on most Unix systems,
but they're not standard under MS-DOS or Macintosh compilers,
although you can find implementations on the net.)
