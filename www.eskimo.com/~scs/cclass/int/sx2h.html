<H2>16.8: <TT>EOF</TT> and Errors</H2>

<p>When a function returns <TT>EOF</TT>
(or, occasionally, 0 or <TT>NULL</TT>,
as in the case of <TT>fread</TT> and <TT>fgets</TT> respectively),
we commonly say that we have reached ``end of file,''
but it turns out that it's also possible
that there's been some kind of I/O error.
When you want to distinguish between end-of-file and error,
you can do so with the <TT>feof</TT> and <TT>ferror</TT> functions.
<TT>feof(fp)</TT> returns nonzero
(that is, ``true'')
if end-of-file has been reached on the stream <TT>fp</TT>,
and <TT>ferror(fp)</TT> returns nonzero
if there has been an error.
Notice the past tense and passive voice:
<TT>feof</TT> returns nonzero if end-of-file
<em>has been reached</em>.
It does <em>not</em> tell you that the next attempt to read from 
the stream will reach end-of-file,
but rather that the previous attempt
(by some other function)
already <em>did</em>.
(If you know Pascal,
you may notice that the end-of-file detection situation in C
is therefore
quite different from Pascal.)
Therefore, you would never write a loop like
<pre>
	while(!feof(fp))
		fgets(line, max, fp);
</pre>
Instead, check the return value of the input function directly:
<pre>
	while(fgets(line, max, fp) != NULL)
</pre>
With a very few possible exceptions, you don't use <TT>feof</TT> 
to <em>detect</em> end-of-file;
you use <TT>feof</TT> or <TT>ferror</TT> to distinguish 
between end-of-file and error.
(You can also use <TT>ferror</TT> to diagnose error conditions on 
output files.)
</p><p>Since the end-of-file and error conditions tend to persist on a stream,
it's sometimes necessary to clear (reset) them,
which you can do with <TT>clearerr(FILE *fp)</TT>.
</p><p>What should your program do if it detects an I/O error?
Certainly, it cannot continue as usual;
usually, it will print an error message.
The simplest error messages are of the form
<pre>
	fp = fopen(filename, "r");
	if(fp == NULL)
		{
		fprintf(stderr, "can't open file\n");
		return;
		}
</pre>
or
<pre>
	while(fgets(line, max, fp) != NULL)
		{
		<I>... process input ...</I>
		}

	if(ferror(fp))
		fprintf(stderr, "error reading input\n");
</pre>
or
<pre>
	fprintf(ofp, "%d %d %d\n", a, b, c);
	if(ferror(ofp))
		fprintf(stderr, "output write error\n");
</pre>
Error messages are much more useful,
however,
if they include a bit more information,
such as the name of the file for which the operation is failing,
and if possible <em>why</em> it is failing.
For example,
here is a more polite way to report that a file could not be opened:
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;	/* for fopen */
	#include &lt;errno.h&gt;	/* for errno */
	#include &lt;string.h&gt;	/* for strerror */

	fp = fopen(filename, "r");
	if(fp == NULL)
		{
		fprintf(stderr, "can't open %s for reading: %s\n",
					filename, strerror(errno));
		return;
		}
</pre>
<TT>errno</TT> is a global variable, declared in <TT>&lt;errno.h&gt;</TT>,
which may

contain
a numeric code
indicating the reason for a recent system-related error
such as inability to open a file.
The <TT>strerror</TT> function takes an <TT>errno</TT> code
and returns a human-readable string
such as ``No such file'' or ``Permission denied''.
</p><p>An even more useful error message,
especially for a ``toolkit'' program
intended to be used in conjunction with other programs,
would include in the message text
the name of the program reporting the error.
