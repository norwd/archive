<H2>25.3 Special Issues with Varargs Functions</H2>

<p>When a function with a variable-length argument list is called,
the variable arguments are passed
using C's old ``default argument promotions.''
These say that types <TT>char</TT> and <TT>short int</TT>
are automatically promoted to <TT>int</TT>,
and type <TT>float</TT> is automatically promoted to <TT>double</TT>.
Therefore, varargs functions will <em>never</em> receive
arguments of type <TT>char</TT>, <TT>short int</TT>, or <TT>float</TT>.
Furthermore, it's an error to ``pass'' the type names
<TT>char</TT>, <TT>short int</TT>, or <TT>float</TT>
as the second argument to the <TT>va_arg()</TT> macro.
Finally, for vaguely related reasons,
the last fixed argument
(the one whose name is passed as
the second argument to the <TT>va_start()</TT> macro)
should not be of type <TT>char</TT>, <TT>short int</TT>,
or <TT>float</TT>,
either.
</p><p>A frequently-asked question is,
``How can I determine how many arguments
my function was actually called with?''
The answer,
as discussed above,
is that <em>you</em> (or your code) must figure it out somehow,
generally by looking at the arguments themselves
(or, in the case of <TT>printf</TT>,
by using clues which are designed into the first, fixed arguments).
There is no Standard way of asking
the compiler or run-time system
how many arguments were actually passed,
or what their types are.
</p><p>The macros <TT>va_start()</TT> and <TT>va_arg()</TT>
are referred to as macros because they can't possibly be functions.
<TT>va_start()</TT> initializes
(that is, sets the value of)
its first argument,
and it
uses its second argument not as a value but as a location.

Even more unusually,
<TT>va_arg()</TT> accepts a type name as its second argument,
which no function in C,
indeed no <em>anything</em> in C other than <TT>sizeof</TT>,
can ever do.
Finally,
<TT>va_arg()</TT> has no one return type
(as it would have to if it were a function);
the type it ``returns'' is determined by its second argument.
</p><p>The <TT>va_list</TT> type, whatever it is, is a mostly normal type.
In particular, you can pass it on to other functions,
and it is frequently quite useful to do so.
For example, suppose that you want to write an <TT>error</TT> function,
which will print nicely annotated error messages
complete with filenames, line numbers, severity indicators, and the like.
Furthermore, suppose that the rest of your program will find it useful,
when calling this <TT>error</TT> function,
to embed <TT>%</TT> sequences in the string to be printed,
requesting that extra arguments be interpolated,
just like <TT>printf</TT>.
The obvious question is,
will the <TT>error</TT> function have to duplicate
all of <TT>printf</TT>'s code
for parsing format strings and formatting variable arguments
(which isn't impossible, as we've seen),
or can it somehow call on <TT>printf</TT> or a related function
to do most of the work?
</p><p>To be precise, here's the outline of the <TT>error</TT> function
we'd like to write:
<pre>
	extern char *filename;		/* current input file name */
	extern int lineno;		/* current line number */

	void error(char *msg, ...)
	{
		fprintf(stderr, "%s, line %d: error:", filename, lineno);
		fprintf(stderr, msg, <I>what goes here?</I> );
		fprintf(stderr, "\n");
	}
</pre>
The tricky line is the second call to <TT>fprintf</TT>.
We have the string, <TT>msg</TT>,
we want

to print,
possibly containing <TT>%</TT> characters.
How do we pass down to <TT>fprintf</TT>
the extra arguments which our caller passed to us?
</p><p>The answer is that we don't;
there's no way to say
``call this function with the same arguments I got,
however many of them there are.''
(The run-time system simply doesn't have enough information
to do this sort of thing,
which is why it can't tell you
how many arguments you got called with, either.)
However, there's a variant version of <TT>fprintf</TT>
which is designed
for just this sort of situation.
The variant is called <TT>vfprintf</TT>
(where
the <TT>v</TT>
stands for ``varargs''),
and a call to it looks something like this:
<pre>
	void error(char *msg, ...)
	{
		va_list argp;

		fprintf(stderr, "%s, line %d: error:", filename, lineno);
		va_start(argp, msg);
		vfprintf(stderr, msg, argp);
		va_end(argp);
		fprintf(stderr, "\n");
	}
</pre>
We declare a local variable of type <TT>va_list</TT>
and call <TT>va_start()</TT>,
as before.
However, all we do with our <TT>argp</TT> variable
is pass it to <TT>vfprintf</TT> as its third argument.
<TT>vfprintf</TT> then does all the work--if
we could look inside it,
it would look a lot like our version of <TT>printf</TT> above,
except that <TT>vfprintf</TT> does <em>not</em> call
<TT>va_start()</TT>,
because its caller already has.
Notice that <TT>vfprintf</TT> does <em>not</em> accept
a variable number of arguments;
it accepts exactly three arguments,
the third of which is essentially a ``pointer''
to the extra arguments it will need.
</p><p>There are also ``varargs'' versions of
<TT>printf</TT> and <TT>sprintf</TT>,
namely <TT>vprintf</TT> and <TT>vsprintf</TT>.
These follow the same pattern,
accepting a single last argument of type <TT>va_list</TT>
in lieu of an actual variable-length argument list.
</p><p>(Notice that the <TT>error</TT> function above
also called <TT>va_end()</TT>.
This makes sense,
since <TT>error</TT> was the one who called <TT>va_start()</TT>.
The above pattern works,
but more complicated ones may not.
For example,
it's not guaranteed that you can
pick a few arguments off of a <TT>va_list</TT>,
pass the <TT>va_list</TT> to a subfunction to pick a few more off,
and then pick the last ones off yourself.
Also, there's no direct way to ``rewind'' a <TT>va_list</TT>,
although it's permissible to call <TT>va_end()</TT>
and then <TT>va_start()</TT> again,
to start over again.)
