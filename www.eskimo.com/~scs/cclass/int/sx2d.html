<H2>16.4: Line Input and Output
(<TT>fgets</TT>, <TT>fputs</TT>, etc.)</H2>

<p>The function
<pre>
	char *gets(char *line)
</pre>
reads the next line of text
(i.e. up to the next <TT>\n</TT>)
from the standard input
and places the characters
(except for the <TT>\n</TT>)
in the character array

pointed to by <TT>line</TT>.
It returns a pointer to the line
(that is,
it returns the same pointer value you gave it),
unless it reaches end-of-file,
in which case it returns a null pointer.
It is assumed that <TT>line</TT> points to enough memory
to hold all of the characters read,
plus a terminating <TT>\0</TT>
(so that the line will be usable as a string).
Since there's usually no way for anyone to guarantee
that the array is big enough,
and no way
for <TT>gets</TT>
to check it,
<TT>gets</TT> is actually a useless function,
and no serious program should call it.
</p><p>The function
<pre>
	char *fgets(char *line, int max, FILE *fp)
</pre>
is somewhat more useful.
It reads the next line of input from the stream <TT>fp</TT>
and places the characters,
<em>including</em> the <TT>\n</TT>,
in the character array pointed to by <TT>line</TT>.
The second argument, <TT>max</TT>,
gives the maximum number of characters to be written to the array,
and is usually the size of the array.
Like <TT>gets</TT>,
<TT>fgets</TT> returns a pointer to the line it reads,
or a null pointer if it reaches end-of-file.

Unlike <TT>gets</TT>,
<TT>fgets</TT> does include the <TT>\n</TT>
in the string it copies to the array.
Therefore,
the number of characters in the line,
plus
the <TT>\n</TT>,
plus
the <TT>\0</TT>,
will always be less than or equal to <TT>max</TT>.
(If <TT>fgets</TT> reads <TT>max-1</TT> characters
without finding a <TT>\n</TT>,
it stops reading there,
copies a <TT>\0</TT> to the last element of the array,
and leaves the rest of the line to be read next time.)
Since <TT>fgets</TT> does let you guarantee
that the line being read won't go off the end of the array,
you should always use <TT>fgets</TT> instead of <TT>gets</TT>.
(If you want to read a line from standard input,
you can just pass the constant <TT>stdin</TT> as the third argument.)
If you'd rather not have the <TT>\n</TT> retained in the input line,
you can either remove it right after calling <TT>fgets</TT>
(perhaps by calling <TT>strchr</TT>
and overwriting the <TT>\n</TT> with a <TT>\0</TT>),
or maybe call the <TT>getline</TT> or <TT>fgetline</TT>

function we've been using instead.
(See chapters

6
and

12;
these functions are also handy
in that they return the length of the line read.
They differ from <TT>fgets</TT> in their treatment of overlong lines,
though.)
</p><p>The function
<pre>
	int puts(char *line)
</pre>
writes the string pointed to by <TT>line</TT> to the standard output,
and writes a <TT>\n</TT> to terminate it.
It returns a nonnegative value
(we don't really care what the value is)
unless there's some kind of a write error,
in which case it returns <TT>EOF</TT>.
</p><p>Finally,
the function
<pre>
	int fputs(char *line, FILE *fp)
</pre>
writes the string pointed to by <TT>line</TT>
to the stream <TT>fp</TT>.
Like <TT>puts</TT>,
<TT>fputs</TT> returns a nonnegative value
or <TT>EOF</TT> on error.
Unlike <TT>puts</TT>,
<TT>fputs</TT> does <em>not</em> automatically append a <TT>\n</TT>.
