<H2>17.2: Binary Data Files</H2>

<p>Normally,
when writing notes like these,
I progress from the easy to the hard,
or the boring to the interesting,
or the deficient to the recommended.
This chapter is the reverse;
I heartily recommend
that you use the text data files of the previous section
whenever possible.
This section on binary data files is included for completeness,
and you're welcome to skip it
if you're not interested in using binary data files
or if it doesn't make sense.
</p><p>We've already seen two examples
of writing and reading binary data files,
in section

16.7
of the previous chapter.
To write out an array of integers,
we called
<pre>
	fwrite(array, sizeof(int), na, fp);
</pre>
To read them back in,
we called
<pre>
	na = fread(array, sizeof(int), 10, fp);
</pre>
To write out a structure,
we called
<pre>
	fwrite(&amp;x, sizeof(struct s), 1, fp);
</pre>
To read it back in, we called
<pre>
	fread(&amp;x, sizeof(struct s), 1, fp);
</pre>
(which returns 1 if it succeeds).
</p><p>These examples certainly seem attractive:
they will result in compact data files,
they will probably be quite efficient,
and they are certainly simple for the programmer to write.
However,
data files created in this way fare quite badly
when evaluated against our other criteria.
They will not be human-readable;
they will contain sets of inscrutable byte values
which are exact copies of the memory regions
used to contain the data structures.
They will not be at all portable;
they cannot be correctly read
(at least, not with the simple calls to <TT>fread</TT>)
on machines where basic types such as <TT>int</TT> have different sizes,
or where the basic types are laid out differently in memory
(e.g. ``big endian'' vs. ``little endian'',
or different floating-point representations).

They may not even be able to be read by the same code
compiled under a different compiler on the same machine,
since different compilers may
use different sizes for integers,
or
lay out
the fields of structures
differently in memory.
(The fields will always be in the order you expect,
but different compilers may, for various reasons,
leave different amounts of empty space or ``padding''
between certain fields.)
These binary files will have no provision whatsoever
for backwards or forwards compatibility;
any change to the structure definition
will completely change the implied format of the data file,
with no hope of reading older (or newer) files.
The only other benefit these files have
is that if the data is for any reason sensitive,
it will certainly be a bit better concealed from prying eyes.
</p><p>We can get around these disadvantages of binary data files,
but in so doing we'll lose many of the advantages,
such as blinding efficiency or programmer convenience.
If we care about data file portability
or backwards or forwards compatibility,
we will have to write structures one field at a time,
not in one fell swoop.
Furthermore,
if we have an <TT>int</TT> to write,
we may choose not to write it using <TT>fwrite</TT>:
<pre>
	fwrite(&amp;i, sizeof(int), 1, fp);
</pre>
but rather a byte at a time, using <TT>putc</TT>:
<pre>
	putc(i / 256, fp);
	putc(i % 256, fp);
</pre>
In this way,
we'd have precise control over the order
in which the two halves of the <TT>int</TT> are being written.
(We're assuming here that there's no more than
two bytes' worth of data in the <TT>int</TT>,
which is a safe assumption
if we're portably assuming
that <TT>int</TT>s can only hold up to +-32767.)
When it came time to read the <TT>int</TT> back in,
we might do that a byte at a time, too:
<pre>
	i = getc(fp);
	i = 256 * i + getc(fp);
</pre>
(We could <em>not</em> collapse this to
<TT>i = 256 * getc(fp) + getc(fp)</TT>,
because we wouldn't know which order
the two calls to <TT>getc</TT> would occur in.)
</p><p>We might also choose to use tags
to mark the various ``fields'' within our binary data file;
the fields would be more likely to be byte codes
such as <TT>0x00</TT>, <TT>0x01</TT>, and <TT>0x02</TT>
than the character or string codes
we used in the tagged text data file of the previous section.
</p><p>If you do choose to use binary data files,
you <em>must</em> open them for writing with
<TT>fopen</TT> mode <TT>"wb"</TT>
and for reading with <TT>"rb"</TT>
(or perhaps one of the <TT>+</TT> modes;
the point is that you do need the <TT>b</TT>).
Remember that,
in the default mode,
the standard I/O functions all assume text files,
and translate between <TT>\n</TT>
and the operating system's end-of-line representation.
If you try to read or write a binary data file in text mode,
whenever
your internal data happens to contain a byte
which matches the code for <TT>\n</TT>,
or your external data happens to contain bytes
which match the operating system's end-of-line representation,
they may

be translated out from under you,
screwing up your data.
