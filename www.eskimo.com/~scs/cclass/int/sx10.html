<H1>Chapter 24: Pointers To Functions</H1>

<p>The pointers we have looked at so far
have all been pointers to various types of data objects,
but it is also possible to have pointers to functions.
Pointers to functions are useful
for approximately the same reasons as pointers to data:
when you want an extra level of indirection,
when you'd like the same piece of code
to call different functions depending on circumstances.
