<H3>18.1.7: Type Qualifiers</H3>

<p>[Type qualifiers are a fairly advanced feature
which not all programs need.
You may skip this section.]
</p><p>Any type can be qualified by the type qualifiers
<TT>const</TT> or <TT>volatile</TT>.
Both of these were new with ANSI C,
and
there is a lot of
older code
which
does not use them.
Even in new code, you will see <TT>const</TT> fairly rarely,
and <TT>volatile</TT> even less often.
</p><p>In simple declarations,
the type qualifier is simply another keyword in the type name,
along with the basic type and the storage class.
For example,
<pre>
	const int i;
	const float f;
	extern volatile unsigned long int ul;
</pre>
are all declarations involving type qualifiers.
</p><p>A <TT>const</TT> value is one you promise not to modify.
The compiler may therefore be able to make certain optimizations,
such as placing a <TT>const</TT>-qualified variable in read-only memory.
However,
a <TT>const</TT>-qualified variable is not a true constant;
that is, it does not qualify

as a <dfn>constant expression</dfn>
which C requires in certain situations,
such as array dimensions,
<TT>case</TT> labels
(see

section 18.3.1
below),
and initializers for variables with static duration
(globals and <TT>static</TT> locals).
</p><p>A <TT>volatile</TT> value

is one that might change unexpectedly.
This situation generally only arises
when you're directly accessing special hardware registers,
usually when writing device drivers.
The compiler should not assume that a <TT>volatile</TT>-qualified variable
contains the last value that was written to it,
or that reading it again would yield the same result
that reading it last time did.
The compiler should therefore avoid making any optimizations
which would
suppress seemingly-redundant
accesses to a <TT>volatile</TT>-qualified variable.
Examples of <TT>volatile</TT> locations would be a clock register
(which always gave an up-to-date time value each time you read it),
or a device control/status register,
which caused some peripheral device to perform an action
each time the register was written to.
</p><p>Type qualifiers become more interesting
(or at least more complicated or confusing)
when they modify pointer types.
The placement of the qualifier in a pointer declaration
determines whether it is the pointer itself,
or the location pointed to,
that is qualified.
The declarations
<pre>
	int const *ci1;
and
	const int *ci2;
</pre>
declare pointers to constant <TT>int</TT>s,
which means that although the pointers can be modified
(to point to different locations),
the locations pointed to
(that is, <TT>*ci1</TT> and <TT>*ci2</TT>)
can <em>not</em> be modified.
The declaration
<pre>
	int * const cp;
</pre>
on the other hand,
declares a pointer which cannot be modified
(it cannot be set to point anywhere else),
although the value it points to
(<TT>*cp</TT>)
can be modified.
</p><p>Pointers to constants
(such as <TT>ci1</TT> and <TT>ci2</TT> above)
have a particularly important use:
they can be used to document
(and enforce)
pointer parameters which a function promises <em>not</em> to use
to modify locations in the caller.
</p><p>Normally, C uses pass-by-value.
A function receives copies of its arguments,
which means that it cannot modify any variables in the caller
(since copies of those variables were passed).
If a function receives a pointer, however
(including the pointer that results
when the caller seems to ``pass'' an array),
it <em>can</em> use that pointer
(more precisely, it can
use its copy of the pointer)
to modify locations in the caller.
Sometimes, this is just what is desired:
when the caller ``passes'' an array
which it wishes the function to fill in,
or when the function wants to return one or more values via pointers
rather than as the conventional return value,
the function's modification of locations in the caller
is deliberate and understood by the caller.
However,
when a function receives a pointer argument for some other reason,
under circumstances in which the caller
might not want the function to use
the pointer to modify anything in the caller,
the caller might appreciate a guarantee
that the pointer
(within the function)
won't be used to modify anything.
To make that guarantee,
the function can declare
the pointer as
pointer-to-<TT>const</TT>.
</p><p>For example,
our old friend <TT>printf</TT>
never scribbles on the string
it's given
as its format argument;
it merely uses it to decide what to print.
Therefore, the prototype for <TT>printf</TT> is
<pre>
	int printf(const char *fmt, ...)
</pre>
where the <TT>...</TT> represents
<TT>printf</TT>'s optional arguments.
If a caller writes something like
<pre>
	char mystring[] = "Hello, world!\n";
	printf(mystring);
</pre>
it

knows, from <TT>printf</TT>'s prototype,
that <TT>printf</TT> won't be scribbling on <TT>mystring</TT>.
Furthermore,
with that prototype for <TT>printf</TT> in scope,
the actual author of the <TT>printf</TT> code
couldn't
accidentally write a (buggy) version
which inadvertently modified
the format argument--since
it's declared as <TT>const char *</TT>,
the compiler will complain
if any attempt is made to write to the location(s) it points to.
</p><p><TT>const</TT> and <TT>volatile</TT> can also be used in combination.
Theoretically, it's possible to have a single variable which is both:
<pre>
	const volatile int x;
</pre>
Also, both a pointer and what it points to can be qualified:
<pre>
	const char * const cpc;
</pre>
</p><p>Finally,
as in several other situations,
C tends to assume type <TT>int</TT>,
so if you want to save a bit of typing,
you can write
<pre>
	const i;
</pre>
instead of
<pre>
	const int i;
</pre>
etc.
