<H2>20.2 Nested Header Files</H2>

<p>Suppose you have written a little set of functions
which you expect that other parts of your program
(or other parts of <em>other</em> people's programs)
will call.
And, so that it will be easier for you
(and them)
to call the functions correctly,
suppose that you have written a header file
containing external prototype declarations for the functions.
And,
suppose that the prototypes look like this:
<pre>
	extern int f1(int);
	extern double f2(int, double);
	extern int f3(int, FILE *);
</pre>
You might put these three declarations in a file called <TT>funcs.h</TT>.
</p><p>For now,
we don't need to worry about
what these three functions
might
do,
other than
to notice
that <TT>f3</TT> obviously reads from or writes to
a <TT>FILE *</TT> stdio stream.
</p><p>Now, suppose that you have a source file
containing a function which calls <TT>f1</TT> and/or <TT>f2</TT>.
At the top of that source file,
you would put the line
<pre>
	#include "funcs.h"
</pre>
However,
if you were unlucky,
the compiler would get down to the line
<pre>
	extern int f3(int, FILE *);
</pre>
within <TT>funcs.h</TT> and complain,
because it would not know what a <TT>FILE</TT> is
and so would not know how to think about
a function that accepts a pointer to one.
If the calling program
(that is, the source file that included <TT>"funcs.h"</TT>)
didn't call <TT>f3</TT> or <TT>printf</TT> or <TT>fopen</TT>
or any of the other stdio functions,
it would have no reason to include <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>,
and <TT>FILE</TT> would remain undefined.
(If, on the other hand,
the source file in question did happen to include <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>,
and if it included it before it included <TT>"funcs.h"</TT>,
there would be no problem.)
</p><p>What's the right thing to do here?
We could say that anyone who included <TT>"funcs.h"</TT>
always had to include <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>, first.
But you can think of header files a little bit like you think of functions:
it's nice if they're ``black boxes'',
if you don't have to worry about what's inside them,
if you don't have to worry about including them in a certain order.
</p><p>Another way to think about the situation is this:
since the prototype for <TT>f3</TT> inside of <TT>funcs.h</TT>
needs stdio.h,
maybe we should put the line
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>
right there at the top of <TT>funcs.h</TT>!
Is that legal?
Can the preprocessor handle
seeing an <TT>#include</TT> directive
when it's already in the middle
of processing another <TT>#include</TT> directive?
The answer is that yes, it can;
header files
(that is, <TT>#include</TT> directives)
may be nested.
(They may be nested up to a depth of at least 8,
although many compilers probably allow more.)
Once <TT>funcs.h</TT> takes care of its own needs,
by including <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> itself,
the eventual top-level file
(that is, the one you compile,
the one that includes <TT>"funcs.h"</TT>)
won't get error messages about <TT>FILE</TT> being undefined,
and won't have to worry about
whether it includes <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> or not.
</p><p>Or will it?
What if the top-level source file
<em>does</em> include <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>?
Now <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> will end up being processed twice,
once when the top-level source file asks for it,
and once when <TT>funcs.h</TT> asks for it.
Will everything work correctly
if <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> is included twice?
Again, the answer is yes;
the Standard requires that the standard header files
protect themselves against multiple inclusion.
</p><p>It's good that the standard header files are protected in this way.
But how do they protect themselves?
Suppose that we'd like to protect our own header files
(such as <TT>funcs.h</TT>)
in the same sort of way.
How would we do it?
</p><p>Here's the usual trick.
We rewrite <TT>funcs.h</TT> like this:
<pre>
	#ifndef FUNCS_H
	#define FUNCS_H

	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

	extern int f1(int);
	extern double f2(int, double);
	extern int f3(int, FILE *);

	#endif
</pre>
All we've done is
added the <TT>#ifndef</TT> and <TT>#define</TT> lines at the top,
and the <TT>#endif</TT> line at the bottom.
(The macro name <TT>FUNCS_H</TT> doesn't really mean anything,
it's just one we don't
and won't
use anywhere else,
so we
use the convention
of having
its name mimic the name of the header file we're protecting.)
Now, here's what happens:
the first time the compiler processes <TT>funcs.h</TT>,
it comes across the line
<pre>
	#ifndef FUNCS_H
</pre>
and <TT>FUNCS_H</TT> is not defined,
so it proceeds.
The very next thing it does
is to <TT>#define</TT> the macro <TT>FUNCS_H</TT>
(with a replacement text of nothing, but that's okay,
because we're never going to expand <TT>FUNCS_H</TT>,
just test whether it's defined or not).
Then it processes the rest of <TT>funcs.h</TT>, as usual.
But,
if that same run of the compiler ever
comes across <TT>funcs.h</TT> for a second time,
when it comes to the first <TT>#ifndef FUNCS_H</TT> line again,
<TT>FUNCS_H</TT> <em>will</em> at that point be defined,
so the preprocessor will skip down to the <TT>#endif</TT> line,
which will skip the whole header file.
Nothing in the file will be processed a second time.
</p><p>(You might wonder what would tend to go wrong
if a header file were processed multiple times.
It's okay to issue
multiple external declarations for the same function or global variable,
as long as they're all consistent,
so those wouldn't cause any problems.
And the preprocessor also isn't supposed to complain
if you <TT>#define</TT> a macro which is already defined,
as long as it has the same value,
that is,
the same replacement text.
But the compiler <em>will</em> complain
if you try to define a structure type you've already defined,
or a typedef you've already defined
(see section 18.1.6),
etc.
So the protection against multiple inclusion
is important in the general case.)
</p><p>When header files are protected against multiple inclusion
by the <TT>#ifndef</TT> trick,
then header files can include other files
to get the declarations and definitions they need,
and no errors will arise because one file forgot to
(or didn't know that it had to)
include one header before another,
and no multiple-definition errors will arise because of multiple inclusion.
I recommend this technique.
</p><p>In closing, though,
I might mention that this technique is
somewhat controversial.
When header files include other header files,
it can be hard to track down the chain of who includes what
and who defines what,
if for some reason you need to know.
Therefore,
some style guides disallow nested header files.
(I don't know how these style guides recommend that you
address the issue of having to require
that certain files be included before others.)
