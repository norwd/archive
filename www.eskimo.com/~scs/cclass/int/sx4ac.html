<H3>18.3.1: <TT>switch</TT></H3>

<p>[This section corresponds to K&amp;R Sec. 3.4]
</p><p>A frequent sort of pattern is exemplified by
the sequence
<pre>
	if(x == e1)
		/* some code */
	else if(x == e2)
		/* other code */
	else if(x == e3)
		/* some more code */
	else if(x == e4)
		/* yet more code */
	else
		/* default code */
</pre>
Depending on the value of <TT>x</TT>,
we have one of several chunks of code to execute,
which we select with a long
<TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT>/<TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT>... chain.
When the value we're selecting on is an integer,
and when the values we're selecting among are all constant,
we can use a <TT>switch</TT> statement, instead.
The <TT>switch</TT> statement evaluates an expression
and matches the result against a series of
``<TT>case</TT> labels''.
The code
beginning
with the matching <TT>case</TT> label (if any) is executed.
A <TT>switch</TT> statement can also have a <TT>default</TT> case
which is executed if none of the explicit <TT>case</TT>s match.
</p><p>A <TT>switch</TT> statement looks like this:
<pre>
	switch( <I>expr</I> )
		{
		case <I>c1</I> :
			<I>... code ...</I>
			break;
		case <I>c2</I> :
			<I>... code ...</I>
			break;
		case <I>c3</I> :
			<I>... code ...</I>
			break;
		...
		default:
			<I>... code ...</I>
			break;
		}
</pre>
The expression <I>expr</I>
is evaluated.
If one of the <TT>case</TT> labels
(<I>c1</I>, <I>c2</I>, <I>c3</I>, etc.,
which must all be integral constants)
matches,
execution jumps to there,
and continues
until
the
next
<TT>break</TT> statement.
Otherwise,
if there is a <TT>default</TT> label,
execution jumps to there
(and continues to the
next
<TT>break</TT> statement).
Otherwise,
none of the code in the <TT>switch</TT> statement is executed.
(Yes, the <TT>break</TT> statement is also used to break out of loops.
It breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop
or <TT>switch</TT> statement it finds itself in.)
</p><p>The <TT>switch</TT> statement only works on
integral arguments and expressions
(<TT>char</TT>, the various sizes of <TT>int</TT>,
and <TT>enum</TT>s,
though we haven't met <TT>enum</TT>s yet).
There is no direct way to switch on strings,
or on floating-point values.
The target <TT>case</TT> labels must be specified explicitly;
there is no general way to
specify a case which
corresponds to
a range of values.
</p><p>One peculiarity of the <TT>switch</TT> statement
is that the <TT>break</TT>
at the end of one case's block of code
is
optional.
If you leave it out, control will ``fall through''
from one case to the next.
Occasionally, this is what you want, but usually not,
so remember to put a <TT>break</TT> statement after most cases.
(Since falling through is so rare,
many programmers highlight it,
when they do
mean to
use it,
with a comment like <TT>/* FALL THROUGH */</TT>,
to indicate that it's not a mistake.)
One way to make use of ``fallthrough''
is when you have a small set or range of cases
which should all map to the same code.
Since the <TT>case</TT> labels are just labels,
and since there doesn't have to be a statement
immediately following a <TT>case</TT> label,
you can associate several <TT>case</TT> labels with one block of
code:
<pre>
	switch(x)
		{
		case 1:
			<I>... code ...</I>
			break;
		case 2:
			<I>... code ...</I>
			break;
		case 3:
		case 4:
		case 5:
			<I>... code ...</I>
			break;
		default:
			<I>... code ...</I>
			break;
		}
</pre>
Here, the same chunk of code is executed when <TT>x</TT> is 3, 4, or 5.
</p><p>The <TT>case</TT> labels do not have to be in any particular order;
the compiler is smart enough to find the matching one if it's
there.
The <TT>default</TT> case doesn't have to go at the end, either.
</p><p>It's common to switch on characters:
<pre>
	switch(c)
		{
		case '+':
			/* code for + */
			break;
		case '-':
			/* code for - */
			break;
		case '\n':
			/* code for newline */
			/* FALL THROUGH */
		case ' ':
		case '\t':
			/* code for other whitespace */
			break;
		case '0': case '1': case '2': case '3': case '4':
		case '5': case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9':
			/* code for digits */
			break;
		default:
			/* code for all other characters */
			break;
		}
</pre>
It's also common to have a set of <TT>#define</TT>d values,
and to switch on those:
<pre>
	#define APPLE    1
	#define ORANGE   2
	#define CHERRY   3
	#define BROCCOLI 4

	...

	switch(fruit)
		{
		case APPLE:
			printf("turnover"); break;
		case ORANGE:
			printf("marmalade"); break;
		case CHERRY:
			printf("pie"); break;
		case BROCCOLI:
			printf("wait a minute... that's not a fruit"); break;
		}
