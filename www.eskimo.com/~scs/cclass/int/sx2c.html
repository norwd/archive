<H2>16.3: Character Input and Output
(<TT>getchar</TT>, <TT>putchar</TT>, etc.)</H2>

<p>Character-at-a-time input and output is simple and straightforward.
The <TT>getchar</TT> function
reads the next character from the standard input;
<TT>getc(fp)</TT> reads the next character from the stream <TT>fp</TT>.
Both return the next character or,
if the next character can't be read,
the non-character constant <TT>EOF</TT>,
which is defined in <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>.
(Usually the reason that the next character can't be read
is that the input stream has reached end-of-file,
but it's also possible that there's been some I/O error.)
Since the value <TT>EOF</TT> is distinct from all character values,
it's important that the return value
from <TT>getc</TT> and <TT>getchar</TT>
be assigned to a variable of type <TT>int</TT>,
not <TT>char</TT>.
Don't declare the variable to hold
<TT>getc</TT>'s or <TT>getchar</TT>'s return value
as a <TT>char</TT>;
don't try to read characters
directly into a character array with code like
<pre>
	while(i &lt; max &amp;&amp; (a[i] = getc(fp)) != EOF)	/* WRONG, for char a[] */
</pre>
The code may seem to work at first,
but some day it will get confused
when it reads a real character
with a value
which seems to equal that which results
when the non-<TT>char</TT> value <TT>EOF</TT>
is crammed into a <TT>char</TT>.
</p><p>One more reminder about <TT>getchar</TT>:
although it returns and therefore seems to read one character at a time,
it typically delivers characters from internal buffers
which may hold more characters which will be delivered later.
For example,
most command-line-based operating systems
let you type an entire line of input,
and wait for you to type the RETURN or ENTER key
before making any of those characters available to a program
(even if the program thought
it was doing character-at-a-time input with
calls to
<TT>getchar</TT>).
There are, of course,
ways to read characters immediately
(without waiting for the RETURN key),
but they differ from operating system to operating system.
</p><p>Writing single characters is just as easy
as reading:
<TT>putchar(c)</TT> writes the character <TT>c</TT> to standard output;
<TT>putc(c, fp)</TT> writes the character <TT>c</TT> to the stream <TT>fp</TT>.
(The character <TT>c</TT> must be a real character.
If you want to ``send'' an end-of-file condition to a stream,
that is,
cause the program reading the stream to ``get'' end-of-file,
you do that by closing the stream,
not by trying to write <TT>EOF</TT> to it.)
</p><p>Occasionally,
when reading characters,
you sometimes find that you've
read a bit too far.
For example,
if one part of your code is supposed to read a
number--a string of digits--from
a file,
leaving the characters after the digits on the input stream
for some
other part of the program to read,
the digit-reading part of the program won't know that it has read 
all the digits until it has read a non-digit,
at which point it's too late.
(The situation recalls Dave Barry's recipe for
``food heated up'':
``Put the food in a pot on the stove on medium heat
until just before the kitchen fills with black smoke.'')
When reading characters with the standard I/O library, at least, 
we have an escape:
the <TT>ungetc</TT> function ``un-reads'' one 
character,
pushing it back on the input stream for a later call to 
<TT>getc</TT> (or some other input function) to read.
The prototype for <TT>ungetc</TT> is
<pre>
	int ungetc(int c, FILE *fp)
</pre>
where <TT>c</TT> is the character
which is to be pushed back onto the stream <TT>fp</TT>.
For example, here is a code scrap that reads digits from a stream
(and converts them to the corresponding integer),
stopping at the first non-digit character and leaving it on the input stream:
<pre>
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

int c, n = 0;
while((c = getchar()) != EOF &amp;&amp; isdigit(c))
	n = 10 * n + (c - '0');
if(c != EOF)
	ungetc(c, stdin);
</pre>
It's only guaranteed that you can push one character back,
but that's usually all you need.
