<H1>Chapter 19: Returning Arrays</H1>

<p>Arrays are ``second-class citizens'' in C.
Related to the fact that arrays can't be assigned
is the fact that
they can't be returned by functions, either;
that is,
there is no such type as ``function returning array of ...''.
In this chapter we'll study three workarounds,
three ways to implement a function
which attempts to return a string
(that is, an array of <TT>char</TT>)
or an array of some other type.
</p><p>In the last chapter, we looked at some code for converting an integer
into a string of digits representing its value.
This operation is the inverse of the function performed
by the standard function <TT>atoi</TT>.
Suppose we wanted to wrap our digit-generating code
up in a function and call it <TT>itoa</TT>.
How would it return the generated string of digits?
We'll use this example to demonstrate all three techniques.
For simplicity, though,
we won't repeat the <TT>do</TT>/<TT>while</TT> loop
in each example function;
instead, we'll simply call <TT>sprintf</TT>.
(In fact, since calling <TT>sprintf</TT> is so easy,
most C programs call it directly when they need to
convert integers to strings,
and consequently there is no standard <TT>itoa</TT> function.)
</p><p>First, let's look at the way that <em>won't</em> work,
so that we can set it aside and make sure we never use it.
What if we wrote <TT>itoa</TT> like this?
<pre>
	char *itoa(int n)
	{
	char retbuf[25];
	sprintf(retbuf, "%d", n);
	return retbuf;
	}
</pre>
This looks superficially reasonable,
and it might well be what we'd write at first if we weren't
being careful.
(It might even seem to work, at first.)
However, it has a serious, fatal flaw:
let's think about that local array, <TT>retbuf</TT>.
Since it's a regular local variable,
it has <dfn>automatic</dfn> duration,
which means that it springs into existence when the function is called
<em>and disappears when the function returns</em>.
Therefore,
the pointer that this version of <TT>itoa</TT> returns
is to an array which no longer exists by the time the caller
receives the pointer.
(Remember that the statement <TT>return retbuf;</TT>
returns a pointer to the first character in <TT>retbuf</TT>;
by the ``equivalence of arrays and pointers,''
the mention of the array <TT>retbuf</TT> in this context
is equivalent to <TT>&amp;retbuf[0]</TT>.)
When the caller tries to use the pointer,
the string
created
by <TT>itoa</TT> might still be there,
or the memory might have been re-used by some other function.
Therefore, this first version of <TT>itoa</TT> is <em>not</em>
adequate and <em>not</em> acceptable.
Functions must never return pointers to local,
automatic-duration arrays.
</p><p>Since the problem with returning a pointer to a local array
is that the array has automatic duration by default,
the simplest fix to the above non-functional version of <TT>itoa</TT>,
and the first of our three working methods of returning arrays from functions,
is to declare the array <TT>static</TT>, instead:
<pre>
	char *itoa(int n)
	{
	static char retbuf[25];
	sprintf(retbuf, "%d", n);
	return retbuf;
	}
</pre>
Now, the <TT>retbuf</TT> array does not disappear when <TT>itoa</TT>
returns, so the pointer is still valid by the time the caller uses it.
</p><p>Returning a pointer to a <TT>static</TT> array
is a practical and popular solution
to the problem of ``returning'' an array,
but it has one drawback.
Each time you call the function,
it re-uses the same array and returns the same pointer.
Therefore,
when you call the function a second time,
whatever information it ``returned'' to you last time
will be overwritten.
(More precisely, the information,
that the function returned a pointer to,
will be overwritten.)
For example,
suppose we had occasion
to save the pointer returned by <TT>itoa</TT> for a little while,
with the intention of using it later,
after calling <TT>itoa</TT> again in the meantime:
<pre>
	int i = 23;
	char *p1, *p2;
	p1 = itoa(i);
	i = i + 10;
	p2 = itoa(i);
	printf("old i = %s, new i = %s\n", p1, p2);
</pre>
But this won't work as we
expect--the
second call to <TT>itoa</TT> will overwrite the string
(stored in <TT>itoa</TT>'s
static
<TT>retbuf</TT> array)
which was stored by the first call.
Instead of printing <TT>i</TT>'s old and new value,
the last line will print the new value, twice.
Both <TT>p1</TT> and <TT>p2</TT> will point to the same place,
to the <TT>retbuf</TT> array down inside <TT>itoa</TT>,
because each call to <TT>itoa</TT> always returns
the same pointer to that same array.
</p><p>We can see the same problem in an even simpler example.
Suppose we had never heard of
the <TT>%d</TT> format specifier in <TT>printf</TT>.
We might try to call something like this:
<pre>
	printf("i = %s, j = %s\n", itoa(i), itoa(j));
</pre>
where <TT>i</TT> and <TT>j</TT> are
two different <TT>int</TT> variables.
What will happen?
Either the compiler will make
the first call to <TT>itoa</TT> first,
or the second.
(It turns out that it's not specified
which order the compiler will use;
different compilers behave differently in this respect.)
Whichever call to <TT>itoa</TT> happens <em>second</em>
will be the one that
gets to keep its return value in
<TT>retbuf</TT>.
The <TT>printf</TT> call will either print <TT>i</TT>'s value twice,
or <TT>j</TT>'s value twice,
but it won't be able to print two distinct values.
</p><p>The moral is that
although the <TT>static</TT> return array technique will work,
the caller has to be a little bit careful,
and must never expect the return pointer from one call to the function
to be usable after a later call to the function.
Sometimes this restriction is a real problem;
other times it's perfectly acceptable.
(Some of the functions in the standard C library use this technique;
one example is <TT>ctime</TT>,
which converts timestamp values to printable strings.
When you see a cryptic sentence like
``The returned pointer is to static data
which is overwritten with each call''
in the documentation for a library function,
it means that the function is using this technique.)
When this restriction <em>would</em> be too onerous on the caller,
we should use one of the other two techniques, described next.
</p><p>If the function can't use a local or local <TT>static</TT> array
to hold the return value,
the next option is to have the <em>caller</em> allocate an array,
and use that.
In this case,
the function accepts
at least one additional argument
(in addition to any data to be operated on):
a pointer to the location to write the result back to.
Our familiar <TT>getline</TT> function has worked this way all along.
If we rewrote <TT>itoa</TT>
along these lines,
it might look like this:
<pre>
	char *itoa(int n, char buf[])
	{
	sprintf(buf, "%d", n);
	return buf;
	}
</pre>
Now the caller must pass an <TT>int</TT> value to be converted
<em>and</em> an array to hold the converted result:
<pre>
	int i = 23;
	char buf[25];
	char *str = itoa(i, buf);
</pre>
There are two differences between this
version of <TT>itoa</TT> and our old <TT>getline</TT> function.
(Well, three, really;
of course
the two functions do totally different things.)
One difference is that
<TT>getline</TT> accepted another extra argument
which was the <em>size</em> of the array in the caller,
so that <TT>getline</TT> could promise not to overflow that array.
Our latest version of <TT>itoa</TT> does not accept such an argument,
which is a deficiency.
If the caller ever passes an array
which is too small to hold all the digits of the converted integer,
<TT>itoa</TT> (actually, <TT>sprintf</TT>)
will sail off the end of the array
and scribble on some other part of memory.
(Needless to say, this can be a disaster.)
</p><p>Another difference is that the return value
of this latest version of <TT>itoa</TT>
isn't terribly useful.
The pointer which this version of <TT>itoa</TT> returns
is always the same as the pointer you handed it.
Even if this version of <TT>itoa</TT> didn't return anything
as its formal return value,
you could still get your hands on the string it created,
since it would be sitting right there in your own array
(the one that you passed
to
<TT>itoa</TT>).
In the case of <TT>getline</TT>,
we had a second thing to return as the formal return value,
namely the length of the line we'd just read.
</p><p>However, this second strategy is also popular and workable.
Besides our own <TT>getline</TT> function,
the standard library functions <TT>fgets</TT> and <TT>fread</TT>
both use this technique.
</p><p>When the limit of a single static return array within the function
would be unacceptable,
and when it would be a nuisance for the caller
to have to declare or otherwise allocate return arrays,
a third option
is for the function to dynamically allocate some memory
for the returned array
by calling <TT>malloc</TT>.
Here is our last version of <TT>itoa</TT>,
demonstrating this technique:
<pre>
	char *itoa(int n)
	{
	char *retbuf = malloc(25);
	if(retbuf == NULL)
		return NULL;
	sprintf(retbuf, "%d", n);
	return retbuf;
	}
</pre>
Now the caller can go back to saying simple things like
<pre>
	char *p = itoa(i);
</pre>
and it no longer has to worry about the possibility that
a later call to <TT>itoa</TT>
will overwrite the results of the first.
However, the caller now has two <em>new</em> things to worry about:
<OL><li>This version of <TT>itoa</TT> returns a null pointer if
<TT>malloc</TT> fails to return the memory that <TT>itoa</TT> needs.
The caller should really be checking for this null pointer return
each time it calls <TT>itoa</TT>,
before using the pointer.
<li>If the caller calls <TT>itoa</TT> 10,000 times,
we'll have allocated
25 <TT>*</TT> 10,000 = 250,000 bytes of memory,
or a quarter of a meg.
Unless someone is careful to call <TT>free</TT>
to deallocate all of that memory,
it will be wasted.
Few programs can afford to waste that much memory.
(Once upon a time,
few programs could get that much memory, period.)
The ``someone''
who is going to have to call <TT>free</TT>
isn't <TT>itoa</TT>;
it has no idea when the caller is done
with the memory returned by a previous call to <TT>itoa</TT>,
and in fact <TT>itoa</TT> might never get called again.
So it will be the caller's responsibility
to keep track of each pointer returned by <TT>itoa</TT>,
and to free it when it's no longer needed,
or else memory will gradually leak away.
</OL>We can work around the first problem--if
we expect that there will usually be enough memory,
such that the call to <TT>malloc</TT> will rarely if ever fail,
and if all the caller would do in an out-of-memory situation is
print an error message and abort,
we can move the test down into the function:
<pre>
	char *retbuf = malloc(25);
	if(retbuf == NULL)
		{
		fprintf(stderr, "out of memory\n");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
		}
</pre>
Now the function never returns a null pointer,
so the caller doesn't have to check.
(When <TT>malloc</TT> fails, the function doesn't return at all.)
</p><p></p><p>In summary, we've seen three ways
of ``returning'' arrays from functions,
none of which is perfect.
The <TT>static</TT> array technique is usually convenient for the caller,
but only for functions
which it's unlikely that the caller will be trying to call multiple times
and retain multiple return values.
(The <TT>static</TT> array technique is also definitely imperfect
in that it violates the notion
that calling code shouldn't need to know
about the inner, implementation details of a called function.)
The caller-passes-an-array technique
is useful when the caller might have a number of calls to the function active,
but when that number is small and fixed,
so that the caller can easily declare and keep track
of a number of return arrays
(if necessary).
Finally,
when there might be an arbitrary number of calls to the function,
or when maximum flexibility is otherwise needed,
the function-calls-<TT>malloc</TT> technique is appropriate,
but with its extra flexibility comes some costs,
the most important of which is that the caller must remember to
free the returned pointers.
