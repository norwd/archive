<H2>16.9: Random Access
(<TT>fseek</TT>, <TT>ftell</TT>, etc.)</H2>

<p>Normally, files and streams
(that is, anything accessed via a <TT>FILE *</TT>)
are read and written sequentially.
However, it's also possible to jump to a certain position in a file.
</p><p>To jump to a position,
it's generally necessary to have ``been there'' once already.
First,
you use the function <TT>ftell</TT>
to find out what your position in the file is;
then, later,
you can use the function <TT>fseek</TT> to get back to a saved position.
</p><p>File positions are stored as <TT>long int</TT>s.
To record a position, you would use code like
<pre>
	long int pos;
	pos = ftell(fp);
</pre>
Later, you could ``seek'' back to that position with
<pre>
	fseek(fp, pos, SEEK_SET);
</pre>
The third argument to <TT>fseek</TT> is a code telling it
(in this case)
to set the position with respect to the beginning of the file;
this is the mode of operation you need when you're seeking to a 
position returned by <TT>ftell</TT>.
</p><p>As an example, suppose we were writing a file, and one of the 
lines in it contained the words ``This file is <I>n</I> 
lines long'',
where <I>n</I> was supposed to be replaced by the actual number 
of lines in the file.
At the time when we wrote that line, we might not know how many 
lines we'd eventually write.
We could resolve the difficulty by writing a placeholder line, 
remembering where it was, and then going back and filling in the 
right number later.
The first part of the code might look like this:
<pre>
	long int nlinespos = ftell(fp);
	fprintf(fp, "This file is %4d lines long\n", 0);
</pre>
Later, when we'd written the last line to the file,
we could seek back and rewrite the ``number-of-lines'' line 
like this:
<pre>
	fseek(fp, nlinespos, SEEK_SET);
	fprintf(fp, "This file is %4d lines long\n", nlines);
</pre>
There's no way to insert or delete characters in a file after the fact,
so we have to make sure that if we overwrite part of a file in this way,
the overwritten text is exactly the same length as the previous text.

That's why we used <TT>%4d</TT>,
so that the number would always be printed in a field 4 characters wide.
(However,
since the field width
in a <TT>printf</TT> format specifier
is a <em>minimum</em> width,
with this choice of width,
the code would fail if a file ever had more than 9999 lines in it.)
</p><p>Three other file-positioning functions are 
<TT>rewind</TT>, 
which rewinds a file to its beginning,
and <TT>fgetpos</TT> and <TT>fsetpos</TT>,
which are like <TT>ftell</TT> and <TT>fseek</TT> except that 
they record positions in a special type, 
<TT>fpos_t</TT>,
which may be able to record positions in huge files for which 
even a <TT>long int</TT> might not be sufficient.
</p><p>If you're ever using one of the ``read/write'' modes
(<TT>"r+"</TT> or <TT>"w+"</TT>),
you must use a call to a file-positioning function
(<TT>fseek</TT>, <TT>rewind</TT>, or <TT>fsetpos</TT>)
before switching from reading to writing or vice versa.
(You can also call <TT>fflush</TT>
while writing
and then switch
to reading,
or reach end-of-file
while reading
and then switch
back
to writing.)
</p><p>In binary (<TT>"b"</TT>) mode,
the file positions returned by <TT>ftell</TT> and used by <TT>fseek</TT>
are byte offsets,
such that it's possible to compute an <TT>fseek</TT> target
without having to have it returned by an earlier call to <TT>ftell</TT>.
On many systems
(including Unix, the Macintosh, and to some extent MS-DOS),
file positioning works this way in text mode as well.
Code that
relies on
this

isn't as portable,
though,
so it's not a good idea
to treat <TT>ftell</TT>/<TT>fseek</TT> positions
in text files
as byte offsets
unless you really have to.
