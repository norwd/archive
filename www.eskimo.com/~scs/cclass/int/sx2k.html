<H2>16.11: Redirection (<TT>freopen</TT>)</H2>

<p>For some programs,
standard input and standard output are enough,
and these programs can get by using just
<TT>getchar</TT>, <TT>putchar</TT>, <TT>printf</TT>, etc.,
and letting any input/output redirection be handled
by the user and the operating system
(perhaps using command-line redirection such as <TT>&lt;</TT> and <TT>&gt;</TT>).
Other programs handle all file manipulation themselves,
opening files with <TT>fopen</TT> and maintaining file pointer
(<TT>FILE *</TT>) variables recording the streams to which all 
input and output is done
(with <TT>getc</TT>, <TT>putc</TT>, <TT>fprintf</TT>, etc.).
</p><p>Occasionally,
a program has to be rewritten in a hurry,
to allow it to read or write a named file
without manipulating file pointers and changing
every call to <TT>getchar</TT> to <TT>getc</TT>,
every call to <TT>printf</TT> to <TT>fprintf</TT>, etc.
In these cases, the function <TT>freopen</TT> comes in handy:
it reopens an existing stream on a new file.
The prototype is
<pre>
	FILE *freopen(char *filename, char *mode, FILE *fp)
</pre>
<TT>freopen</TT> is about like <TT>fopen</TT>,
except that rather than allocating a new stream,
it uses
(and returns)
the caller-supplied stream <TT>fp</TT>.
For example,
to redirect a program's output to a file ``from within,''
you could call
<pre>
	freopen(filename, "w", stdout);
</pre>
</p><p>A disadvantage of <TT>freopen</TT>
is that there's generally no way to undo it;
you can't
change your mind later and
make <TT>stdin</TT> or <TT>stdout</TT> go back to where they had been
before you called <TT>freopen</TT>.
In situations where you want to be able to swich back and forth between streams,
it's much better if you <em>can</em> chase down and
change
every call to <TT>getchar</TT> to <TT>getc</TT>,
every call to <TT>printf</TT> to <TT>fprintf</TT>, etc.,
and then use some <TT>FILE *</TT> variable under your control
(typically with a name like <TT>ifp</TT> or <TT>ofp</TT>)
so that you can set it

to point to a file by calling <TT>fopen</TT>,
and later back to <TT>stdin</TT> or <TT>stdout</TT> by simply reassigning it.
