<H2>24.1 Declaring, Assigning, and Using Function Pointers</H2>

<p>Just as for data pointers,
we can think of three steps involved in using function pointers.
First,
we must declare a variable which can hold a pointer to a function,
and this ends up being a somewhat complex declaration.
A simple function pointer declaration looks like this:
<pre>
	int (*pfi)();
</pre>
This declares <TT>pfi</TT> as a
pointer to a function which will return an <TT>int</TT>.
As in other declarations,
the <TT>*</TT> indicates that a pointer is involved,
and the parentheses <TT>()</TT> indicate that a function is involved.
But what about the extra parentheses around <TT>(*pfi)</TT>?
They're needed because there are precedence relationships
in declarations just as there are in expressions,
and when the default precedence doesn't give you what you want,
you have to override it with explicit parentheses.
In declarations,
the <TT>()</TT> indicating functions
and the <TT>[]</TT> indicating arrays
``bind'' more tightly than
the <TT>*</TT>'s indicating pointers.
Without the extra parentheses, the declaration above would look like
<pre>
	int *pfi();		/* WRONG, for pointer-to-function */
</pre>
and this would declare a function returning a pointer to <TT>int</TT>.
With the explicit parentheses, however,
<TT>int (*pfi)()
</TT>tells us that <TT>pfi</TT> is a pointer first,
and that what it's a pointer to is a function,
and what that function returns is an <TT>int</TT>.
</p><p>It's common to use typedefs
(see

section 18.1.6)
with complicated types such as function pointers.
For example,
after defining
<pre>
	typedef int (*funcptr)();
</pre>
the identifier <TT>funcptr</TT> is now a synonym
for the type ``pointer to function returning int''.
This typedef would make
declaring pointers such as <TT>pfi</TT> considerably easier:
<pre>
	funcptr pfi;
</pre>
(In

section 18.1.6,
we mentioned that typedefs were a little bit like preprocessor 
<TT>define</TT> directives, but better.
Here we see another
reason:
there's no way we could define a preprocessor macro which would
expand to a correct function pointer declaration,
but the <TT>funcptr</TT> type we just defined using <TT>typedef</TT>
will work just fine.)
</p><p>Once declared,
a function pointer can of course be set to point to some function.
If we declare some functions:
<pre>
	extern int f1();
	extern int f2();
	extern int f3();
</pre>
then we can set our pointer <TT>pfi</TT> to point to one of them:
<pre>
	pfi = &amp;f1;
</pre>
or to one or another of them depending on some condition:
<pre>
	if(condition)
		pfi = &amp;f2;
	else	pfi = &amp;f3;
</pre>
(Of course, we're not restricted to these two forms;
we can assign function pointers under any circumstances we wish.
The second example could be rendered more compactly
using the conditional operator:
<TT>pfi = condition ? &amp;f2 : &amp;f3</TT> .)
</p><p>In these examples, we've used the <TT>&amp;</TT> operator
as we always have,
to generate a pointer.
However, when generating pointers to functions,
the <TT>&amp;</TT> is optional,
because when you mention the name of a function but are not calling it,
there's nothing else you could possibly be trying to do except
generate a pointer to it.
So, most programmers write
<pre>
	pfi = f1;
</pre>
or
<pre>
	if(condition)
		pfi = f2;
	else	pfi = f3;
</pre>
(or, equivalently,
using the conditional operator,
<TT>pfi = condition ? f2 : f3</TT> ).
</p><p>(The fact that a function pointer is generated automatically
when a function appears in an expression but is not being called
is very similar to, and in fact related to,
the fact that a pointer to the first element of an array
is generated automatically when an array appears in an expression.)
</p><p>Finally,
once we have a function pointer variable
which does point to a function,
we can call the function that it points to.
Broken down to a near-microscopic level,
this, too,
is a three-step procedure.
First,
we write the name of the function pointer variable:
<pre>
	  pfi
</pre>
This is a pointer to a function.
Then, we put the <TT>*</TT> operator in front,
to ``take the contents of the pointer'':
<pre>
	 *pfi
</pre>
Now we have a function.
Finally, we append an argument list in parentheses,
along with an extra set of parentheses to get the precedence right,
and we have a function call:
<pre>
	(*pfi)(arg1, arg2)
</pre>
The extra parentheses are needed here
for almost exactly the same reason
as they were in the declaration of <TT>pfi</TT>.
Without them,
we'd have
<pre>
	*pfi(arg1, arg2)	/* WRONG, for pointer-to-function */
</pre>
and this would say,
``call the function <TT>pfi</TT>
(which had better return a pointer),
passing it the arguments <TT>arg1</TT> and <TT>arg2</TT>,
and take the contents of the pointer it returns.''
However,
what we want to do is take the contents of <TT>pfi</TT>
(which is a pointer to a function)
and
call the pointed-to function,
passing it the arguments <TT>arg1</TT> and <TT>arg2</TT>.
Again, the explicit parentheses override the default precedence,
arranging that we apply the <TT>*</TT> operator to <TT>pfi</TT>
and <em>then</em> do the function call.
</p><p>Just to confuse things,
though,
parts of the syntax are optional here as well.
There's nothing you can do with a function pointer
except assign it to another function pointer,
compare it to another function pointer,
or call the function that it points to.
If you write
<pre>
	pfi(arg1, arg2)
</pre>
it's obvious,
based on the parenthesized argument list,
that you're trying to call a function,
so the compiler goes ahead and calls the pointed to function,
just as if you'd written
<pre>
	(*pfi)(arg1, arg2)
</pre>
When calling the function pointed to by a function pointer,
the <TT>*</TT> operator
(and hence the extra set of parentheses)
is optional.
I prefer to use the explicit <TT>*</TT>,
because that's the way I learned it
and it makes a bit more sense to me that way,
but you'll
also
see code which leaves it

out.
