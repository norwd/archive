<H2>2.1. Command Line Environment</H2>

<p>In a command line environment,
steps 1, 2, and 3 all involve separate commands
you type at your prompt
(often <TT>$</TT> or <TT>%</TT> under Unix,
<TT>C:\&gt;</TT> under MS-DOS).
To type your program's source code in for the first time,
or make changes to it,
you'll invoke the text editor of your choice.
(If possible, you'll want to use a plain text editor
in preference to a fancier word processor;
a word processor's insistence
on formatting your text as paragraphs for you,
and on worrying about fonts and styles and the like,
will only get in your way.)
To perform step 2, you'll invoke your compiler.
And to perform step 3, you'll invoke <em>your program</em>;
if the compilation in step 2 is successful,
the compiler will build your program as an executable file
(typically in the current directory),
which you can then invoke and run just like any other command.
