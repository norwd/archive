<B>Compiling C Programs: Step by Step
</B><br>
<br>
Steve Summit
<br>
<br>
<p>This handout contains reasonably detailed,
step-by-step instructions
for entering, compiling, and running C programs,
in a number of environments.
Much of this information appears in other handouts as well,
so there is a certain amount of overlap here.
If you've got a good handle on the compilation process,
there's no need to read this handout,
but if you've been having difficulty,
or prefer explicit instructions, read on.
</p><p>Since everyone's situation is different
(different environments,
different compilers,
different amounts of experience,
different learning styles),
this handout will run through the process several
times,
with increasing levels of detail.
After the first two overviews,
the discussion splits into threads
for several environments:
Unix, DOS/Windows, and the Macintosh.
