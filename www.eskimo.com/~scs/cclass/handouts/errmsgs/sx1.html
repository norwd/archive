<H1>Error and Warning Messages</H1>

<UL><li>``syntax error''
<br>
<br>
This is the granddaddy of all compiler error messages,
although it can be less than useful.
It means that there's something wrong
with the <dfn>syntax</dfn> of your program
(yes, I know, you figured that much out already).
Roughly speaking,
``syntax'' refers to
the typographical characters
you've used to express your program
and the order you've arranged them in.
If parts of your program are in the wrong order,
or if some required punctuation
(such as a comma, semicolon, brace, or parenthesis)
is missing, you're liable to get this error.
The actual error is not always on the line the compiler indicates;
sometimes, a problem on one line isn't noticed right away but
percolates down and triggers an error message a few lines later.
<br>
<br>
You may also get this error
if you're trying to use an old, pre-ANSI compiler
(such as <TT>cc</TT> on many Unix systems)
to compile a newer, ANSI-compatible program.
(Try using <TT>acc</TT> or <TT>gcc</TT> instead.)
<li>``undefined symbol <I>x</I>''
<li>``undeclared variable <I>x</I>''
<li>``<I>x</I> undefined''
<br>
<br>
All of these mean that you have apparently tried to use
a variable named <I>x</I>
(or, of course, whatever name the compiler is complaining about)
without declaring it.
C requires that all variables be <dfn>declared</dfn> before use;
the declaration informs the compiler in advance
of the name and type of each variable that you will be using.
(If the compiler is complaining about a variable
which you <em>did</em> think you'd declared,
it may be that you misspelled it
either where you declared it or where you used it,
or that you declared it in a different part of your program
than the part where you're trying to use it.)
<br>
<br>
(See also discussion about ``undefined external'' message below.)
<li>``newline in string or character constant''
<br>
<br>
This simply means that you've got an unbalanced
single quote <TT>'</TT>
or double quote <TT>"</TT>.
Here is an example:
<pre>
	printf("hello, world!\n);
</pre>
You might wonder why it's illegal to have a newline in a string constant
(and why it is that you have to use the <TT>\n</TT> sequence instead).
The reason is precisely
so that the compiler can give you this error message
when you accidentally leave out a closing quote.
Otherwise, the compiler might try to interpret
the whole rest of your source file as one very long string constant.
<li>``bad lvalue'' (or ``missing lvalue'')
<br>
<br>
<dfn>lvalue</dfn> is a piece of compiler writer's jargon
which refers to an object with a <B>l</B>ocation.
(Actually, its original derivation had to do with the fact that
lvalues are what appear on the
<B>l</B>eft hand side of an assignment operator.)
What this message means to you and me is
that the compiler was trying to assign to or modify some variable,
but there was no variable there for it to modify
(or, perhaps, for some reason the particular variable
could not be modified).
For example, if you accidentally wrote
<pre>
	1 = a + b
</pre>
(that's a number <TT>1</TT> there, not a letter <TT>l</TT>),
the compiler would complain,
because the number 1 is not a variable
which it's possible for you to assign a new value to.
<li>``can't find header file <I>xxx</I><TT>.h</TT>''
<br>
<br>
This message means that one of your source files
contains a line like
<pre>
	#include &lt;<I>xxx</I>.h&gt;
</pre>
or
<pre>
	#include "<I>xxx</I>.h"
</pre>
but the compiler
(specifically, the preprocessor)
could not find the header file <I>xxx</I><TT>.h</TT>.
<br>
<br>
If the header file is one of your own
(usually one that you've used the <TT>#include ""</TT> form with),
make sure that you have actually
composed (written) the header file,
and that it is in the correct directory--usually,
the same directory as the rest of your source files.
<br>
<br>
If the header file is a Standard one
(usually one that you've used the <TT>#include &lt;&gt;</TT> form with),
such as <TT>stdio.h</TT>,
then there's something wrong with the way the compiler has been
installed or configured.
You may have to go into a configuration screen and set the
directory name where the standard header files are kept.
(Of course, to do this,
<em>you</em> will have to know where that directory is!
It usually has a name like ``<TT>include</TT>'',
and is located somewhere within the compiler's installation tree.)
<br>
<br>
(Finally,
if the preprocessor is complaining about a misspelled header name,
simply fix the misspelling.)
<li>``undefined external: <I>xxx</I>''
<br>
<br>
This message means that during the linking stage,
a function
(or, occasionally, a global variable)
by the name of <I>xxx</I> could not be found.
There can be several causes,
depending on whether the function is one of your own,
or was one which you had expected would be provided for you.
<br>
<br>
If the function name is one of your own,
you'll have to figure out why the linker couldn't find it.
Did you provide a defining instance
(not just an external declaration)
for the function?
Did you enter its source code
into the same file(s) as the rest of the program?
If not, did you tell the linker where to find it?
You'll either have to write the function if you forgot to,
or adjust the program's build procedure
(perhaps by editing the ``Makefile''
or adding a ``module'' to the ``project list'').
<br>
<br>
If the function name is one from the Standard C library,
such as <TT>printf</TT>, which was supposed to be provided for you,
you'll have to figure out why the linker couldn't find it.
Occasionally, the problem is that
the compiler doesn't know where the Standard library is.
You may have to go into a configuration screen
and set the path or directory name of the library.
(Of course, to do this,
<em>you</em> will have to know where the library is!
It usually has a name containing the string ``libc'',
such as <TT>libc.a</TT> or <TT>SLIBC.LIB</TT>.
The libraries--there may be several--are
often located in a subdirectory named ``<TT>lib</TT>'',
somewhere within the compiler's installation tree.)
<br>
<br>
If the undefined function's name is
close but not exactly the same as
one of your own functions
or one of the Standard library functions,
it obviously means that you've mistyped its name
in a function call somewhere.
All you have to do is find that typo
in whichever source file it's in,
fix it, and recompile.
<br>
<br>
If the function is a math-related one,
such as <TT>sin</TT>, <TT>cos</TT>, or <TT>sqrt</TT>,
and you're using a Unix system,
make sure that you've used the <TT>-lm</TT> option,
at the <em>end</em> of the command line,
when compiling/linking.
<br>
<br>
If the function name printed in the error message
includes a leading underscore,
don't worry about the underscore.
(Under some compilers,
the names manipulated by the linker
have this underscore added by the compiler,
although you continue to refer to the function
by the name you thought you had given it.)
In most cases,
if the linker complains about ``<TT>_myfunc</TT>'' being undefined,
it's ``<TT>myfunc</TT>'' you've got to worry about.
<br>
<br>
If the name is ``<TT>_end</TT>'',
you'll rarely have to worry about it;
this is a symbol used internally by the traditional Unix linkers,
and shows up as ``undefined''
only when there are also other symbols undefined.
If you fix all of the others,
the mysterious undefined ``<TT>_end</TT>'' will also disappear.
<br>
<br>
(See also discussion about ``undeclared variable'' message above.)
<li>``call of function with no prototype in scope''
<br>
<br>
This message means that the compiler has noticed you trying to call
a function which the compiler has no
(or only minimal) information about.
Under most compilers,
this is a warning message,
not an error,
because the compiler is willing to assume
certain things about unknown functions,
and will let you try to call them.
However, the assumptions it makes might not be right,
and the compiler won't be able to check
that you've called the function
with the correct number and type of arguments,
which is why it issues the warning.
<br>
<br>
If you'd like the compiler to keep checking function calls
carefully for you,
you must arrange to supply prototypes for the functions you call.
For functions from the Standard C library,
you almost always supply prototypes
by using the <TT>#include</TT> directive.
For example, in a source file where you call <TT>printf</TT>,
you should always have the line
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>
near the top of the file,
because <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> contains the prototype for <TT>printf</TT>
(and many other functions).
For your own functions,
you will have to supply your own prototypes.
(You may wish to place them in your own header files,
and use <TT>#include ""</TT> to bring them in
wherever they're needed.
Using header files in this way
is generally more reliable
than manually typing copies of the prototype
into each source file where a particular function of yours is called.)
<br>
<br>
If, for whatever reason,
you'd rather that the compiler not check function calls for you
(that is, if you think that you can get them right yourself),
you can usually configure a compiler not to complain
about function calls with no prototype in scope.
