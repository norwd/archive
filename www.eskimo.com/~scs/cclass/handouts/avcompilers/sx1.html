<H1>Commercial Compilers</H1>

<p>The most ``popular''
(whatever that means)
compilers for MS-DOS and Windows systems are manufactured
by Microsoft and Inprise (formerly Borland).
Both of these companies have several compiler products to offer,
including some cheap ones (under $100) targeted at individuals,
and some expensive ones ($600 to $1000 or more)
targeted at professional software developers.
There are compilers for MS-DOS or Windows
(though the former are becoming obsolete)
and for C, C++, or both.
An inexpensive
($20 or $30)
commercial option is

Power C from Mix Software,


1132 Commerce Drive,
Richardson, TX 75801,
214-783-6001.

</p><p>For the Macintosh,
the two commercial compilers I know of are
Think C by Symantec,
and CodeWarrior by Metroworks.
