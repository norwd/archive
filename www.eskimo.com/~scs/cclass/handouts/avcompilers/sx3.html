<H1>Shareware and Freeware Compilers</H1>

<p>
I've heard of
a couple of
shareware C compilers for MS-DOS,
but I don't know much about them.
One
is or was available in the file <TT>PCC12C.ZIP</TT>
and might have been written by somebody named Mark De Smet.
Another, ``Pacific C'',
is or was available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.hitech.com.au/hitech/pacific">ftp.hitech.com.au/hitech/pacific</a>.
</p><p>A research group at Princeton generated a
``Retargetable C Compiler''
and made the results freely available.
Supposedly they have a compiler called <TT>lcc</TT>,
although I've never tried it.
You can find details on their web page,
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc</a> .
</p><p>Finally, we come to the GNU C compiler,
or <TT>gcc</TT>.
This is an extremely high-quality compiler
put out by the folks at the Free Software Foundation.
It was originally developed as a Unix compiler,
and there are plenty of professional programmers
doing serious, commercial development
using it.
There are also ports to other operating systems,
including VMS and--though it seems impossible--MS-DOS.
<TT>gcc</TT> is a huge and powerful compiler and MS-DOS is a
cramped,
restricted
quasi operating system,
but somehow D J Delorie got <TT>gcc</TT> working under it,
by dint of a lot of hard work and a 32-bit DOS extender or two.
The result is called ``djgpp,''
and it's described on its own web page at
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/</a>.
(The main, non-djgpp distribution of <TT>gcc</TT>
is on the FSF's ftp server at
<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu">prep.ai.mit.edu</a>;
see also the FSF home page at <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">http://www.fsf.org/</a>.)
</p><p>The downside of <TT>gcc</TT>
(and, by extension, djgpp)
is that it is huge, complex, and difficult to install.
It is explicitly ``not recommended for use in learning C.''
I have had students use it successfully,
but downloading and installing it
(it's between 5 and 10 meg to download)
is a daunting task.
</p><p>I've heard that there's another,
more recent
port of <TT>gcc</TT>
that's tailored for use with Windows,
but I don't know any details
yet.
</p><p>Alas, there are currently no
shareware or freeware compilers that I know of for the Macintosh.
(There were two, Sesame C and Harvest C,
but the former never worked and
the latter only barely worked and has been abandoned by its author.
I've heard that there is a version of <TT>gcc</TT>
which works on the Macintosh,
but it requires the Macintosh Programmer's Workbench which,
though it's available free from Apple,
is nearly impossible to use.)
