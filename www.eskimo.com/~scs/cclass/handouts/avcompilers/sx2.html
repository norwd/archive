<H1>Inexpensive Compilers</H1>

<p>If you don't need the latest-and-greatest compiler
(and, as we'll see, you don't),
there are a number of ``budget'' alternatives.
One is to find a used compiler--several
computer stores and bookstores
(including Half-Price Books in the Seattle area)
carry used software at a fraction of its original price.
The software is always a few years old,
but it's fully functional
and comes with complete documentation at a price that's hard to beat.
(Whenever I visit Half-Price Books,
I
just about always
see copies of
Microsoft, Borland/Inprise, and Think C for $30-50,
which when new would have cost $100-600.)
</p><p>Another option
(also to be found in bookstores)
is to obtain a book with a title like
``Teach Yourself C in N days--<em>disk included!</em>''.
I've seen two or three titles along these lines,
for between 30 and 50 dollars.
The disk contains
(among other things)
a stripped-down version of some popular, commercial compiler.
Since the book sells for less than the full-fledged compiler would by itself,
the version of the compiler included with the book
is typically crippled in some way,
designed to be useful for students learning C
but not for professionals doing large-scale software development.
But since we're learning C,
a ``learning'' compiler is fine,
and even if the book is no good,
the cover price may be worth it for the compiler alone.
