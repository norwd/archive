<H1>C Programming Notes</H1>
<B>A Short Introduction to Programming
</B><br>
<br>
Steve Summit
<br>
<br>
<p>At its most basic level,
programming a computer simply means telling it what to do,
and this
vapid-sounding
definition is not
even
a joke.
There are no other truly fundamental aspects of computer 
programming;
everything else we talk about will simply be the details of a 
particular,
usually artificial,
mechanism for telling a computer what to do.
Sometimes these mechanisms are chosen because they have been 
found to be convenient for programmers (people) to use;
other times they have been chosen because they're easy for the 
computer to understand.
The first hard thing about programming is to learn, become 
comfortable with, and accept these artificial mechanisms, 
whether they make ``sense'' to you or not.
</p><p>In fact, you shouldn't worry if some
(or even many) of the mechanisms used for programming a 
computer don't make sense.
It doesn't make sense that the cold water faucet has to be on 
the right side and the hot one has to be on the left;
that's just the convention we've settled on.
Similarly, many computer programming mechanisms are quite 
arbitrary, and were chosen not because of any theoretical 
motivation but simply because we needed an unambiguous way to 
say something to a computer.
</p><p>In this introduction to programming,
we'll talk about several things:
skills needed in programming,
a simplified programming model,
elements of real programming languages,
computer representation of numbers,
characters and strings,
and compiler terminology.
