<H1>Real Programming Model</H1>

<p>A computer program consists of two parts:
<dfn>code</dfn> and <dfn>data</dfn>.
The code is the set of instructions for performing a task,
and the data is the set of ``registers'' or 
``memory locations'' which contain the intermediate 
results which are used as the program performs its
calculations.
</p><p>Note that the code is relatively <dfn>static</dfn>
while the data is <dfn>dynamic</dfn>.
Once you've gotten a program working,
its code won't change,
but every time you run it,
it will
typically
be working with different data,
so the memory locations will take on different values.
</p><p>Once you've written a program,
you've defined a new thing that your computer can do.
The applications
(text and graphic editors, spreadsheets, games, etc.)
which your computer may already have
are ``just'' programs,
written by programmers
using programming languages
such as the one you're about to learn.
