Assignment #5 ANSWERS
</B><br>
<br>
<p>Question 1.
<I>What's wrong with
<TT>#define N 10;
</TT>?
</I><p>The semicolon at the end of the line
will become part of <TT>N</TT>'s definition,
which is hardly ever what you want.
<p>Question 2.
<I>Suppose you had the definition
<TT>#define SIX 2*3
</TT>.
What value would the declaration
<TT>int x = 12 / SIX;
</TT>initialize <TT>x</TT> to?
</I><p>18.
(18?
How could it be 18?
It sure looks like it should be 2, doesn't it?)
<p>The preprocessor performs a simple textual substitution;
it knows nothing about operator precedence,
or even much about the syntax of C.
After the preprocessor substitutes the value of the macro 
<TT>SIX</TT>,
the declaration looks like
<pre>
	int x = 12 / 2*3;
</pre>
Since multiplication and division ``group''
(or ``associate'')
from left to right,
this is interpreted as
<pre>
	int x = (12 / 2) * 3;
</pre>
To guard against these ``surprises,''
it's a very good idea to parenthesize the values of macros which 
are not simple constants.
In this case, a safer definition of the macro would have been
<pre>
	#define SIX (2*3)
</pre>
This way, when the preprocessor performs its simple textual substitution,
the resulting expression is automatically parenthesized
so that the compiler gives you the result you expect.
(Of course,
this hypothetical <TT>SIX</TT> macro is useless in any case,
but the point is that whenever a macro's value is an expression
of any kind,
it needs extra parentheses
to avoid surprises.)
<p>Question 3.
<I>If the header file <TT>x.h</TT> contains
an external prototype declaration for a function <TT>q()</TT>,
where should <TT>x.h</TT> be included?
</I><p>It should be included in each source file where <TT>q()</TT>
is called, so that the compiler will see the prototype declaration
and be able to generate correct code.
It should <em>also</em> be included
in the source file where <TT>q()</TT> is <em>defined</em>,
so that the compiler will be able to notice, and complain about, 
any mismatches between the prototype declaration and the actual definition.
(It's vital that the prototype
which will be
used where a function is called be accurate;
an incorrect prototype is worse than useless.)
<p>Question 4.
<I>How many differences can you think of between <TT>i</TT> and <TT>J</TT></I>?
<p>The line
<pre>
	int i = 10;
</pre>
declares a conventional run-time variable, named <TT>i</TT>,
initially containing the value 10.
It will be possible to change <TT>i</TT>'s value at run time.
<TT>i</TT> may appear in expressions
(i.e., its value may be fetched),
but since it is not constant,
it could not be used where C requires a constant,
such as in the dimension of an array declaration.
<p>The line
<pre>
	#define J 10
</pre>
on the other hand,
defines a preprocessor macro named <TT>J</TT> having the value <TT>10</TT>.
For the rest of the current source file, anywhere you write a single <TT>J</TT>,
the preprocessor will replace it with <TT>10</TT>.
An array declaration such as
<pre>
	int a[J];
</pre>
will be fine;
it will be just as if you had written
<pre>
	int a[10];
</pre>
However, <TT>J</TT> exists only at compile time.
It is not a run-time variable; if you tried to
``change its value'' at run time by writing
<pre>
	J = 20;
</pre>
it would be just as if you had written
<pre>
	10 = 20;
</pre>
and the compiler would complain.
<p>(One more little difference is that the line
<TT>int i = 10;
</TT>ends in a semicolon,
while the line
<TT>#define J 10
</TT>does not.)
<p>Exercise 2.
<I>Write a program to read its input and write it out, double-spaced.
</I><p>This is easy if we realize that
all we have to do is
read the input a character at a time,
copying each input character through to the output,
except that whenever we see a <TT>'\n'</TT> character,
write a second one out, too.
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int c;

	while((c = getchar()) != EOF)
		{
		putchar(c);
		if(c == '\n')
			putchar('\n');
		}

	return 0;
}
</pre>
The program won't be too interesting if you type text at it interactively.
If you're using a Unix or MS-DOS system,
you can run it on a file by typing
<pre>
	doublespace &lt; filename
</pre>
The <TT>&lt;</TT> mechanism indicates that
the program should be run
with its ``standard input''
(i.e. the stream of characters read by <TT>getchar</TT>)
connected to the file with the given <TT>filename</TT>,
rather than to the keyboard.
<p>Exercise 3.
<I>Write a function
which counts the number of times a character appears in a string.
</I><p>Here is the function.
Notice that it is very similar to the <TT>mystrlen</TT> function in the notes,
except that rather than counting all characters in the string,
it only counts those matching the argument <TT>c</TT>.
<pre>
int countnchars(char string[], int ch)
{
	int i;
	int count = 0;
	for(i = 0; string[i] != '\0'; i++)
		{
		if(string[i] == ch)
			count++;
		}
	return count;
}
</pre>
Here is a tiny little main program, to test it out:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

extern int countnchars(char string[], int ch);

int main()
{
	char string[] = "Hello, world!";
	char c = 'o';

	printf("The letter %c appears in \"%s\" %d times.\n",
		c, string, countnchars(string, c));
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Exercise 4.
<I>Write a short program to read two lines of text,
and concatenate them using <TT>strcat</TT>.
</I><br>
<br>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;	/* for strcpy and strcat */

#define MAXLINE 100

extern int getline(char [], int);

int main()
{
	char string1[MAXLINE], string2[MAXLINE];
	int len1, len2;
	char newstring[MAXLINE*2];

	printf("enter first string:\n");
	len1 = getline(string1, MAXLINE);
	printf("enter second string:\n");
	len2 = getline(string2, MAXLINE);

	if(len1 == EOF || len2 == EOF)
		exit(1);

	strcpy(newstring, string1);
	strcat(newstring, string2);

	printf("%s\n", newstring);

	return 0;
}</pre>
<p>Exercise 5.
<I>Write a function
to find a substring in a larger string
and replace it with a different substring.
</I><p>Here is one way.
(Since the function doesn't return anything,
I've defined it with a return type of <TT>void</TT>.)
<pre>
void replace(char string[], char from[], char to[])
{
	int start, i1, i2;
	for(start = 0; string[start] != '\0'; start++)
		{
		i1 = 0;
		i2 = start;
		while(from[i1] != '\0')
			{
			if(from[i1] != string[i2])
				break;
			i1++;
			i2++;
			}
		if(from[i1] == '\0')
			{
			for(i1 = 0; to[i1] != '\0'; i1++)
				string[start++] = to[i1];
			return;
			}
		}
}
</pre>
This code is very similar to
the <TT>mystrstr</TT> 
function
in the notes, chapter 10, section 10.4, p. 8.
(Since <TT>strstr</TT>'s job is to find one string within 
another, it's a natural for the first half of <TT>replace</TT>.)
<p><I>Extra credit:
Think about what <TT>replace()</TT> should do
if the <TT>from</TT> string appears multiple times
in the input string.
</I><p>Our first
implementation
replaced only the first occurrence
(if any)
of the <TT>from</TT> string.
It happens, though, that it's trivial to rewrite our first version
to make it replace all occurrences--just omit the 
<TT>return</TT> after the first string has been replaced:
<pre>
void replace(char string[], char from[], char to[])
{
	int start, i1, i2;
	for(start = 0; string[start] != '\0'; start++)
		{
		i1 = 0;
		i2 = start;
		while(from[i1] != '\0')
			{
			if(from[i1] != string[i2])
				break;
			i1++;
			i2++;
			}
		if(from[i1] == '\0')
			{
			for(i1 = 0; to[i1] != '\0'; i1++)
				string[start++] = to[i1];
			}
		}
}
</pre>
