<p><B>Review Questions:
</B></p><OL><li>Approximately what is the line <TT>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>
at the top of a C source file for?
<li>What are some uses for comments?
<li>Why is indentation important?
How carefully does the compiler pay attention to it?
<li>What are the largest and smallest values that can be reliably
stored in a variable of type <TT>int</TT>?
<li>What is the difference between the constants
<TT>7</TT>, <TT>'7'</TT>, and <TT>"7"</TT>?
<li>What is the difference between the constants
<TT>123</TT> and <TT>"123"</TT>?
<li>What is the function of the semicolon in a C statement?
</OL><p><B>Exercises:
</B>(easy to harder; do as many as you like, but at least two)
<p>1.
Get the ``Hello, world!'' program to work on your computer.
If you're using a Unix machine, the instructions in the notes should
get you started.
If you're using a commercial compiler on a home
computer, the compiler's instruction manuals should (really, <em>must</em>)
tell you how to enter, compile, and run a program.
(In either case, the
``<a href="../handouts/cstepbystep/top.html">Compiling C Programs</a>''
handout should help, too.)
<p>2.
What do these loops print?
<pre>
for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i = i + 2)
	printf("%d\n", i);
</pre>
<pre>
for(i = 100; i &gt;= 0; i = i - 7)
	printf("%d\n", i);
</pre>
<pre>
for(i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1)
	printf("%d\n", i);
</pre>
<pre>
for(i = 2; i &lt; 100; i = i * 2)
	printf("%d\n", i);
</pre>
<p>3.
Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 10
and their squares:
<pre>
	1	1
	2	4
	3	9
	...
	10	100
</pre>
<p>4.
Write a program to print this triangle:
<pre>
	*
	**
	***
	****
	*****
	******
	*******
	********
	*********
	**********
</pre>
Don't use ten <TT>printf</TT> statements; use two nested loops instead.
You'll have to use braces around the body of the outer loop if
it contains multiple statements:
<pre>
	for(i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1)
		{
		/* multiple statements */
		/* can go in here */
		}
</pre>
(Hint: a string you hand to <TT>printf</TT> does not have to contain the
newline character <TT>\n</TT>.)
