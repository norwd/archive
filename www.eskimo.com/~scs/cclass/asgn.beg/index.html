<H1>Introductory C Programming -- Assignments</H1>

<p>
Here are
<!-- or will be -->
the problem sets I hand out during each of the eight weeks
this class runs when I teach it in person.
If you're out there on the net somewhere,
unable to attend the class in person,
feel free to follow along here!
<!-- As I write this (April, 1997), -->
<!-- I am just starting to place the assignments here, -->
<!-- as I hand them out during my spring quarter class. -->
<!-- I'll be placing the answer sheets up one week at a time, too, -->
<!-- partly because I don't have them all converted to HTML yet, -->
<!-- and partly because I don't want to tempt my students -->
<!-- into peeking at the answers -->
<!-- until they've given the problems their best shot. -->
