<br>
<p><B>Tutorial Section
</B><OL><li>Here is another nested-loop example,
similar to exercise 4 of assignment 1,

and to tutorial 3 of assignment 2.
This one prints an addition table for sums from 1+1 to 10+10.
<pre>
/* print an addition table for 1+1 up to 10+10 */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int i, j;
	/* print header line: */
	printf("  ");
	for(j = 1; j &lt;= 10; j = j + 1)
		printf(" %3d", j);
	printf("\n");
	/* print table: */
	for(i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1)
		{
		printf("%2d", i);
		for(j = 1; j &lt;= 10; j = j + 1)
			printf(" %3d", i + j);
		printf("\n");
		}
	return 0;
}
</pre>
The first <TT>j</TT> loop prints the top, header row of the table.
(The initial <TT>printf("  ");</TT>
is to make it line up with the rows beneath,
which will all begin with a value of <TT>i</TT>.)
Then, the <TT>i</TT> loop prints the rest of the table,
one row per value of <TT>i</TT>.
For each value of <TT>i</TT>, we print that value
(on the left edge of the table),
and then print the sums
resulting from adding that value of <TT>i</TT>
to ten different values of <TT>j</TT>
(using a second, inner loop on <TT>j</TT>).
<br>
<br>
Make a simple modification to the program to print a multiplication table,
or a subtraction table.
<li>Here is yet another nested-loop example.
It is very similar to the one above,
except that rather than printing the sum <TT>i+j</TT>,
it determines whether the sum is even or odd,
using the expression
<TT>(i+j) % 2
</TT>.
The <TT>%</TT> operator, remember, gives the remainder when dividing,
and
an
even number gives a remainder of 0 when dividing by 2.
Depending on whether the sum is even or odd,
the program prints an asterisk or a space.
Type in and run the program, and look at the pattern that results.
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int i, j;
	for(i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1)
		{
		for(j = 1; j &lt;= 10; j = j + 1)
			{
			if((i + j) % 2 == 0)
				printf("* ");
			else	printf("  ");
			}
		printf("\n");
		}
	return 0;
}
</pre>
(Why are there parentheses around
<TT>i + j</TT>
in the expression
<TT>(i + j) % 2
</TT>?
What if they were left out?)
<br>
<br>
Modify the program to print a pattern of <TT>.</TT> and <TT>#</TT> characters,
or X's and O's.
If you wish, experiment by taking the remainder
when dividing by 3 or 4, instead.
Since the remainder when dividing by 3 can be 0, 1, or 2,
you could use a cascaded <TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> statement
to print one of three characters for each sum
(or one of four if taking the remainder when dividing by 4).
<li>Later in this assignment
(exercise 3),
you're asked to create a simple function to compute the squares of numbers.
Sometimes,
rather than writing a function
which will compute a value each time it's called,
it's useful to build an array
containing all the values we might need.
Here is a program which declares an array,
then fills it with the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int i;
	int squares[11];	/* [0..10]; [0] ignored */
	/* fill array: */
	for(i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1)
		squares[i] = i * i;
	/* print table: */
	printf("n\tsquare\n");
	for(i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1)
		printf("%d\t%d\n", i, squares[i]);
	return 0;
}
</pre>
There's one slight trick in the declaration of the <TT>squares</TT> array.
Remember that arrays in C are based at 0.
So if we wanted an array to hold the squares of 10 numbers,
and if we declared it as
<TT>int squares[10];
</TT>the array's 10 elements would range from
<TT>squares[0]</TT> to <TT>squares[9]</TT>.
This program wants to use elements
from <TT>squares[1]</TT> to <TT>squares[10]</TT>,
so it simply declares the array as having size 11,
and wastes the 0th element.
<br>
<br>
The program also uses the tab character, <TT>\t</TT>,
in its printouts,
to make the columns line up.
<br>
<br>
Modify the program so that it also declares and fills in
a <TT>cubes</TT> array containing the cubes
(third powers)
of the numbers 1-10,
and prints them out in a third column.
<li>We're going to write a simple
(<em>very</em> simple!)
graphics program.
We'll write a function <TT>printsquare</TT>
which prints a square
(made out of asterisks)
of a certain size.
Then we'll use our favorite for-<TT>i</TT>-equals-1-to-10 loop
to call the function 10 times,
printing squares of size 1 to 10.
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int printsquare(int);

int main()
{
	int i;
	for(i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1)
		{
		printsquare(i);
		printf("\n");
		}
	return 0;
}

int printsquare(int n)
{
	int i, j;
	for(i = 0; i &lt; n; i = i + 1)
		{
		for(j = 0; j &lt; n; j = j + 1)
			printf("*");
		printf("\n");
		}
	return 0;
}
</pre>
Type the program in and run it.
Then
see
if you can modify
it
to print ``open'' squares,
like this:
<pre>
****
*  *
*  *
****
</pre>
instead of filled squares.
You'll have to print the box in three parts:
first the top row,
then a number of ``<TT>*  *</TT>'' rows,
and finally the bottom row.
There's obviously no way to print ``open'' boxes of size 1 or 2,
so don't worry about those cases.
(That is,
you can
change the loop in the top-level <TT>main</TT> function to
<TT>for(i = 3; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1)
</TT>.)
</OL><br>
<br>
</p><p><B>Exercises
</B>(pick three or four):
</p><OL><li>Write code to sum the elements of an array of <TT>int</TT>.
(Write it as a function, if you like.)
Use it to sum the array
<pre>
	int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
</pre>
(The answer, of course, should be 21).
<li>Write a loop to call the <TT>multbytwo()</TT> function (chapter
5, section 5.1, p. 1) on the numbers 1-10.
For extra credit,
compile your <TT>main</TT> function and
the <TT>multbytwo()</TT> function
as two source files, one function per file.
<li>Write a <TT>square()</TT> function and use it to print the squares
of the numbers 1-10:
<pre>
1  1
2  4
3  9
4  16
...
9  81
10 100
</pre>
<li>Write the function
<pre>
	void printnchars(int ch, int n)
</pre>
which is supposed to print the character <TT>ch</TT>, <TT>n</TT> times.
(Remember
that <TT>%c</TT> is the <TT>printf</TT> format to use for printing characters.)
For example, the call <TT>printnchars('x', 5)</TT> would print 5 <TT>x</TT>'s.  Use
this function to rewrite the triangle-printing program of assignment
1 (exercise 4).
<li>Write a function to compute the factorial of a number, and use
it to print the factorials of the numbers 1-7.
(Extra credit:
print the factorials of the numbers 1-10.)
<li>(Kernighan and Ritchie)
Write a function <TT>celsius()</TT> to convert
degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.
(The conversion formula
is &#176;C = 5/9 <TT>*</TT> (&#176;F - 32).)
Use it to print a Fahrenheit-to-Centigrade table
for -40 to 220 degrees Fahrenheit, in increments of 10 degrees.
(Remember that <TT>%f</TT> is the <TT>printf</TT> format to use for printing floating-point
numbers.
Also, remember
that the integer expression <TT>5/9</TT> gives 0,
so you <em>won't</em> want to use integer division.)
<li>Modify the dice-rolling program
(Sec. 4.1)
so that it computes the average
of all the rolls of the pair of dice.
Remember that integer division
truncates, so you'll have to declare some of your variables as
<TT>float</TT> or <TT>double</TT>.
<br>
<br>
For extra credit, also compute the standard deviation, which can
be expressed as
<blockquote>sqrt((sum(x*x) - sum(x)*sum(x)/n) / (n - 1))
</blockquote>(where the notation sum(x) indicates summing all values of x,
as usually expressed with the Greek letter sigma;
there is <em>not</em> such a sum() function in C!)
If you put the line
<pre>
	#include &lt;math.h&gt;
</pre>
at the top of the file, you'll be able to call <TT>sqrt()</TT>.
<br>
<br>
(See the note in Assignment #2, Exercise 5, about compiling with
the math library under Unix.
There are better ways of computing
the standard deviation, but the above expression will suffice
for our purposes.)
<li>Write either the function
<pre>
	randrange(int n)
</pre>
which returns random integers from 1 to <TT>n</TT>, or the function
<pre>
	int randrange2(int m, int n)
</pre>
which returns random integers in the range <TT>m</TT> to <TT>n</TT>.  Use your function
to streamline the dice-rolling program a bit.
<br>
<br>
The header file <TT>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT> defines a constant, <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>, which
is the maximum number returned by the <TT>rand()</TT> function.
A better
way of reducing the range of the <TT>rand()</TT> function is like this:
<pre>
	rand() / (RAND_MAX / N + 1)
</pre>
(where <TT>N</TT> is the range of numbers you want).
<br>
<br>
Extra credit: investigate the behavior of <TT>randrange(2)</TT>, both using
the ``obvious'' range-reduction technique (the modulus operator <TT>%</TT>,
as shown in the notes) and this improved method.  If your library's
implementation of <TT>rand()</TT> is a good one, you won't see a difference.
But if you're not so lucky, you may see something very surprising.
<li>Rewrite the dice-rolling program to also print a histogram.
For example, if there are 21 rolls of 7, the output line ``<TT>7: 21</TT>''
should also contain a horizontal row of 21 asterisks.
(Use the <TT>printnchars</TT> function from exercise 4, if you wish.)
The output might look like this:
<pre>
2: 2    **
3: 5    *****
4: 4    ****
5: 10   **********
6: 15   ***************
7: 28   ****************************
8: 12   ************
9: 9    *********
10: 7   *******
11: 5   *****
12: 3   ***
