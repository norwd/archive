<H1>Integers vs. real numbers</H1>

<p>An <dfn>integer</dfn> is a number without a fractional part,
a number you could use to count things
(although integers may also be negative).
Mathematicians may distinguish between natural numbers and 
cardinal numbers,
and linguists may distinguish between cardinal numbers and 
ordinal numbers,
but these distinctions do not concern us here.
</p><p>A <dfn>real number</dfn> is,
for our purposes,
simply a number with a fractional part.
Since computers do not typically implement real numbers exactly,
it is not
necessary or
even meaningful to distinguish between
rational, irrational, and transcendental numbers.
