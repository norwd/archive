<H1>C Programming Notes</H1>
<B>A Brief Refresher on Some Math Often Used in Computing
</B><br>
<br>
Steve Summit
<br>
<br>
<p>There are a few
mathematical concepts
which
figure prominently in programming.
None of these involve higher math
(or even algebra,
and as we'll see,
knowing algebra too well
can make one particular programming idiom rather confusing).
You don't have to understand these with deep mathematical 
sophistication,
but keeping them in mind will help some things make more sense.
