<B>An Introduction to ``The Game''
</B><br>
<br>
<p>Our ongoing example
during this entire class
will be a relatively simple but fully functional
text-based adventure game,
patterned roughly after the classic games ADVENT and Zork.
If you haven't played one of these games before,
the basic idea is that you are an ``actor''
in a playing field
(often referred to as a ``dungeon'')
consisting of a number of interconnected rooms.
You can move from room to room,
pick up objects you find lying around
(such as keys or swords or C compilers),
and use these objects to perform various tasks,
such as unlocking doors
or slaying dragons
or writing programs.
</p><p>You interact with the game
by typing commands
which are simple English sentences.
(In our first attempts,
the sentences will be very simple indeed,
but in sophisticated games of this sort
the parsers are quite elaborate
and can ``understand'' rather complicated sentences.)
The game responds to each command
by telling you what you see--a
new room you've entered,
or the result of some task you've managed to perform.
</p><p>Part of the ``fun''
(or, at least, the challenge)
of these games
is just figuring out what commands are acceptable.
To get you started,
you move from room to room
with the commands ``north'', ``east'',
``west'', and ``south''
(which can be abbreviated to ``n'', ``e'',
``w'', or ``s'').
You can pick up objects with the ``take'' command
and put them down by saying ``drop''.
You can request a description of the room you're in
by typing ``look'',
and request a list of your possessions
by typing ``inventory''
(or just ``i'').
</p><p>(Of course, since you have the source code of this particular game,
there's an easy way out of the challenge of discovering
which commands it accepts,
once you discover the C function which is in charge of
matching the commands you type
against the list of verbs which the game understands.)
</p><p>It might seem as if such a game would be
difficult to write,
but as we'll see,
it can actually be quite easy.
Study the code,
starting with <TT>main.c</TT>,
followed by <TT>commands.c</TT>,
followed by <TT>object.c</TT> and <TT>room.c</TT>.
(All along you'll want to refer to <TT>game.h</TT>.)
At first it will seem that the high-level functions
are all shirking their responsibilities--it
will seem as if they're doing no real work,
but rather doing only the easy part
and then calling some other function to do the rest.
At first, it will seem as if these sub-functions
are going to get stuck with all the hard work,
but when we get to them,
we'll find that they're nicely simple, too.
In fact,
the complexity which we might have imagined the program would contain
may seem to melt away before our eyes,
as we discover that the program is composed of many functions
each of which is quite easy to understand.
If this

result

surprises you,
study it well,
because attacking a problem in this way--making
a hard problem tractable by breaking it up into pieces
each of which seems simple
but which in concert perform a task
which seems harder than the sum of the parts--this
process is the essence of good programming.
<br>
<br>
</p><p>The game revolves around three data structures,
one describing the player (or ``actor''),
one describing a room,
and one describing an object.
Since the dungeon will typically consist of many rooms,
and since there will typically be many objects
scattered among the rooms,
we'll typically have many instances of the room and object structures.
The object structure will contain a ``next'' field,
capable of pointing at another object,
so that several objects can be strung together
as a singly-linked list.
We'll use these lists of objects to represent
the set of objects sitting in a room,
or in an actor's possession.
</p><p>Rooms will be linked together, too,
but in a more complex way:
each room will have up to four pointers
to other rooms.
These pointers can be thought of as doorways or corridors:
the pointed-to room is the room that will be gone to
if an actor travels in one of the four compass directions
out of the original room.
(A room's exits will be stored in an array of four pointers,
where element <TT>[0]</TT> is the north exit,
<TT>[1]</TT> is south,
<TT>[2]</TT> is east,
and <TT>[3]</TT> is west.
Also, since pointers are inherently directional,
it will be necessary for the linked-to room
to have its own pointer back to the original room
if the actor is to be able to return.
This means that we can create
deliberately confusing situations if we wish,
such as one-way corridors,
or rooms with exits that don't take you back to where you just came from.)
</p><p>When linking objects and rooms together,
we'll make heavy use of null pointers.
The end of a linked list is indicated by a null pointer--that is,
the last object in the list
has a <TT>next</TT> pointer of null.
A room with no objects,
or an actor with no possessions,
will have a null pointer in its <TT>contents</TT> field.
When a room has a wall instead of a door
in one of the four compass directions
(that is, when it's impossible to leave a room in a particular direction)
that will be indicated by a null pointer
in the corresponding cell of the <TT>exits</TT> array.
