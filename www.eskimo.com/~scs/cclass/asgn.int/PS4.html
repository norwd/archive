<p><B>Exercises:
</B></p><OL><li>This week we're going to add containers
(so that objects can be put inside of other objects)
and attributes,
so that we can remember things about objects
(such as whether they're containers, whether they're open, etc.).
<br>
<br>
The code to implement these changes is scattered,
and not all of it is
in the distribution directories.
You'll have to type some of this new code in yourself.
<br>
<br>
Here is the modified object structure,
along with a few definitions:
<pre>
struct object
	{
	char name[MAXNAME];
	unsigned int attrs;
	struct object *contents;	/* contents (if container) */
	struct object *lnext;		/* next in list of contained objects */
					/* (i.e. in this object's container) */
	char *desc;			/* long description */
	};

#define CONTAINER	0x0001
#define CLOSABLE	0x0002
#define OPEN		0x0004
#define HEAVY		0x0008
#define BROKEN		0x0010
#define TOOL		0x0020
#define SOFT		0x0040
#define SHARP		0x0080
#define LOCK		0x0100
#define KEY		0x0200
#define LOCKED		0x0400
#define TRANSPARENT	0x0800
#define IMMOBILE	0x1000

#define Iscontainer(o) ((o)-&gt;attrs &amp; CONTAINER)
#define Isopen(o) ((o)-&gt;attrs &amp; OPEN)
</pre>
(This code is in the file <TT>game.xh</TT> in the <TT>week4</TT> subdirectory,
although the copy there is missing the new <TT>desc</TT> field for objects.)
<br>
<br>
Here is new code,
for <TT>commands.c</TT>,
to implement new ``open,'' ``close,''
and ``put (in)'' commands:
<pre>
else if(strcmp(verb, "open") == 0)
	{
	if(objp == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to open.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(Isopen(objp))
		{
		printf("The %s is already open.\n", objp-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!(objp-&gt;attrs &amp; CLOSABLE))
		{
		printf("You can't open the %s.\n", objp-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	objp-&gt;attrs |= OPEN;
	printf("The %s is now open.\n", objp-&gt;name);
	}

else if(strcmp(verb, "close") == 0)
	{
	if(objp == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to close.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!(objp-&gt;attrs &amp; CLOSABLE))
		{
		printf("You can't close the %s.\n", objp-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!Isopen(objp))
		{
		printf("The %s is already closed.\n", objp-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	objp-&gt;attrs &amp;= ~OPEN;
	printf("The %s is now closed.\n", objp-&gt;name);
	}

else if(strcmp(verb, "put") == 0)
	{
	if(objp == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to put.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!contains(player-&gt;contents, objp))
		{
		printf("You don't have the %s.\n", objp-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(cmd-&gt;preposition == NULL || strcmp(cmd-&gt;preposition, "in") != 0 ||
			cmd-&gt;xobject == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me where to put the %s.\n",
							objp-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!Iscontainer(cmd-&gt;xobject))
		{
		printf("You can't put things in the %s.\n",
							cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if((cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;attrs &amp; CLOSABLE) &amp;&amp; !Isopen(cmd-&gt;xobject))
		{
		printf("The %s is closed.\n", cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!putobject(player, objp, cmd-&gt;xobject))
		{
		/* shouldn't happen */
		printf("You can't put the %s in the %s!\n",
			objp-&gt;name, cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	printf("Now the %s is in the %s.\n",
			objp-&gt;name, cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
	}
</pre>
(This code is in the file <TT>week4/commands.xc</TT>.)
<br>
<br>
Here is a new version of <TT>newobject</TT>, for <TT>object.c</TT>,
that initializes the new object attribute and contents fields.
(It's also missing any required initialization
of the new long description field;
make sure you preserve yours.)
<pre>
struct object *
newobject(char *name)
{
struct object *objp;

if(nobjects &gt;= MAXOBJECTS)
	{
	fprintf(stderr, "too many objects\n");
	exit(1);
	}

objp = &amp;objects[nobjects++];

strcpy(objp-&gt;name, name);
objp-&gt;lnext = NULL;
objp-&gt;attrs = 0;
objp-&gt;contents = NULL;

return objp;
}
</pre>
Here is the new <TT>putobject</TT> function, for <TT>object.c</TT>.
(It's in <TT>week4/object.xc</TT>.)
<pre>
/* transfer object from actor to container */

putobject(struct actor *actp, struct object *objp, struct object *container)
{
struct object *lp;
struct object *prevlp = NULL;

for(lp = actp-&gt;contents; lp != NULL; lp = lp-&gt;lnext)
	{
	if(lp == objp)				/* found it */
		{
		/* splice out of actor's list */

		if(lp == actp-&gt;contents)	/* head of list */
			actp-&gt;contents = lp-&gt;lnext;
		else	prevlp-&gt;lnext = lp-&gt;lnext;

		/* splice into container's list */

		lp-&gt;lnext = container-&gt;contents;
		container-&gt;contents = lp;

		return TRUE;
		}

	prevlp = lp;
	}

/* didn't find it (error) */

return FALSE;
}
</pre>
Here is new code for the <TT>parsedatafile</TT> function
in <TT>io.c</TT>,
to read attributes for objects:
<pre>
	else if(strcmp(av[0], "attribute") == 0)
		{
		if(currentobject == NULL)
			continue;
		if(strcmp(av[1], "container") == 0)
			currentobject-&gt;attrs |= CONTAINER;
		else if(strcmp(av[1], "closable") == 0)
			currentobject-&gt;attrs |= CLOSABLE;
		else if(strcmp(av[1], "open") == 0)
			currentobject-&gt;attrs |= OPEN;
		else if(strcmp(av[1], "heavy") == 0)
			currentobject-&gt;attrs |= HEAVY;
		else if(strcmp(av[1], "soft") == 0)
			currentobject-&gt;attrs |= SOFT;
		else if(strcmp(av[1], "sharp") == 0)
			currentobject-&gt;attrs |= SHARP;
		}
</pre>
(This code is incomplete;
at some point you'll have to add cases for the other attributes 
defined
in <TT>game.h</TT>.)
<br>
<br>
Here are the ``break'' and ``cut'' commands
from <TT>commands.c</TT>,
modified to make use of a few attributes:
<pre>
else if(strcmp(verb, "break") == 0)
	{
	if(objp == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to break.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(cmd-&gt;preposition == NULL || strcmp(cmd-&gt;preposition, "with") != 0 ||
			cmd-&gt;xobject == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to break with.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!contains(player-&gt;contents, cmd-&gt;xobject))
		{
		printf("You have no %s.\n", cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!(cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;attrs &amp; HEAVY))
		{
		printf("I don't think the %s is heavy enough to break things with.\n",
							cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	objp-&gt;attrs |= BROKEN;
	printf("Oh, dear.  Now the %s is broken.\n", objp-&gt;name);
	}

else if(strcmp(verb, "cut") == 0)
	{
	if(objp == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to cut.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(cmd-&gt;preposition == NULL || strcmp(cmd-&gt;preposition, "with") != 0 ||
			cmd-&gt;xobject == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to cut with.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!contains(player-&gt;contents, cmd-&gt;xobject))
		{
		printf("You have no %s.\n", cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!(cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;attrs &amp; SHARP))
		{
		printf("I don't think the %s is sharp enough to cut things with.\n",
							cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!(objp-&gt;attrs &amp; SOFT))
		{
		printf("I don't think you can cut the %s with the %s.\n",
					objp-&gt;name, cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	printf("The %s is now cut in two.\n", objp-&gt;name);
	}
</pre>
Try to get all of this code integrated, compiled, and working.
You will probably have to add a few prototypes to <TT>game.h</TT>.
<br>
<br>
Once it compiles,
before you can play with the new features,
you will have to make some changes to the data file,
<TT>dungeon.dat</TT>, too.
Make the hammer heavy by adding the line
<pre>
	attribute heavy
</pre>
just after the line
<pre>
	object hammer
</pre>
Make the kettle a container by adding the line
<pre>
	attribute container
</pre>
just after the line
<pre>
	object kettle
</pre>
Add a knife object by adding the lines
<pre>
	object knife
	attribute sharp
</pre>
in one of the rooms.
Add a box object by adding the lines
<pre>
	object box
	attribute closable
</pre>
Now you should be able to break things with the hammer,
and put things into the kettle or box
(once you open the box).
The knife won't cut things unless they're soft,
so add an object with
<pre>
	attribute soft
</pre>
and try cutting it with the knife.
Once you put things into containers,
they'll seem to disappear;
we'll fix that in the next two exercises.
<br>
<br>
With these changes, the game suddenly explodes in potential complexity.
There are lots and lots of features you'll be able to add,
limited only by your own creativity and the amount of time you 
care to spend/waste.
I've suggested several changes and improvements below,
although you don't have to make all of them,
and you're not limited to these suggestions, either.
(You won't be able to add too many more attributes, though, 
without possibly running out of bits in an int.
We'll start using a more open-ended scheme for implementing 
attributes next time.
In the mean time, you could make
the <TT>attrs</TT> field
an <TT>unsigned long int</TT>
if you were desperate to add more attributes.)
<li>Modify the <TT>findobject</TT> function in <TT>object.c</TT> so 
that it can find objects when they're inside containers
(both in the actor's possession and sitting in the room).
The original implementation of <TT>findobject</TT>
has separate loops for searching the actor's list of objects
and the room's list of objects.
But now, when an object
(in either list)
is a container,
we'll need to search through <em>its</em> list of
(contained)
objects, too.
It will be easiest if you add a new function,
<TT>findobj2</TT>,

which searches for an object in any list of objects.
The code in <TT>findobj2</TT> will be just like
the old code in <TT>findobject</TT>
for searching the actor's and room's lists;
in fact, once you write <TT>findobj2</TT>,
you'll be able to replace the actor- and room-searching code
with simple calls to
<pre>
	findobj2(actp-&gt;contents, name);
</pre>
and
<pre>
	findobj2(actp-&gt;location-&gt;contents, name);
</pre>
Ideally,
your scheme should work even to find objects within objects 
within objects
(or deeper);
this will involve recursive calls to <TT>findobj2</TT>.
<li>Modify the <TT>takeobject</TT> function in <TT>object.c</TT>
so that it can also take objects which are sitting in containers
(both in the actor's possession and sitting in the room).
If a container is <TT>CLOSABLE</TT>, make sure it's <TT>OPEN</TT>!
<li>Rewrite the ``examine'' command
(in <TT>commands.c</TT>)
to mention some of the relevant attributes
(<TT>OPEN</TT>, <TT>BROKEN</TT>, etc.)
of the object being examined.
(Hint: this is a good opportunity to use the conditional or 
<TT>?:</TT> operator.)
<li>Modify the <TT>listobjects</TT> function in <TT>object.c</TT> to 
list the contents (if any) of objects which are containers.
Should it print the contents of closed containers?
(In a more complicated game, we might worry about transparency...)
<li>Implement objects which can be locked
(if they have the <TT>LOCK</TT> attribute).
Add a ``lock'' command to lock them
(i.e. to set the <TT>LOCKED</TT> attribute)
and an ``unlock'' command to unlock them.
Both ``lock'' and ``unlock'' should require 
that the user use a tool which has the <TT>KEY</TT> attribute.
(In other words, ``lock strongbox with key'' should 
work,
but ``lock strongbox with broom'' should not work.
But don't worry about trying to make certain keys fit only certain locks.)
Don't let objects be opened if they have the <TT>LOCK</TT> attribute
and are locked.
(You'll have to update the attribute-reading code in <TT>io.c</TT>
to handle the <TT>LOCK</TT>, <TT>KEY</TT>, and <TT>LOCKED</TT> attributes.)
<li>Implement a ``fix'' command which will let the user 
fix broken objects,
as long as the preposition ``with'' appears and the 
implement is an object with the <TT>TOOL</TT> attribute.
(You'll have to update the attribute-reading code in <TT>io.c</TT>
to handle the <TT>TOOL</TT> attribute.)
<li>Implement immobile objects that can't be picked up.
(You'll have to update the attribute-reading code in <TT>io.c</TT>
to handle the <TT>IMMOBILE</TT> attribute.)
