</B></p><OL><li>We're going to fix one of the more glaring deficiencies
of the initial implementation of the game,
namely that the description of the dungeon takes the form of
hard-compiled structure arrays in <TT>main.c</TT>,
such that the source code must be edited
(and in a tedious way, at that)
and the game recompiled
whenever we want to modify the dungeon.
(We're used to recompiling when we make changes to our programs,
but we shouldn't have to recompile when we make expected changes to our data.
Imagine if a spreadsheet program
required you to enter your worksheet expressions or data
with a C compiler and recompile each time!)
<br>
<br>
We're going to add code which can read the dungeon description
dynamically, at run time, from a simple, textual data file.
The file will describe the rooms,
the objects and which rooms they're initially in,
and the exits which interconnect the rooms.
As the file is read,
we'll dynamically assign new instances
of <TT>struct room</TT> and <TT>struct object</TT>
to define the rooms and objects which the data file describes.
We won't know how many room and object structures we'll need,
and we certainly won't know what descriptions they will contain,
so we'll abandon the <TT>rooms</TT> and <TT>objects</TT> arrays from <TT>main.c</TT>,
along with their cumbersome initializations.
We'll add (in <TT>objects.c</TT>) an allocation function,
<TT>newobject()</TT>,
which will return a pointer to a brand-new object structure
which we can use to contain some new object,
usually one
we've just read from the data file.
Similarly, we'll add a <TT>newroom()</TT> function to <TT>rooms.c</TT>
which will return a pointer to a brand-new room structure.
(We're not quite ready to do full-blown dynamic memory allocation yet,
so for now, the room and object allocation functions
will dole structures out of fixed-size arrays
which we'll arbitrarily declare as having size 100.
Naturally we'll keep track of how many structures are actually in use,
and complain if an attempt is made to use more than 100.
Since the allocation code is isolated
down within <TT>rooms.c</TT> and <TT>object.c</TT>,
only those modules will need rewriting
when we move to a more flexible allocation scheme;
the code which calls <TT>newroom()</TT>
and <TT>newobject()</TT> won't need to change.)
<br>
<br>
Appended to this assignment is a listing of a new file, <TT>io.c</TT>,
for doing the data file reading.
(This code is also on the disk
or at the ftp site,
in the <TT>week2</TT> subdirectory.)
<br>
<br>
Rip out the definitions and initializations of the <TT>objects</TT> 
and <TT>rooms</TT> arrays at the top of <TT>main.c</TT>;
also remove the initialization of <TT>actor</TT>
(but leave the definition).
At the top of <TT>main()</TT>,
before the initial call to <TT>listroom</TT>,
add the lines
<pre>
	if(!readdatafile())
		exit(1);

	gotoroom(&amp;actor, getentryroom());	/* put actor in initial room */
</pre>
<br>
<br>
Add the following code to <TT>object.c</TT>
(it can go near the top):
<pre>
#define MAXOBJECTS 100

static struct object objects[MAXOBJECTS];
static int nobjects = 0;

struct object *
newobject(char *name)
{
struct object *objp;

if(nobjects &gt;= MAXOBJECTS)
	{
	fprintf(stderr, "too many objects\n");
	exit(1);
	}

objp = &amp;objects[nobjects++];

strcpy(objp-&gt;name, name);
objp-&gt;lnext = NULL;

return objp;
}
</pre>
(This code is in the file <TT>object.xc</TT>
in the <TT>week2</TT> subdirectory.)
<br>
<br>
Add the following code to <TT>rooms.c</TT>
(it can go near the top):
<pre>
#define MAXROOMS 100

static struct room rooms[MAXROOMS];
static int nrooms = 0;

struct room *
newroom(char *name)
{
struct room *roomp;
int i;

if(nrooms &gt;= MAXROOMS)
	{
	fprintf(stderr, "too many rooms\n");
	exit(1);
	}

roomp = &amp;rooms[nrooms++];

strcpy(roomp-&gt;name, name);
roomp-&gt;contents = NULL;
for(i = 0; i &lt; NEXITS; i++)
	roomp-&gt;exits[i] = NULL;

return roomp;
}

struct room *
findroom(char *name)
{
int i;

for(i = 0; i &lt; nrooms; i++)
	{
	if(strcmp(rooms[i].name, name) == 0)
		return &amp;rooms[i];
	}

return NULL;
}

struct room *
getentryroom(void)
{
if(nrooms == 0)
	return NULL;
return &amp;rooms[0];	/* temporary */
}
</pre>
(This code is in the file <TT>rooms.xc</TT>
in the <TT>week2</TT> subdirectory.)
<br>
<br>
You'll also need the file <TT>fgetline.c</TT>,
which is appended behind the new <TT>io.c</TT>,
and also in the <TT>week2</TT> subdirectory.
<br>
<br>
After adding all the new code,
and any necessary prototype declarations to <TT>game.h</TT>,
the program should again compile and run,
but it will expect to find a data file named 
<TT>dungeon.dat</TT> in the current directory.
A sample <TT>dungeon.dat</TT> file
(corresponding to the old, hard-compiled game)
is included here
(and in the <TT>week2</TT> subdirectory).
Once you see how it works, you can start extending the dungeon
simply by modifying the <TT>dungeon.dat</TT> file.
<li>(tricky)
If you added long descriptions to rooms and objects last week,
devise and implement a way for those long descriptions to be 
read from the data file.
<li>(easier)
Expand the set of allowable exits from rooms.
Add the possibility of northeast, southeast, northwest, and 
southwest exits, or ``up'' and ``down'' 
exits, or all six.
Add commands to go in these new directions.
Modify the data file reading code in <TT>io.c</TT> to handle 
setting up the new exits.
