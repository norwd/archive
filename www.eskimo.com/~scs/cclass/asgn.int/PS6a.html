<p>Exercise 2.
<I>Modify <TT>io.c</TT> to recognize a new <TT>entrypoint</TT> line
in the data file.
</I><p>Here is the code I added to <TT>io.c</TT>.
Rather than calling <TT>findroom</TT> right away,
and face the possibility of the room not being defined yet,
I chose to just stash the name of the room away
(as a string),
and then try looking it up after the data file had been
completely read.
I added this declaration at the beginning of
<TT>parsedatafile</TT>:
<pre>
char *entryroom = NULL;
</pre>
I added this case to the main <TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> chain
in <TT>parsedatafile</TT>:
<pre>
	else if(strcmp(av[0], "entrypoint") == 0)
		{
		struct room *roomp;
		if(ac &lt; 2)
			{
			fprintf(stderr, "missing entry room name\n");
			continue;
			}
		/* don't bother to look up yet; just save name */
		entryroom = chkstrdup(av[1]);
		}
</pre>
I added this code at the end
of <TT>parsedatafile</TT>:
<pre>
if(entryroom != NULL)
	{
	struct room *roomp = findroom(entryroom);
	if(roomp != NULL)
		setentryroom(roomp);
	else	fprintf(stderr, "can't find entry room %s\n", entryroom);
	}
</pre>
Finally, I added the new <TT>setentryroom</TT> function in <TT>rooms.c</TT>:
<pre>
void
setentryroom(struct room *roomp)
{
entryroom = roomp;
}
</pre>
<p>Exercise 3.
<I>Think about what it would take
to use the <TT>cmdtab</TT> structure,
and the <TT>findcmd</TT> function,
to streamline the code that processes lines in the data file.
</I><p>It would initially seem straightforward to take each case in the
<TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> chain,
break it out to a separate function,
build a table
(an array of <TT>struct cmdtab</TT>)
linking the first words on lines in the data file
to the new functions for parsing those lines,
and finally call <TT>findcmd</TT>
(after reading each line)
to decide which function to call.
<p>The first problem you might face, though,
would be breaking up the old <TT>parsedatafile</TT> function.
It contains a number of local variables
(especially <TT>currentroom</TT> and <TT>currentobject</TT>)
which several of the parsing cases need access to.
Once you broke those parsing cases out into separate functions,
they'd need access to the (formerly local) variables somehow.
You'd probably have to make them global,
although you could restrict them to the source file <TT>io.c</TT>
by declaring them <TT>static</TT>.
<p>The next problem you'd face would be deciding which information
to pass to the broken-out functions.
Most of them use the <TT>av</TT> array to inspect the various
arguments and other words which appeared on the line they're parsing,
but for at least one way I wrote the long description reading code,
it needed to use the original
copy of the complete data file input line
(that is, the <TT>line</TT> array),
the copy that hadn't been
broken apart by <TT>getwords</TT>.
The obvious information to pass to each parsing function is
the <TT>ac</TT> count and the <TT>av</TT> array
(which are, not coincidentally,
quite similar to the <TT>argc</TT> and <TT>argv</TT> with which
<TT>main</TT> is traditionally called).
Would you have to pass along the unbroken <TT>line</TT> to all functions,
for the benefit of just the one or two that needed it?
(Remember, all the functions must accept the same argument list,
because one function call, using the function pointer in the
<TT>func</TT> field of the matching <TT>struct cmdtab</TT>
entry, will be calling all of them.)
<p>Finally, once you decided what information to pass to each
individual line parsing function,
you'd discover (if you've got strict prototype checking turned on
in your compiler, and if you used <TT>cmdtab.c</TT> and
<TT>cmdtab.h</TT> as they appeared in last week's handout),
that the compiler doesn't want you to create an array of
<TT>struct cmdtab</TT> with the <TT>func</TT> fields pointing
at your shiny new functions,
because the <TT>func</TT> field
(again, as it appeared in last week's handout),
is specifically a pointer to a function accepting
a <TT>struct actor *</TT>,
a <TT>struct object *</TT>,
and a <TT>struct sentence *</TT>,
which is almost certainly <em>not</em>
the set of data
you chose to pass to each data file parsing function.
You'd either have to revert the declaration of the <TT>func</TT>
field to
<pre>
	int (*func)();
</pre>
(as it was on the disk)
and turn off strict prototype checking,
or write a second whole version of <TT>struct cmdtab</TT> and
a second whole version of <TT>findcmd</TT> that used
<TT>func</TT> fields with a different prototype,
or play some
(fairly ugly)
games with function pointer casts.
