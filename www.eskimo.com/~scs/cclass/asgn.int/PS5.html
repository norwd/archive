(such as the <TT>attrs</TT> field
we added to the object structure last time)
are a perfectly reasonable data structure to use
for keeping track of a relatively small,
well-defined set of attributes.
However,
as we've already seen,
once we start trying to keep track of
the qualities and states of various objects in the game,
we quickly find ourselves using a welter of attributes.
There aren't enough bits in an <TT>int</TT>
(or even a <TT>long int</TT>)
to keep track of all the attributes we might eventually want.
Furthermore,
it becomes a nuisance
to have to <TT>#define</TT> a new mask in <TT>game.h</TT>
every time we invent a new attribute,
and to add another <TT>if</TT> clause
to <TT>parsedatafile</TT> in <TT>io.c</TT>
to map the <TT>attribute</TT> line in the data file
(a string)
to the corresponding mask constant.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, after using it for only a week or two,
we're going to rip out the bitmask-based attribute scheme
and replace it with something more open-ended and flexible.
Any object may have a list of attributes,
with each attribute represented by an arbitrary string.
We'll write a few functions for
setting, testing, and clearing these attributes,
so that they'll be convenient
for the rest of the program to manipulate.
While we're at it,
we'll get some
more
practice doing dynamic memory allocation
and using linked lists.
<br>
<br>
Since,
under this new scheme,
an object may have arbitrarily many attributes,
and since each attribute will be an arbitrary-length string,
we won't be able to use fixed-size data structures.
We'll use dynamically-allocated ones, instead,
which means that we'll be calling <TT>malloc</TT> a lot.
A cardinal rule of using <TT>malloc</TT> is that you <em>must</em>
check its return value to make sure that it did not return a null pointer.
If the program ever runs out of memory,
or some other problem causes <TT>malloc</TT> to return a null pointer,
and if your program accidentally uses that null pointer
as if it points to usable memory,
your program can and will fail in mysterious ways.
If, on the other hand,
you check <TT>malloc</TT>'s return value,
and print a distinct error message when it fails,
you'll at least know more or less exactly what the problem is.
<br>
<br>
If you have many places in your program
where you're doing dynamic allocation,
it may become a nuisance
to have to check return values at all of those places.
Therefore,
a popular strategy is to implement
a <dfn>wrapper function</dfn> around <TT>malloc</TT>.
The one we'll be using looks like this:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "chkmalloc.h"

void *
chkmalloc(size_t sz)
{
void *ret = malloc(sz);
if(ret == NULL)
	{
	fprintf(stderr, "Out of memory\n");
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
return ret;
}
</pre>
All <TT>chkmalloc</TT> does is call <TT>malloc</TT>,
check its return value,
and return it if it's not <TT>NULL</TT>.
(<TT>size_t</TT> is an ANSI C type for representing the sizes of objects,
and <TT>void *</TT> is the generic pointer type
which <TT>malloc</TT> and related functions return.)
But since <TT>chkmalloc</TT> never returns a null pointer,
its caller never has to check,
but can begin using the pointer immediately.
<TT>chkmalloc</TT> can guarantee never to return a null pointer
not because it implements some kind of a magical infinite memory space,
but rather

because it simply exits,
after printing an error message,
if <TT>malloc</TT> fails.
Thus, all tests for <TT>malloc</TT> failures
(and our strategy for dealing with
those failures)
are centralized in <TT>chkmalloc()</TT>.
<br>
<br>
The ``strategy'' of printing an error message and exiting
when <TT>malloc</TT> fails is an expedient one,
but it would not be ideal for all programs.
It assumes that
(a) an actual out-of-memory condition is unlikely, and
(b) the program won't have any cleanup to do
and won't mind if it's summarily terminated.
This strategy would <em>not</em>,
for example,
be acceptable for a text editor:
the editor might use arbitrary amounts of memory when editing a large file,
and the user would certainly <em>not</em> appreciate being dumped out,
without having the opportunity to save any work,
after trying to add
(say) the 1,000,001st character
to a huge file
which had just been typed in from scratch
over many hours.
However, for our little adventure game,
this is a perfectly adequate strategy,
for now at least.
<br>
<br>
You might argue that,
if out-of-memory conditions are unlikely,
we might as well skip <TT>chkmalloc</TT>,
call <TT>malloc</TT> directly,
and not check its return value.
This would be a bad idea,
because while actual out-of-memory conditions may be rare,
other kinds of <TT>malloc</TT> failures are not so rare,
especially in a program under development.
If you misuse the memory which <TT>malloc</TT> gives you,
perhaps by asking for 16 bytes of memory
and then writing 17 characters to it
(and this is all too easy to do),
<TT>malloc</TT> tends to notice,
or at least to be broken by your carelessness,
and will return a null pointer next time you call it.
When <TT>malloc</TT> returns a null pointer for this reason,
it can be difficult to track down the actual error
(because it typically occurred
somewhere in your code <em>before</em> the call to <TT>malloc</TT>
that failed),
but if we blindly used the null pointer which <TT>malloc</TT>
returned to us,
we'd only defer the eventual crash even farther,
and it might be quite mysterious,
much more so than a definitive ``out of memory'' message.
Therefore,
using a wrapper function like <TT>chkmalloc</TT> is a definite improvement,
because we get error messages as soon as <TT>malloc</TT> fails,
and we don't have to scatter tests all through our code to get them.
<br>
<br>
All we do have to do,
anywhere we call <TT>chkmalloc</TT>,
is <TT>#include "chkmalloc.h"</TT>,
which contains <TT>chkmalloc</TT>'s external function prototype declaration,
as well as a second convenience function
which we'll meet in a minute:
<pre>
extern void *chkmalloc(size_t);
extern char *chkstrdup(char *);
</pre>
Both <TT>chkmalloc.c</TT> and <TT>chkmalloc.h</TT>
are in the <TT>week5</TT> subdirectory of the source directories.
<br>
<br>
With <TT>chkmalloc</TT> in hand,
we can begin implementing the new attribute scheme.
First, we define this list structure:
<pre>
struct list
	{
	char *item;
	struct list *next;
	};
</pre>
<br>
<br>
Then, we rewrite the object structure to use a list,
instead of an <TT>unsigned int</TT>,
for <TT>attrs</TT>:
<pre>
struct object
	{
	char name[MAXNAME];
	struct list *attrs;
	struct object *contents;	/* contents (if container) */
	struct object *lnext;		/* next in list of contained objects */
					/* (i.e. in this object's container) */
	char *desc;			/* long description */
	};
#define Iscontainer(o) hasattr(o, "container")
#define Isopen(o) hasattr(o, "open")
</pre>
Notice that we have also rewritten the
<TT>Iscontainer()</TT> and <TT>Isopen()</TT>
macros,
to use the new <TT>hasattr</TT> function,
which we'll see in a minute.
(This suggests another benefit of having used those macros:
none of the code that ``called''
<TT>Iscontainer()</TT> or <TT>Isopen()</TT>
will need rewriting.
As we'll see,
though,
the code that has been using raw bit operations
to test and set the other attributes
will need rewriting.)
The old attribute bits (<TT>CONTAINER</TT>, <TT>OPEN</TT>, etc.)
are no longer needed.
<br>
<br>
We rewrite the <TT>newobject</TT> function in <TT>object.c</TT>
slightly,
to initialize <TT>attrs</TT> to a null pointer:
<pre>
struct object *
newobject(char *name)
{
struct object *objp;

if(nobjects &gt;= MAXOBJECTS)
	{
	fprintf(stderr, "too many objects\n");
	exit(1);
	}

objp = &amp;objects[nobjects++];

strcpy(objp-&gt;name, name);
objp-&gt;lnext = NULL;
objp-&gt;attrs = NULL;
objp-&gt;contents = NULL;
objp-&gt;desc = NULL;

return objp;
}
</pre>
(Actually, we could have left it as <TT>objp-&gt;attrs = 0</TT>,
because 0 is also an acceptable null pointer constant.)
<br>
<br>
Now,
here are the three new functions for testing, setting, and
clearing (``unsetting'')
attribute strings:
<pre>
/* see if the object has the attribute */

int
hasattr(struct object *objp, char *attr)
{
struct list *lp;

for(lp = objp-&gt;attrs; lp != NULL; lp = lp-&gt;next)
	{
	if(strcmp(lp-&gt;item, attr) == 0)
		return TRUE;
	}

return FALSE;
}

/* set an attribute of an object (if it's not set already) */

void
setattr(struct object *objp, char *attr)
{
struct list *lp;

if(hasattr(objp, attr))
	return;

lp = chkmalloc(sizeof(struct list));

lp-&gt;item = chkstrdup(attr);
lp-&gt;next = objp-&gt;attrs;
objp-&gt;attrs = lp;
}

/* clear an attribute of an object */

void
unsetattr(struct object *objp, char *attr)
{
struct list *lp;
struct list *prevlp;

for(lp = objp-&gt;attrs; lp != NULL; lp = lp-&gt;next)
	{
	if(strcmp(lp-&gt;item, attr) == 0)
		{
		if(lp == objp-&gt;attrs)
			objp-&gt;attrs = lp-&gt;next;
		else	prevlp-&gt;next = lp-&gt;next;
		free(lp-&gt;item);
		free(lp);
		return;
		}
	prevlp = lp;
	}
}
</pre>
(These functions are in the file <TT>object.xc</TT>
in the <TT>week5</TT> subdirectory.)
<br>
<br>
<TT>hasattr</TT> returns <TT>TRUE</TT> if an object has a certain
attribute;
it simply searches through the object's attribute list
looking for a matching string.
<TT>setattr</TT> sets an attribute;
if the object does not already have the attribute,
<TT>setattr</TT> allocates a new list structure,
by allocating a new list node,
allocating and copying the string,
and splicing the new node into the attribute list.
<TT>unsetattr</TT> clears an attribute by finding it in the list
and freeing both the list node structure and the string
(if a matching attribute is found).
<br>
<br>
To explain the call to <TT>chkstrdup</TT> in <TT>setattr</TT>,
we must say and think a little more about memory allocation.
It turns out that,
to be on the safe side,
<TT>setattr</TT> must allocate memory for the string defining the attribute.
It cannot assume that the string which was passed to it
was allocated in such a way
that it would be guaranteed to persist
for the life of this attribute on this object.
For example,
when we're reading a data file,
the passed-in attribute string will be sitting
in a buffer holding one line we've just read from the data file,
and
that buffer
will be overwritten when we read the next line.
Even if the passed-in string <em>were</em> allocated
in such a way that it would stick around,
<TT>setattr</TT> still couldn't use it directly,
but would still have to make a copy,
because <TT>unsetattr</TT> is always going to free the string,
so <TT>setattr</TT> better have allocated it.
Many times, the string passed to <TT>setattr</TT> will be
a pointer to a string constant in the source code,
and if <TT>setattr</TT> simply copied the pointer
rather than allocating and copying the string,
<TT>unsetattr</TT> might later try to free that pointer,
an operation which would fail since the pointer wasn't originally
obtained from <TT>malloc</TT>.
<br>
<br>
<TT>setattr</TT> could call <TT>strlen</TT>
to get the length of the string,
add 1 for the terminating <TT>\0</TT>,
call <TT>malloc</TT> or <TT>chkmalloc</TT>,
and copy the string in,
but since this is a common pattern
(and since it's easy to forget to add 1),
we encapsulate it in the function <TT>chkstrdup</TT>.
<TT>chkstrdup</TT> accepts a string,
and returns a pointer to <TT>malloc</TT>'ed memory
holding a copy of the string.
The ``<TT>chk</TT>'' in its name reflects the fact that,
like <TT>chkmalloc</TT>,
it never returns a null pointer,
even when <TT>malloc</TT> fails.
Here is <TT>chkstrdup</TT>'s definition:
<pre>
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

char *
chkstrdup(char *str)
{
char *ret = chkmalloc(strlen(str) + 1);
strcpy(ret, str);
return ret;
}
</pre>
(<TT>chkstrdup</TT> is also in <TT>chkmalloc.c</TT>.)
<br>
<br>
Now that we have the <TT>hasattr</TT>, <TT>setattr</TT>,
and <TT>unsetattr</TT> functions,
we unfortunately have quite a few changes to make.
Everywhere we have the pattern
<pre>
	<I>object</I>-&gt;attrs &amp; <I>ATTRIBUTE</I>
</pre>
(where <I>object</I> is any <TT>struct object</TT> pointer
and <I>ATTRIBUTE</I> is any attribute),
we must replace it with
<pre>
	hasattr(<I>object</I>, "<I>attribute</I>")
</pre>
Everywhere we have the pattern
<pre>
	<I>object</I>-&gt;attrs |= <I>ATTRIBUTE</I>
</pre>
we must replace it with
<pre>
	setattr(<I>object</I>, "<I>attribute</I>")
</pre>
And everywhere we have the pattern
<pre>
	<I>object</I>-&gt;attrs &amp;= ~<I>ATTRIBUTE</I>
</pre>
we must replace it with
<pre>
	unsetattr(<I>object</I>, "<I>attribute</I>")
</pre>
(As we mentioned, though,
anywhere we ``call''
the <TT>Iscontainer()</TT> or <TT>Isopen()</TT> macros
to test the <TT>CONTAINER</TT> or <TT>OPEN</TT> attributes,
we won't have to change anything.)
<br>
<br>
Finally,
the attribute-reading code in <TT>io.c</TT> is considerably simplified.
Here is the relevant code from <TT>parsedatafile</TT>:
<pre>
	else if(strcmp(av[0], "attribute") == 0)
		{
		if(currentobject == NULL)
			continue;
		setattr(currentobject, av[1]);
		}
</pre>
<br>
<br>
So, exercise 1
(which all of this text so far has been an elaborate prelude to)
is to add the functions and source files mentioned so far,
change all of the code that uses <TT>attrs</TT> to use the new
<TT>hasattr</TT>, <TT>setattr</TT>,
and <TT>unsetattr</TT> functions
(the changes should be confined to <TT>commands.c</TT>,
and to one line in <TT>object.c</TT>),
and make sure that the program still works.
<li>If you didn't use dynamically-allocated memory
to hold long object and room descriptions,
make that change now.
<li>Rewrite <TT>newobject</TT> in <TT>object.c</TT>
and <TT>newroom</TT> in <TT>rooms.c</TT>
to dynamically allocate
new structures,
rather than parceling them out of
the static <TT>objects</TT> and <TT>rooms</TT> arrays.
(Eliminate those arrays.)
<br>
<br>
Eliminating the <TT>rooms</TT> array has one unintended consequence.
Although using arrays
to hold the objects and rooms
was generally a nuisance in the long run,
we did take advantage of it in one situation:
during the initial setup of the dungeon,
while reading the data file,
we hooked up named room exits to other rooms
by calling the <TT>findroom</TT> function.
<TT>findroom</TT> had to be able to find a named room anywhere in the dungeon,
which meant that it needed a way to scan through the list of all rooms.
When rooms were held in an array,
scanning through the array was easy.
When we move to dynamically allocated room structures,
we must preserve this ability.
<br>
<br>
The fact that what we need is the ability to
``scan through the list of all rooms''
suggests the solution:
we'll keep a linked list of all the rooms.
We don't need to define and implement a new list structure or anything;
we can just add a ``next'' pointer to <TT>struct room</TT>.
This next pointer won't be used for any purpose
which the user playing the game will be able to see--as
far as the user is concerned,
the only connections
(pointers)
between rooms are the ones described by the room's explicit exits.
This new <TT>next</TT> field for <TT>struct room</TT>
will be for our own, internal, behind-the-scenes use,
so that we can implement this list of all rooms.
<li>Improve the code in <TT>io.c</TT>
so that room exit lists can be placed directly in the room descriptions,
rather than at the end.
If an exit refers to a room you've already seen,
you can hook up the exit immediately.
But if the exit refers to a room you haven't seen yet,
you'll have to allocate some temporary data structure
to keep track of the source room, direction, and destination.
Then, after you've read the entire data file,
you can go back through that list of unresolved exits,
since all of the destinations <em>should</em> exist by that point.
(If any don't, you can print an error message.)
