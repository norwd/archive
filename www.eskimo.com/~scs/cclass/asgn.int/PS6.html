<p><B>Exercises:
</B></p><OL><li>In this exercise, we'll almost completely rewrite <TT>commands.c</TT>
so that instead of having a giant <TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> chain,
with many calls to <TT>strcmp</TT>
and the code for all the actions interspersed,
there will be one function per command,
a table relating command verbs to the corresponding functions,
and some much simpler code
which will look up a command verb in the table
and decide which function to call.
The functions in the table will,
of course,
be referred to by function pointers.
<br>
<br>
In the <TT>week6</TT> subdirectory of the distribution materials
are two new files, <TT>cmdtab.c</TT> and <TT>cmdtab.h</TT>,
and a modified
(though incomplete)
copy of <TT>commands.c</TT>.
<TT>cmdtab.h</TT> defines the command table structure,
<TT>struct cmdtab</TT>:
<pre>
struct cmdtab
	{
	char *name;
	int (*func)(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
	};

extern struct cmdtab *findcmd(char *, struct cmdtab [], int);
</pre>
<br>
<br>
With this structure in hand, the first thing to do
is to declare a bunch of functions,
one for each command,
and then build the ``command table,''
which is an array of <TT>struct cmdtab</TT>.
All of the command functions are going to take as arguments
the actor (<TT>struct actor *</TT>),
the object being acted upon (<TT>struct object *</TT>, if any),
and the complete sentence structure (<TT>struct sentence *</TT>)
describing the command we're trying to interpret/implement.
(The object being acted upon is the direct object of the sentence
and could also be pulled out of the sentence structure;
we're passing it as a separate argument
because that might make things more convenient
for the command functions themselves.)
Here, then, is the command table,
incorporating all the commands we've ever used
(your copy of the game might not include all of the commands referenced here):
<pre>
static int dircmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int takecmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int dropcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int lookcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int invcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int examcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int hitcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int breakcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int fixcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int cutcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int readcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int opencmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int closecmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int lockcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int unlockcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int putcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int helpcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);
static int quitcmd(struct actor *, struct object *, struct sentence *);

static struct cmdtab commands[] =
	{
	"n",		dircmd,
	"north",	dircmd,
	"s",		dircmd,
	"south",	dircmd,
	"e",		dircmd,
	"east",		dircmd,
	"w",		dircmd,
	"west",		dircmd,
	"ne",		dircmd,
	"northeast",	dircmd,
	"se",		dircmd,
	"southeast",	dircmd,
	"nw",		dircmd,
	"northwest",	dircmd,
	"sw",		dircmd,
	"southwest",	dircmd,
	"up",		dircmd,
	"down",		dircmd,
	"take",		takecmd,
	"drop",		dropcmd,
	"look",		lookcmd,
	"i",		invcmd,
	"inventory",	invcmd,
	"examine",	examcmd,
	"hit",		hitcmd,
	"break",	breakcmd,
	"fix",		fixcmd,
	"cut",		cutcmd,
	"read",		readcmd,
	"open",		opencmd,
	"close",	closecmd,
	"lock",		lockcmd,
	"unlock",	unlockcmd,
	"put",		putcmd,
	"?",		helpcmd,
	"help",		helpcmd,
	"quit",		quitcmd,
	};
</pre>
<br>
<br>
With this structure defined, the body of <TT>docommand</TT>
is drastically simplified.
In fact, since we'll break the searching of the command table
out to a separate function,
all the new <TT>docommand</TT> has to do is call that function,
then (if the command is found)
call the command function associated with the command:
<pre>
docommand(struct actor *player, struct sentence *cmd)
{
struct cmdtab *cmdtp;

cmdtp = findcmd(cmd-&gt;verb, commands, Sizeofarray(commands));

if(cmdtp != NULL)
	{
	(*cmdtp-&gt;func)(player, cmd-&gt;object, cmd);
	return TRUE;
	}
else	{
	printf("I don't know the word \"%s\".\n", cmd-&gt;verb);
	return FALSE;
	}
}
</pre>
The new <TT>findcmd</TT> function wants to know
(as its third argument)
the number of entries in the command table.
It would be a nuisance if we had to count them,
and we'd have to keep updating our count each time
we added an entry to the table.
The built-in <TT>sizeof</TT> operator can tell us the size of the array,
but it tells us the size in bytes,
while we want to know the number of entries.
But the number of entries is
the size of the array in bytes divided by the size of one entry in bytes,
or
<pre>
	sizeof(commands) / sizeof(commands[0])
</pre>
(here we get a handle on ``the size of one entry''
by arbitrarily taking <TT>sizeof(commands[0])</TT>).
Since this is a common operation,
I like to define a function-like macro to encapsulate it:
<pre>
	#define Sizeofarray(a) (sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]))
</pre>
With that definition in place,
the number of entries in the <TT>commands</TT> array is simply
<TT>Sizeofarray(commands)</TT>.
<br>
<br>
Here is the <TT>findcmd</TT> function, from <TT>cmdtab.c</TT>:
<pre>
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include "cmdtab.h"

struct cmdtab *
findcmd(char *cmd, struct cmdtab cmdtab[], int ncmds)
{
int i;

for(i = 0; i &lt; ncmds; i++)
	{
	if(strcmp(cmdtab[i].name, cmd) == 0)
		return &amp;cmdtab[i];
	}

return NULL;
}
</pre>
<br>
<br>
The ``only'' thing left to do
is to write all of the individual command functions.
The code for all of them
will come from the corresponding <TT>if</TT> clause
from the old, bulky version of <TT>docommand</TT>.
For example, here is <TT>takecmd</TT>:
<pre>

static int
takecmd(struct actor *player, struct object *objp,
					struct sentence *cmd)
{
	if(objp == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to take.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(contains(player-&gt;contents, objp))
		{
		printf("You already have the %s.\n", objp-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(hasattr(objp, "immobile"))
		{
		printf("The %s cannot be picked up.\n", objp-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!takeobject(player, objp))
		{
		/* shouldn't happen */
		printf("You can't pick up the %s.\n", objp-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	printf("Taken.\n");

return SUCCESS;
}
</pre>
With one exception,
all of the rest of the command functions are similar;
they just have
<pre>
	static int
	<I>xxx</I>cmd(struct actor *actor, struct object *objp,
					struct sentence *cmd)
	{
	...
	return SUCCESS;
	}
</pre>
wrapped around the code that used to be in one of the
<pre>
	else if(strcmp(verb, "<I>xxx</I>") == 0)
		{
		...
		}
</pre>
blocks.
<br>
<br>
(Although the copy of <TT>commands.c</TT> in the <TT>week6</TT> subdirectory
reflects this structure,
you probably won't be able to use that file directly,
because it does not reflect
all of the many
changes and additions
we've been making to <TT>commands.c</TT> over the past several weeks.)
<br>
<br>
The integer code <TT>SUCCESS</TT> that each of these functions is returning
isn't really used yet, so you don't have to worry about what it's for.
(Right now, <TT>docommand</TT> is ignoring the return value
of the called command function.)
<br>
<br>
The one command function that doesn't quite fit the pattern is <TT>dircmd</TT>,
because it's called for any of the direction commands,
and has to take another look at the command verb
to see what direction it represents:
<pre>
static int
dircmd(struct actor *player, struct object *objp,
					struct sentence *cmd)
{
struct room *roomp = player-&gt;location;
char *verb = cmd-&gt;verb;
int dir;

if(strcmp(verb, "n") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "north") == 0)
	dir = NORTH;
else if(strcmp(verb, "s") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "south") == 0)
	dir = SOUTH;
else if(strcmp(verb, "e") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "east") == 0)
	dir = EAST;
else if(strcmp(verb, "w") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "west") == 0)
	dir = WEST;
else if(strcmp(verb, "ne") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "northeast") == 0)
	dir = NORTHEAST;
else if(strcmp(verb, "se") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "southeast") == 0)
	dir = SOUTHEAST;
else if(strcmp(verb, "nw") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "northwest") == 0)
	dir = NORTHWEST;
else if(strcmp(verb, "sw") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "southwest") == 0)
	dir = SOUTHWEST;
else if(strcmp(verb, "up") == 0)
	dir = UP;
else if(strcmp(verb, "down") == 0)
	dir = DOWN;
else	return ERROR;

if(roomp == NULL)
	{
	printf("Where are you?\n");
	return ERROR;
	}

/* If the exit does not exist, or if gotoroom() fails,	*/
/* the player can't go that way.			*/

if(roomp-&gt;exits[dir] == NULL || !gotoroom(player, roomp-&gt;exits[dir]))
	{
	printf("You can't go that way.\n");
	return ERROR;
	}

/* player now in new room */

listroom(player);

return SUCCESS;
}
</pre>
This function also returns another status code, <TT>ERROR</TT>
(which is also ignored, for now, by <TT>docommand</TT>).
If your copy of <TT>game.h</TT> doesn't include them,
you can put the lines
<pre>
	#define ERROR	0
	#define SUCCESS	1
</pre>
in it to <TT>#define</TT> these values.
<li>Modify <TT>io.c</TT> to recognize a new <TT>entrypoint</TT> line
in the data file,
which will list the name of the room
which the actor should be placed in to start.
What if the <TT>entrypoint</TT> line
precedes the description of the room it names?
How should the code in <TT>io.c</TT> record the entry-point room
so that <TT>getentryroom</TT> in <TT>rooms.c</TT> can use it?
(There are many answers to these questions;
pick one, and implement it.)
<li>Another part of the game
that has the same sort of large,
<TT>if</TT>/<TT>strcmp</TT>/<TT>else</TT> structure
as did <TT>docommand</TT> in <TT>commands.c</TT>
is
<TT>parsedatafile</TT> in <TT>io.c</TT>.
Think about what it would take
to use the <TT>cmdtab</TT> structure,
and the <TT>findcmd</TT> function,
to streamline the code that processes lines in the data file.
<br>
<br>
(If you try it, you'll probably run into some difficulties
which will make it rather hard to finish,
so save a copy of <TT>io.c</TT> before you start!
In the answers handed out next week,
I'll describe the difficulties,
and outline how they might be circumvented.)
