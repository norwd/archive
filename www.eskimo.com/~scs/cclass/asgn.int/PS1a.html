<B>Assignment #1 ANSWERS
</B><br>
<br>
<p>Question 1.
<I>What are the four parts of a structure definition?
</I><p>The keyword <TT>struct</TT>,
the structure tag (optional),
the brace-enclosed list of member declarations (optional),
and a list of variables of this structure type to be declared (optional).
<p>Exercise 2.
<I>Add a ``help'' command.
</I><p>Here is the code I added
to the big <TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> chain
in <TT>commands.c</TT>:
<pre>
else if(strcmp(verb, "help") == 0)
	{
	printf("Here are some useful commands:\n");
	printf("n, north\tgo north\n");
	printf("s, south\tgo south\n");
	printf("e, east\t\tgo east\n");
	printf("w, west\t\tgo west\n");
	printf("look\t\tdescribe current room\n");
	printf("examine obj\tdescribe an object\n");
	printf("take obj\tpick up an object\n");
	printf("drop obj\tdrop an object\n");
	printf("i, inventory\tlist your current possessions\n");
	printf("There may be other commands, too!\n");
	}
</pre>
(This help text also contains a description
of the new ``examine'' command, below.)
<p>Exercise 3.
<I>Add a ``long description'' field
to the <TT>object</TT> and <TT>room</TT> structures.
</I><p>I added the line
<pre>
	char *desc;
</pre>
at the end of the definition of <TT>struct object</TT> in <TT>game.h</TT>,
and also
at the end of <TT>struct room</TT>.
I modified the initializations of the <TT>objects</TT> and 
<TT>rooms</TT> arrays in <TT>main.c</TT> to give most of the objects 
and rooms descriptions:
<pre>
static struct object objects[] =
	  {
/* [0] */ {"bed", NULL, "It is an old, four-poster bed with a lace coverlet."},
/* [1] */ {"diamond", NULL,
		"The diamond twinkles majestically as you hold it in the light."},
/* [2] */ {"kettle", NULL,
		"It is a dented old kettle.  You're not sure it would even hold water."},
/* [3] */ {"hammer", NULL},
/* [4] */ {"pliers", &amp;objects[3]},
/* [5] */ {"doormat", NULL, "It says, \"Welcome\", in big, friendly letters."},
/* [6] */ {"pick", NULL, "It is an old miner's pick."},
/* [7] */ {"shovel", &amp;objects[6]},
	  };
</pre>
<pre>
static struct room rooms[] =
	   {
/* [0]  */ {"field", NULL, {&amp;rooms[1], NULL, NULL, NULL},
		"You are in an open field, with a house to the north."},
/* [1]  */ {"house", NULL, {&amp;rooms[2], &amp;rooms[0], NULL, NULL},
		"You are standing just to the south of a plain, white house."},
/* [2]  */ {"entry", NULL, {&amp;rooms[3], &amp;rooms[2], &amp;rooms[5], NULL},
		"You are in the entryway of the house.\n\
A hall leads north, and there are doors to the south and east."},
/* [3]  */ {"hall", NULL, {&amp;rooms[6], &amp;rooms[2], NULL, &amp;rooms[4]},
		"You are in a north-south hallway, with a door to the west."},
/* [4]  */ {"bedroom", &amp;objects[0], {NULL, NULL, &amp;rooms[3], NULL},
		"You are in what looks like a bedroom.  The exit is to the east."},
/* [5]  */ {"closet", &amp;objects[1], {NULL, NULL, NULL, &amp;rooms[2]}},
/* [6]  */ {"kitchen", &amp;objects[2], {&amp;rooms[9], &amp;rooms[3], &amp;rooms[7], NULL},
		"You are in the kitchen of the house.\n\
Doorways lead north and south, and there is a stairwell to the east."},
/* [7]  */ {"stairway", NULL, {NULL, NULL, &amp;rooms[6], &amp;rooms[8]},
		"You are in a stairway twisting down beneath the kitchen."},
/* [8]  */ {"basement", &amp;objects[4], {NULL, NULL, &amp;rooms[7], &amp;rooms[10]},
		"You are in a dank basement.  There is a stairway to the east.\n\
It looks like someone has been digging at the west end!"},
/* [9]  */ {"porch", &amp;objects[5], {NULL, &amp;rooms[6], NULL, NULL},
		"You are on the back porth of the house.\n"
		"There is a doorway to the south."},
/* [10] */ {"tunnel", &amp;objects[7], {NULL, NULL, &amp;rooms[8], NULL},
		"You are in a low east-west tunnel, recently dug.\n"
		"The earth seems soft; you wonder how safe the ceiling is."},
	   };
</pre>
(Initializing long descriptions in this way is <em>not</em> convenient,
because the strings are, well, too long.
I even embedded <TT>\n</TT> within some of the strings,
to make them print on several lines,
and I continued some of them over two lines in the source code,
just to make them fit on the page.
You will notice that there are two ways of doing this:
The descriptions of the entry, kitchen, and basement
are extended onto the next line
using <TT>\</TT> as a continuation character.
The descriptions of the porch and tunnel are split into two strings,
on two separate lines but with no comma or other punctuation between them;
this means that the strings are automatically spliced together at compile time,
to form the equivalent of a single string.
But if you don't use either of these methods,
if you break a string constant across two lines
without using <TT>\</TT> or splitting it into two strings to be concatenated,
the compiler complains.)
<p>I added this code
to the big <TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> chain
in <TT>commands.c</TT>,
to implement an ``examine'' command:
<pre>
else if(strcmp(verb, "examine") == 0)
	{
	if(object == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to examine.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	objp = findobject(player, object);
	if(objp == NULL)
		{
		printf("I see no %s here.\n", object);
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(objp-&gt;desc == NULL || *objp-&gt;desc == '\0')
		printf("You see nothing special about the %s.\n", object);
	else	printf("%s\n", objp-&gt;desc);
	}
</pre>
Finally, I rewrote the <TT>listroom</TT> function in 
<TT>rooms.c</TT> to look like this:
<pre>
void
listroom(struct actor *actor)
{
struct room *roomp = actor-&gt;location;
if(roomp == NULL)
	{
	printf("Where are you?\n");
	return;
	}
printf("%s\n", roomp-&gt;name);
if(roomp-&gt;desc != NULL &amp;&amp; *roomp-&gt;desc != '\0')
	printf("%s\n", roomp-&gt;desc);
if(roomp-&gt;contents != NULL)
	{
	printf("room contains:\n");
	listobjects(roomp-&gt;contents);
	}
}
</pre>
