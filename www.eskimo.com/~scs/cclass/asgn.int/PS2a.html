<p>Question 1.
<I>List some differences between text and binary data files.
</I><p>Text files store lines of characters,
intended to be human-readable
if printed,
displayed to the screen,
read into a text editor, etc.
Binary files contain arbitrary byte values
which make little or no sense if interpreted as characters.
<p>Binary files may be smaller,
and if read and written in a simpleminded way,
they may be more efficient to read and write,
and the code to do so may be easier to write.
Text files tend to be larger,
to take longer
(than binary files)
to read and write,
and to require more elaborate code.
(However, if binary files are read in safer ways,
or written in more portable ways,
the code to do so is as complicated as for text files,
and will probably be intermediate in efficiency
between text files and simpleminded binary files.)
<p>Text files are quite portable.
Binary files will not necessarily work if they are moved
between machines having different word sizes or data formats,
or between compilers which lay out data structures differently in memory.
<p>It's easy to create, inspect, and modify text files using standard tools.
Binary file maintenance generally requires specially-written tools.
<p>Binary files must be written using <TT>fopen</TT> mode <TT>"wb"</TT>
and read using mode <TT>"rb"</TT>
<p>Exercise 2.
<I>Devise and implement a way for
long descriptions to be read from the data file.
</I><p>There are many ways of doing this.
All are a bit tricky,
given certain constraints imposed by the existing code.
<p>The most obvious way is to use lines of the form
<pre>
	desc You are in a dark and gloomy cave.
</pre>
in the data file.
(Such lines could of course be used for objects as well.)
The only problem with this approach
is that in the existing data file reading code in <TT>io.c</TT>,
each line read from the data file
is immediately broken up into words by calling <TT>getwords</TT>,
and this break-up happens
before it's decided
what keyword began the line
and what's to be done with the rest of the information on the line.
In the case of long descriptions,
we want the rest of the text on the line
(after the keyword <TT>desc</TT>)
to be treated as a single string,
not a series of individual words.
<p>One way around this problem
is to make a copy of the line read from the data file
before breaking it up with <TT>getwords</TT>.
I declared a second array
<pre>
	char line2[MAXLINE];
</pre>
at the top of <TT>parsedatafile</TT> in <TT>io.c</TT>,
and changed the old line
<pre>
	ac = getwords(line, av, MAXARGS);
</pre>
to
<pre>
	strcpy(line2, line);
	ac = getwords(line2, av, MAXARGS);
</pre>
Now <TT>line2</TT> is broken up by <TT>getwords</TT>
(and <TT>av</TT> ends up containing pointers into <TT>line2</TT>),
but the contents of <TT>line</TT> remain intact.
<p>Then I added this case
to the <TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> chain
that makes up the bulk of <TT>parsedatafile</TT>:
<pre>
	else if(strcmp(av[0], "desc") == 0)
		{
		char *p;
		for(p = line; *p != '\0' &amp;&amp; !isspace(*p); p++)	/* skip "desc" */
			;
		for(; isspace(*p); p++)				/* skip whitespace */
			;
		if(currentobject != NULL)
			currentobject-&gt;desc = chkstrdup(p);
		else if(currentroom != NULL)
			currentroom-&gt;desc = chkstrdup(p);
		else	fprintf(stderr, "desc not in object or room\n");
		}
</pre>
The code has two more troublesome spots:
first,
since the <TT>line</TT> array hasn't been broken into words
(which was the point, so as not to break up the descriptive text),
we have to manually skip over
the keyword ``<TT>desc</TT>'' and the whitespace
to find the beginning of the description itself.
Second,
since I've declared the long descriptions
in the object and room structures
as <TT>char *</TT>,
I have to allocate memory
to hold a copy of the description.
I do that by calling the function <TT>chkstrdup</TT>,
which makes a duplicate copy of a string in newly-allocated memory,
checking the return value of the memory allocation for me
so that I don't have to.
(On another sheet you'll find
the code for <TT>chkstrdup</TT>
and another function <TT>chkmalloc</TT> which it calls.
<TT>chkstrdup</TT> is declared in <TT>chkmalloc.h</TT>;
both <TT>chkmalloc.c</TT> and <TT>chkmalloc.h</TT>
can be found in the <TT>week5</TT> subdirectory of the source tree.)
We'll have much more to say about dynamic memory allocation
in upcoming weeks,
so don't worry about the details of <TT>chkstrdup</TT> too much.
<p>If you chose to use character arrays
as the long description fields in the object and room structures,
you don't have to worry about memory allocation,
but can instead use something like
<pre>
	strcpy(currentobject-&gt;desc, p);
</pre>
to copy the long description to your array.
Just make sure you understand why
a single call to <TT>strcpy</TT> would <em>not</em> work
if <TT>desc</TT> is declared as <TT>char *</TT>,
and why the simple assignment
<pre>
	currentobject-&gt;desc = p;
</pre>
would not work
if <TT>desc</TT> was an array <em>or</em> a pointer
(for a different reason in each case).
<p>In a real game,
room descriptions are likely to be more like a paragraph in length,
so cramming them all onto one <TT>desc</TT> line in the data file
is quite cumbersome.
How could we spread them across multiple lines in the data file?
One way is by allowing multiple <TT>desc</TT> lines,
and arranging that they all get concatenated together
to form the complete description.
Here's how I implemented that:
<pre>
	else if(strcmp(av[0], "desc") == 0)
		{
		char *p;
		char *newstr;
		for(p = line; *p != '\0' &amp;&amp; !isspace(*p); p++)	/* skip "desc" */
			;
		for(; isspace(*p); p++)				/* skip whitespace */
			;
		if(currentobject != NULL)
			{
			if(currentobject-&gt;desc == NULL)
				currentobject-&gt;desc = chkstrdup(p);
			else	{
				newstr = chkmalloc(
					strlen(currentobject-&gt;desc) + 1
						+ strlen(p) + 1);
				strcpy(newstr, currentobject-&gt;desc);
				strcat(newstr, "\n");
				strcat(newstr, p);
				free(currentobject-&gt;desc);
				currentobject-&gt;desc = newstr;
				}
			}
		else if(currentroom != NULL)
			{
			if(currentroom-&gt;desc == NULL)
				currentroom-&gt;desc = chkstrdup(p);
			else	{
				newstr = chkmalloc(
					strlen(currentroom-&gt;desc) + 1
						+ strlen(p) + 1);
				strcpy(newstr, currentroom-&gt;desc);
				strcat(newstr, "\n");
				strcat(newstr, p);
				free(currentroom-&gt;desc);
				currentroom-&gt;desc = newstr;
				}
			}
		else	fprintf(stderr, "desc not in object or room\n");
		}
</pre>
Now the memory allocation is more complicated,
because when we already have a (partial) long description string
for a given room or object,
we have to allocate a new, longer one and free the old one.
(There's an easier way to do this,
involving another standard library memory allocation function
called <TT>realloc</TT>.
We'll see it later.)
<p>Another option would be to decide that
long descriptions span many lines on the data file,
followed by some terminator,
without having each descriptive line preceded by any keyword.
For example, we might have lines in the data file like this:
<pre>
	desc
	You are in a dark and gloomy cave.
	The air is stale and damp.
	In the shadows you can hear various squeaking and chattering noises.
	desc end
</pre>
Here, the word <TT>desc</TT> alone on a line
indicates that a long description follows,
up to the line containing <TT>desc end</TT>.
<p>I implemented that option like this.
Notice that the description-reading code
therefore has to make more calls to <TT>fgetline</TT>
(i.e. besides the main one
at the top of the loop in <TT>parsedatafile</TT>).
In this case,
we don't have to worry about
the allocation of <TT>line</TT> vs. <TT>line2</TT>,
and we also don't have to skip over anything
to find the start of each descriptive line.
<pre>
	else if(strcmp(av[0], "desc") == 0)
		{
		char *newstr;
		while(fgetline(fp, line, MAXLINE) != EOF)
			{
			if(strcmp(line, "desc end") == 0)
				break;

			if(currentobject != NULL)
				{
				if(currentobject-&gt;desc == NULL)
					currentobject-&gt;desc = chkstrdup(line);
				else	{
					newstr = chkmalloc(
						strlen(currentobject-&gt;desc) + 1
							+ strlen(line) + 1);
					strcpy(newstr, currentobject-&gt;desc);
					strcat(newstr, "\n");
					strcat(newstr, line);
					free(currentobject-&gt;desc);
					currentobject-&gt;desc = newstr;
					}
				}
			else if(currentroom != NULL)
				{
				if(currentroom-&gt;desc == NULL)
					currentroom-&gt;desc = chkstrdup(line);
				else	{
					newstr = chkmalloc(
						strlen(currentroom-&gt;desc) + 1
							+ strlen(line) + 1);
					strcpy(newstr, currentroom-&gt;desc);
					strcat(newstr, "\n");
					strcat(newstr, line);
					free(currentroom-&gt;desc);
					currentroom-&gt;desc = newstr;
					}
				}
			}
		}
</pre>
<p>Exercise 3.
<I>Expand the set of allowable exits from rooms.
</I><p>I modified the room structure in <TT>game.h</TT> like this:
<pre>
#define NEXITS 10

struct room
	{
	char name[MAXNAME];
	struct object *contents;
	struct room *exits[NEXITS];
	char *desc;			/* long description */
	};

/* direction indices in exits array: */

#define NORTH		0
#define SOUTH		1
#define EAST		2
#define WEST		3
#define NORTHEAST	4
#define SOUTHEAST	5
#define NORTHWEST	6
#define SOUTHWEST	7
#define UP		8
#define DOWN		9
</pre>
(By adding the new directions at the end of the array,
rather than interspersing them with the original four,
any array initializations
such as we used to have in <TT>main.c</TT>
would still work,
since it's legal to supply fewer initializers for an array
than the maximum number of elements in the array.)
<p>I added this code to <TT>docommand</TT> in <TT>commands.c</TT>:
<pre>
else if(strcmp(verb, "ne") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "northeast") == 0)
	dircommand(player, NORTHEAST);
else if(strcmp(verb, "se") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "southeast") == 0)
	dircommand(player, SOUTHEAST);
else if(strcmp(verb, "nw") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "northwest") == 0)
	dircommand(player, NORTHWEST);
else if(strcmp(verb, "sw") == 0 || strcmp(verb, "southwest") == 0)
	dircommand(player, SOUTHWEST);
else if(strcmp(verb, "up") == 0)
	dircommand(player, UP);
else if(strcmp(verb, "down") == 0)
	dircommand(player, DOWN);
</pre>
<p>I added this code to the <TT>roomexits</TT> case
in <TT>parsedatafile</TT> in <TT>io.c</TT>:
<pre>
			else if(strcmp(av[i], "ne") == 0)
				dir = NORTHEAST;
			else if(strcmp(av[i], "se") == 0)
				dir = SOUTHEAST;
			else if(strcmp(av[i], "nw") == 0)
				dir = NORTHWEST;
			else if(strcmp(av[i], "sw") == 0)
				dir = SOUTHWEST;
			else if(strcmp(av[i], "u") == 0)
				dir = UP;
			else if(strcmp(av[i], "d") == 0)
				dir = DOWN;
</pre>
