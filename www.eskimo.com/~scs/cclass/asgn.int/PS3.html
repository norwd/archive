</B></p><OL><li>Appended to this assignment are listings of
new versions of
<TT>commands.c</TT> and <TT>parser.c</TT>.
(I've only printed the first page of <TT>commands.c</TT>, because 
the rest doesn't change.)
These versions implement a slightly more sophisticated scheme
for parsing and representing commands;
they will handle sentences like
<pre>
	hit nail with hammer
</pre>
The new scheme involves this structure,
in <TT>game.h</TT>:
<pre>
struct sentence
	{
	char *verb;
	struct object *object;
	char *preposition;
	struct object *xobject;	/* object of preposition */
	};

</pre>
This structure can contain the verb, object, and prepositional phrase
of one of these sentences.
(Also, the object of the verb and the object of the preposition
are represented by object pointers, filled in by the command parser,
rather than simple object names.)
<br>
<br>
Replace your copies of <TT>parser.c</TT> and <TT>commands.c</TT>
with these new ones,
which can be found in the <TT>week3</TT> subdirectory.
Merge any of the commands you added (or other changes you made)
from your old <TT>commands.c</TT> into the new one.
In <TT>main.c</TT>,
replace the declarations of the variables <TT>verb</TT> and <TT>object</TT>
with the new variable
<pre>
	struct sentence cmd;
</pre>
which can contain the whole command,
and change the calls to <TT>parseline</TT> and <TT>docommand</TT>
to
<pre>
	if(!parseline(&amp;player, line, &amp;cmd))
		continue;

	docommand(&amp;player, &amp;cmd);
</pre>
You'll also need to change the prototype declarations for
<TT>parseline</TT> and <TT>docommand</TT> in <TT>game.h</TT>.
<br>
<br>
Although we can now <em>parse</em> these more-complicated commands,
we need a bit more machinery before we can <em>implement</em> any of them.
For now, here is a little ``hit'' command
(to be added to <TT>commands.c</TT>)
which will begin to give you a feel for what we'll be able to do:
<pre>
else if(strcmp(verb, "hit") == 0)
	{
	if(objp == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to hit.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(cmd-&gt;preposition == NULL || strcmp(cmd-&gt;preposition, "with") != 0 ||
			cmd-&gt;xobject == NULL)
		{
		printf("You must tell me what to hit with.\n");
		return FALSE;
		}
	if(!contains(player-&gt;contents, cmd-&gt;xobject))
		{
		printf("You don't have the %s.\n", cmd-&gt;xobject-&gt;name);
		return FALSE;
		}
	printf("The %s says, \"Ouch!\"\n", objp-&gt;name);
	}
</pre>
Add this command, too.
<li>Add some other commands, such as ``break'' or 
``cut'' or ``read''.
(They won't really do anything yet,
other than print little messages along the lines of the 
``hit'' command in exercise 1.)
<li>Write a function <TT>plural</TT>
with the prototype
<pre>
	char *plural(char *);
</pre>
which, given a string,
returns a new string with an ``s'' tacked on to the end.
Use this new function to rewrite some of the messages printed by 
the game from
<pre>
	printf("I see no %s here.\n", word);
</pre>
to
<pre>
	printf("I don't see any %s.\n", plural(word));
</pre>
Make an appropriate choice from among the techniques discussed 
in class for the allocation of the string returned by 
<TT>plural</TT>.
(Extra credit:
try to make <TT>plural</TT> a little smarter,
by adding ``es'' where appropriate.)
