<H2>NAME</H2>

filter - apply a filter to a set of files, in-place
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>filter</B>
[
<B>-bpsv</B>

command
files
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p><I>filter</I>
applies <I>command</I> to each of the listed <I>files</I>,
replacing each file with
the output of <I>command</I>
when run with that file as input.
The <I>command</I> must, therefore,
(and as this program's name suggests)
be a filter,
reading standard input
and writing some usefully modified rendition of it to standard output.
Typical <I>command</I>s are sed and tr.
</p><p><I>filter</I> pays attention to
the exit status of <I>command</I>
and does not replace an original file
if <I>command</I>
exits with an error status.
<I>filter</I> also attempts to preserve
the original file's permissions, ownership, and hard links,
although its ability to do so is somewhat dependent on
ancillary utilities which may not be universally available.
</p><p><I>filter</I>'s interpretation of its command line
is rather blunt:
the first argument is the command to be invoked;
the remaining argument(s) are the file(s) to be filtered.
</p><p>This syntax presents an obvious difficulty:
what if the command to be invoked itself takes some option flags or arguments,
or is otherwise multi-word?
The solution is simple: enclose the command string in quotes.
But this solution presents a further difficulty:
what if one of the command's arguments needs to be quoted?
The solution to <em>that</em> is either to quote some of the quotes,
or use two different kinds of quotes.
</p><p>For example,
suppose that <I>filter</I> is to be used
to invoke sed on a series of files,
where the sed command to be invoked must be quoted
(as it of course usually must be).
The complete invocation might look like this:
<pre>
	filter "sed 's/cannot/can not/g'" file1 file2 file3
</pre>
</p><p>(In extreme cases,
it may be easier to encapsulate a complicated filtering command
as a shell script
which can then be invoked as a single word,
although this is admittedly a nuisance.)
</p><p><I>filter</I> invokes
the specified <I>command</I> within
an extra shell <TT>eval</TT> layer,
meaning that an exotic invocation such as
<pre>
	filter "rev | sort | rev" file1 file2 file3
</pre>
will work as expected
(that is, each file will be filtered through the pipeline
``<TT>rev | sort | rev</TT>'').
</p><H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<I>filter</I> accepts a few options of its own:
<dl>
<dt><B>-b</B>
</dt><dd>Save a backup copy of each original input file,
before modification,
as <I>filename</I><TT>.bak</TT>.
</dd><dt><B>-i</B>
</dt><dd>Ignore any errors returned by <I>command</I>;
always replace the input file with the output.
</dd><dt><B>-p</B>
</dt><dd>Preserve the original modification times
of the files being filtered.
(This option may not be available in all versions of the program,
as it depends on ancillary utilities which may not be universally available.)
</dd><dt><B>-s</B>
</dt><dd>Do not replace an input file if the output of <I>command</I>
is no different from the input.
</dd><dt><B>-v</B>
</dt><dd>Verbose: print messages about all files filtered.
</dd><dt><B>-?, -h</B>
</dt><dd>Print a brief help/usage message.
</dd></dl>
