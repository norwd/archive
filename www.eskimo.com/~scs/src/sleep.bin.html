<H1>Precompiled Binaries</H1>
<p>
Here are compiled, binary, executable copies of
<a href="sleep.man.html">sleep</a>
for some of the machines I use.
<br>
(There are also detached PGP digital signatures
to help you verify that the files haven't been tampered with.)

<p>
Use these at your own risk!
It would be safer to download and compile the
<a href="sleep.c">source file</a>
yourself.
I can't guarantee that these binaries will work with
your Operating System kernel,
your shared C library, or your other shared libraries.
(I can guarantee that they don't contain any Trojan horses,
but you probably shouldn't trust anyone to say that.)
Also, not all of these may have been rebuilt to the latest source.
