dbm tools - shell access to dbm files
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<p>These tools provide shell-level access to Unix
<a href="../cgi-bin/manredir.cgi?name=dbm&amp;sec=3"><I>dbm(3)</I></a> files,
including <a href="../cgi-bin/manredir.cgi?name=ndbm&amp;sec=3"><I>ndbm(3)</I></a>
and <a href="../cgi-bin/manredir.cgi?name=gdbm&amp;sec=3"><I>gdbm(3)</I></a> variants.
The tools support storing, fetching, listing, and deleting
the nodes in <I>dbm</I> databases.
(There is a general presumption,
however, that the keys and to some extent the data are printable text.
These tools are of only limited utility for
<I>dbm</I> files containing arbitrary binary data.)
</p><p>There are five tools:
<a href="dbmstore.man.html"><I>dbmstore</I></a>,
<a href="dbmfetch.man.html"><I>dbmfetch</I></a>,
<a href="dbmdump.man.html"><I>dbmdump</I></a>,
<a href="dbmdelete.man.html"><I>dbmdelete</I></a>,
and 
<a href="dbmutil.man.html"><I>dbmutil</I></a>.
The first four map to the basic <I>dbm</I> operations:
store, fetch, first/next (i.e. ``list'' or ``dump'') and delete.
<I>dbmutil</I> combines all these functions and adds a few others,
and can be used in an interactive mode,
or to process scripts of <I>dbm</I> commands.
</p><p>The tools can be compiled in (at least) three different ways:
for the old <a href="../cgi-bin/manredir.cgi?name=dbm&amp;sec=3"><I>dbm(3)</I></a> library,
for the related Berkeley <a href="../cgi-bin/manredir.cgi?name=ndbm&amp;sec=3"><I>ndbm(3)</I></a> library,
and for the GNU <a href="../cgi-bin/manredir.cgi?name=gdbm&amp;sec=3"><I>gdbm(3)</I></a> library.
In the most general case,
the tools when compiled with the <I>dbm</I> library have names beginning with ``dbm''
(as mentioned in the previous paragraph),
the tools when compiled with the <I>ndbm</I> library have names beginning with ``ndbm'',
and when compiled with the <I>gdbm</I> library have names beginning with ``gdbm''.
In practice,
however,
there is no difference in file formats between the <I>dbm</I> and <I>ndbm</I> libraries,
so there is little point in compiling both the ``dbm...'' and ``ndbm...'' sets;
the choice will be constrained only by which of the libraries is available.
(Furthermore,
the <I>gdbm</I> library can emulate the <I>dbm</I> and <I>ndbm</I> libraries
at the function call level,
but using its own file format underneath,
so on systems without a true <I>dbm</I> or <I>ndbm</I> library,
but with <I>gdbm</I> and its emulations standing in for both,
all three sets of tools will end up using the same file format,
and therefore only one of the three is strictly needed.)
</p><p>Although these tools are, as mentioned,
intended for use with <I>dbm</I> files containing plaintext keys and values,
there is one consideration
if the <I>dbm</I> files are also being accessed by other C programs, namely:
do the keys and values as stored in the <I>dbm</I> files
contain terminating `<TT>\0</TT>' characters?
They need not have them
(because the <I>dbm</I> machinery maintains explicit lengths for both),
but storing the <TT>\0</TT> characters explicitly
makes it easier for a C program to treat a fetched datum as a string.
Therefore, these tools can be told
to use or not use extra <TT>\0</TT> characters at the end of keys and values.
By default, extra <TT>\0</TT> characters will not be used
(that is, will not be appended to keys and values when storing data,
and will not be appended to keys when looking up data),
but each tool accepts a <B>-n</B> flag
instructing it to append <TT>\0</TT> (``null'') characters
in all of these situations.
</p><p>(In a few cases,
controlled either by command-line flags
or conditional compilation options in the source code,
the tools can intuit whether or not the extra <TT>\0</TT> characters are present,
without having to be explicitly told.)
</p><p>There are also a few provisions made for data values
which are not so much text strings,
but miniature text files,
with trailing and perhaps internal newline characters.
There are also a few provisions made for data values
(but <em>not</em> keys)
which contain arbitrary binary data.
</p><p><I>dbm</I> and <I>ndbm</I> databases are stored as a pair of files,
with names ending in ``.dir'' and ``.pag''.
When naming the <I>dbm</I> file to be accessed by these tools,
either suffix is optional.
That is, for a <I>dbm</I> database stored in the files ``x.dir'' and ``x.pag'',
the file name given to these tools may be either ``x'', ``x.dir'', or ``x.pag''.
(What actually happens is that these tools strip off a .dir or .pag suffix,
if present,
before handing the name to the underlying
<I>dbm</I> or <I>ndbm</I> database opening function;
the underlying <I>dbm</I> or <I>ndbm</I> code then re-appends the suffixes, as required.)
For <I>gdbm</I> databases, on the other hand, only one file is used,
with no preordained suffix name,
so for the <I>gdbm</I> versions of these tools,
the file name handed to the tool much match the actual <I>gdbm</I> file name.
</p><p>In most cases,
the <I>dbm</I> file(s) are created automatically, if required
(typically when attempting to store data into a <I>dbm</I> file
which does not yet exist).
</p><p>Here are individual man pages for each of the commands:
<UL><li><a href="dbmstore.man.html">dbmstore</a>
<li><a href="dbmfetch.man.html">dbmfetch</a>
<li><a href="dbmdump.man.html">dbmdump</a>
<li><a href="dbmdelete.man.html">dbmdelete</a>
