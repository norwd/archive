      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Deleted the subfolder 
        "movies" from oca-down folder on the Server. This was MPEG video 
        waiting to go to the ground. All the tapes were sent down on 4A and ground 
        should be able to process these with higher quality than what we had stored. 
        Sergei moved photo files to the Wiener. Server "K" drive now 
        has more than 1 Gb. free storage, plus PC card, but we would still like 
        to know the overall plan as to how this is to be managed.</font>

        up on email and computer housekeeping. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We talk a bit about 
        the troubleshooting we did Saturday on the veloergometer. We had trouble 
        hooking up the Russian scopemeter to the charger, as we don't have 2 cables 
        we need to do it. ??? said later they thought cables were on the ground. 
        We used the US scope, although this thing really eats battery power.<br>
        Troubleshooting velo is turning out to be more than just a few resistance 
        checks. Diagram the ground sent up is a very high-level format which does 
        not show any real electrical detail. We got instructions to cut 2 connections 
        and isolate a large load resistor. The 2 connections are in fact 8 separate 
        wires. We decided not to cut anything until we better understand how the 
        control head is supposed to work. We set up to measure voltage across 
        one of the resistors . Yuri pedaled for about a minute and we saw a momentary 
        voltage spike of 13 volts, and then the output went flat. Ground said 
        expected output should have been 12 volts steady. We may try to snag this 
        signature on the scopemeter and send to the ground later, although we 
        are not sure we have the Fluke software onboard for the SSC to talk to 
        the scope.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Got the word through 
        Moscow that we would not be clearing out PMA 3 and venting today. This 
        is very good news.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Crew got in TVIS

        We're up and getting ready for the "Chibis" session. It's a 
        PAO day, so all the razors are out. We are going to have to do haircuts 
        soon.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">0750 First TV session 
        with ???, and since we don't have the scheduled Energia videocon, we say 
        happy New Year to a lot of the specialists in Moscow.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep does the CMG 
        reconfiguration for SSC 3 in the Node. We have everything set up here 
        so that we can get through this in about 40 minutes, counting all the 
        data logging. We voice the numbers to Houston and the CMGs seem happy.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">NCU and FPP experiment 
        restarted after the CMG data take. FPP application seems to be running 
        normally, although we are still not seeing visible traces on the plot.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri starts his Chibis 
        session-same routine as yesterday. An instrumentation pass and then the 
        full session in the apparatus on the following comm. pass. Sergei is doing 
        the setup, comm., and medical instrumentation. The whole process takes 
        about 2 &frac12; hours.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We do the MPV update 
        on the file server per the OCA note. MPV load does not seem to copy completely 
        and server has a number of error messages. We are apparently out of memory 
        space on the disk, although we're not sure exactly how NT manages its 
        memory. Wait to talk to Houston. We discuss this later in the day, and 
        then delete all the MPV files which frees up about 800 Mb. We also plug 
        in one of the 1 Gb PC cards, so at least for the short term, the server 
        has some more storage space. We would like to know a little more about 
        the long term plan to manage storage on the server--we were kind of wondering 
        when the hard drive was going to get full. Answered that question today.<br><br>
        Lunch and then another OCA media downlink through Houston. Comm was OK, 
        although some of the voice levels with the media contacts were low. At 
        the end of the two sessions, we sent down a New Year's message for media 
        release (see below).</font>

</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We have had intermittent 
        trouble with the ???'s hose for the toilet. The electrical switch which 
        activates the system has not been turning it off properly. It seems to 
        be some kind of intermittent open circuit, which we thought would get 
        lots better or lots worse soon. ??? said to change the hose out, but we 
        are still not sure that is the right fix to the problem, and we may be 
        throwing out a good hose. We asked to delay this while we keep watching 
        how it operates.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We reset the MEC 
        laptop time. It was about 1 minute off of the rest of the system. We are 
        wondering if the ground call to reset the clock had to do with the fact 
        that we logged an IRED workout yesterday as "29 December", as 
        that was the workout that was done, although the date was the 28 th. . 
        IRED program on the MEC does not have the flexibility to accommodate that 
        user change, but we will want to do this. <br><br>
        World map had problems again today. We got another vector that put us 
        on the Equator. If we could get a little more info on where the vector 
        is stored, and how clients get it, we could input this manually if we 
        get stuck again.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1700 Talked with 
        training lead for 5A and CAPCOM about the preliminary 5A material for 
        onboard training. We really like the browser format-this will save us 
        huge amounts of time. The prototype material for FD 4 is going to be very 
        useful. Kudos to the training team from all of us.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep and then Sergei 
        on the IRED. We got the note on IRED limits, and we are planning to mark 
        the canisters accordingly. We are doing 2 exercises right now which are 
        at or close to the "12" scale limit-and our adaptation to resistive 
        training in space is still pretty low. Bottom line-this thing is good, 
        but it is going to need more capacity-more resistance, and longer cables.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Finished the day 
        with comm. pass with Moscow-lots of folks on the shift saying hello, as 
        we will not hear from them till next year. </font>

        0714 First comm. pass with Moscow. It's "Chibis" day. Sergei 
        gets to do it today, Yuri tomorrow. we have an early TV downlink scheduled 
        so we are chowing down a quick breakfast and then cleaning up and putting 
        on our TV outfits.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">0830 TV downlink 
        with Moscow stations. Lots of questions how we spent Christmas day, what 
        the "house" looks like, other questions of general interest 
        about how we are living and getting along.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei ready for 
        the pre-Chibis instrumentation check. It's a lot of electrical equipment-Yuri 
        and Shep help get it all set up. First pass is just to verify all the 
        hookups and monitoring equipment is OK. One rev later, Sergei is in the 
        Chibis and it's pumping down. Pretty similar to the US LBNP test, although 
        this looks like it is done a bit quicker. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep spent the morning 
        rigging the plastic wire trays flown up on 2A.2B. Used all the 1" 
        white trays (about 25feet worth) just in the SM. Trays cut with scissors 
        and put down with velcro squares--this works well. They really clean up 
        wire runs inside the living spaces and SM is looking much neater. We are 
        passing an Email tonight to CAPCOM asking for more of this stuff as soon 
        as it can be manifested-we have a feeling the Lab will need it.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We got the IRED workouts 
        that came up in the mail. Nice spreadsheet formats. All 3 of us will be 
        using these. Shep put data for 12/28 workout on the MEC and sent it to 
        the server. Some minor issues with how the data is input, but in general, 
        this is workable. We are using IRED every day and all like it. </font>

        we missed another Earth Obs site, and we figure it could be for several 
        reasons-Yuri's laptop is gaining a couple of minutes each day. We usually 
        work with the world map on his SSC, and this may be throwing the map off. 
        Also, the Progress docking and attitude changes have most likely moved 
        our state vector. So that may be part of the problem. And we are still 
        getting vector uplinks that put us in zero inclination orbits-happened 
        again today.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After lunch, Shep 
        worked on the IMS database and bar code readers. Sergei and Yuri did air 
        sample monitoring, and then some acoustic data takes with the Russian 
        sound level meter.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We all started pulling 
        out the rest of the light trash in the Progress and preparing ???'s, ???'s, 
        and other wet trash for stowage. Surprised at how much light stuff came 
        out of Progress. We moved about 1 1/2 stowage racks worth of bags and 
        containers out and tied them down in the Node.</font>

        and examined the cable run from the NCU to the Node shell. It is properly 
        connected, and the line is "fair" ("no kinks" for 
        non-nautical types). FPP restarted without errors this time, and SSC readback

        starts early as usual. Sergei getting ready to install the GPS/GLONASS 
        satellite receiver (ACH). He has about 1 &frac12; hours scheduled to do 
        this, but the installation is way up on panel SM 338. Access is not good, 
        and lots of cables look like they were routed after the ACH box was installed. 
        They are all in the way. Sergei takes an hour just to scope out the installation 
        and plan how to do it. Job takes 4+ hours, but Sergei comments that it 
        would have been a full day's work if he had just started it without making 
        a good plan. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep gets an early 
        start on the FPP activation. Power down the SSC and switch the cabling. 
        SSC is now powered off the RFPDB box on the early comm. rack. Earlier 
        power problems seen on the UOP do not occur, and the SSC boots normally 
        with the parallel port to the FPP gear attached. Received 1 error message 
        when trying to talk to the NCU and called this to the ground. Otherwise, 
        program started normally. Data transfers are showing up in the screen 
        log on SSC, but no visible traces on the voltage plot on the lower screen. 
        Talked with Houston late in the day to discuss possible reasons for this. 
        Will check the NCU-Node shell cable set up tomorrow a.m. </font>

        pulling foam and light bags out of the Progress to make way for heavier 
        items. ??? would like the Kurs radar back as well. Yuri is unrigging all 
        the cabling so we can move stuff. Big Kurs box about the size of a small 
        refrigerator. Yuri and Shep pull this unit out and stow in the Node. Looks 
        very familiar in the forward part of the Node--we have the alcove around 
        the hatch full of bags again.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After lunch, Sergei 
        and Yuri continue pulling the rest of the Kurs boxes out, and looking 
        for extra connector caps to cover the bare sockets.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep gets "bilge 
        diving" quals renewed with the ACY hose and filter change. Lots of 
        help from Sergei and Yuri. Work goes surprisingly well, no leakage or 
        mess. Used hose is placed in a garbage bag (thanks, crew equipment!) and 
        stowed in the ???. ACY checks out OK, then won't shut down. Pull out the 
        drawings and we think the separator has a stuck switch. Yuri gives the 
        system a bit of flush water and we are back to normal. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep spends the rest 
        of the afternoon in the Node, putting bar codes on the Node rack and the 
        seat track beside the ZSR soft racks. Was going to work with the bar code 
        reader, but the 1 unit which is loaded with current software decided it 
        would lock itself in the RF mode. Could not get it to jump back to the 
        batch mode. Also, when the bar code application software is launched on 
        SSC 3 (in the Node) the SSC says that it can not talk to the server. SSC 
        3 is, however, talking on the network with other applications, so something 
        is different about how the server is handing BCR program. Shep tries the 
        same application on SSC 2 with the same result. All this worked yesterday, 
        and we are stumped. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Took a quick look 
        at the audit locations requested in the FGB. Panels 210, 311, 313 don't 
        have any stowage behind them. The rest have some gear stowed-mostly small 
        items. Checked the database against quick notes of what was in these locations. 
        Will do a full audit on these panels as we have time.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We got the SSC file 
        server backed up per the daily plan. Finally have this configured so we 
        don't have to change any hardware. Backup took a while. Kept getting messages 
        that "registry" was full, although backup eventually completed 
        itself. We believe that the server is trying to handle a lot of program 
        transactions, and this is taking most of the computing power it has.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All hands got some 
        time on the IRED and the TVIS. Ops normal. Did the TVIS weekly maintenance, 
        and we are getting light chafing on the plastic sheath for the SLD cables, 
        near the pulleys which feed the cable up off the TVIS running surface. 
        We will watch this.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Late in the day, 
        we are having discussions with Moscow and Houston about location of the 
        OCA. Convenience factor of having the OCA where we can continually hear 
        it and see it is strong, and we think regardless of where it is located 
        in the near term, that having it near PCS and SSC (on central post) for 
        lab activation and checkout should be a requirement.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We are thinking about 
        how to lay down some more wire trays-and how we will fasten them. The 
        best solution for right now seems to be velcro. Put some big squares down 
        on the tray in the Node and they are holding. We plan on rigging some 
        more of the small Shuttle-style trays in SM to trim up cable runs to the 
        laptops.</font>

        normal-no apparent oscillation. The TV image showed good lighting and 
        contrast. For the last 100m or so when Yuri was driving, the visibility

        0700Christmas morning. Stockings are hung on the ????. Yuri and Sergei 
        surprised with this tradition, but hey, that's what stockings are for. 
        We talk to ??? and give them a "Merry Christmas" also. We get 
        updates on the OCA schedule today-looks like several comm. passes have 
        been added. After the comm. pass we exchange some presents that Santa 
        must have left in the PMA.</font>

        to Moscow for taping. To be broadcast on New Year's Eve. At least no singing 
        on this one. Sergei sends down a quick video tour of station from the 
        camcorder. Russian media interest on "Alpha" activities has 
        been strong all week.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Phone patch with 
        Mr. Goldin on OCA. We try twice-good uplink, but comm. on the return link 
        is intermittent and unreadable. When we break the patch and go to Houston, 
        comm. is back solid. OCA had a busy day-we did at least 6 links today 
        with Houston, Moscow, and the phone patches. Many thanks to the OCA team, 
        GC's and the other folks on the ground who made this work. OCA comm. yesterday 
        with families in Star City was a very positive event, even though the 
        audio quality fell short. We would definitely like to do this again.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 5A training package 
        introduction arrived onboard in one of the OCA uplinks. We looked at it 
        briefly. This is good material, well laid out, and will save us lots of 
        time when we start focusing on what we should review. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei and Shep have 
        a discussion on how to work the IMAX schedule better for 5A. We don't 
        know how to fit all the requirements into the time available, only that 
        we got well behind on 4A and don't want to be there again. We figure we 
        can setup and shoot faster than we did on 4A, but we estimate at least 
        45 minutes per shot minimum (for 2 people-not including "talent"). 
        This assumes camera is loaded, and lights and sound equipment all assembled 
        and positioned. When you consider all that goes into one scene-lighting, 
        metering, focus, depth of field, camera moves, rehearsal, clothes, props, 
        sound, etc. we think even this estimate could be short. <br>
        If we have a shot that requires moving equipment to another location, 
        as many of them do, then we will need 1 person for something like 80 minutes 
        to move lights and do set ups, and the second person for maybe an hour 
        of that time. So for shooting the 4 scenes in one can, we can easily tie 
        up 2 folks for 4-5 hours. For shooting the 3 cans of IMAX we will have 
        on 5A, we are going to need some very creative thinking on how to get 
        this all done.. </font>

</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep and Sergei work 
        with the bar code reader and the IMS database for about 2 hours. We do 
        some planning as to how the Node barcoding will be done. We inventory 
        all the labels and find we have about 350 spare code labels, and figure 
        that should be enough for now. We do some practice moves and load these 
        in the BCR, and then try batch file transfers on the SSC. It works-data 
        base gets the info. There are some nuances that make it a bit tricky-we 
        had 2 instances of the BCR reader open at the same time, didn't know it, 
        and got the message that the computer could not read the BCR. Both instances 
        were fighting over the comm. port. Just another computer lesson learned. 
        Shep missing his former OS and getting a lot more PC education than he 
        ever wanted, although Sergei is an excellent teacher. <br>
        We still have got to come up with an easy way to input data for all the 
        gear and bags that are coded but are not in the data base. We have also 
        got to create codes and data entries for all the soft lockers, PMA 3, 
        Z-1, and several panels in the Node. Sergei suggests that we create some 
        kind of "pile" that we put things in for the ground to help 
        do the detailed data entries. That way, things that appear in the database 
        will have the correct attributes. We're not sure what the most efficient 
        way to do this will be. We are definitely open to any good ideas from 
        the specialists on how to facilitate this.</font>

        finally decide that some sectors on the drive must be bad. After another 
        spare drive is put in and imaged, it runs OK. The new Ghost software is 
        much more reliable than the earlier version we were using. </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We're up at 0645, 
        getting ready for what promises to be a busy day. We've been waiting for 
        word on moving the OCA back to the Service Module, where it will be much 
        more useful for us. Got the OK last night that we will do it today. Ground 
        also wants to reconfigure the SM TV system and try to send video to the 
        ground today through OCA. We are reading that message and trying to get 
        an overview of what the intended hookup is. Drawing on the last page of 
        the message is kind of simplified, but adds a lot to the big picture.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We start immediately 
        into the changes. Shep is working on pulling cables off OCA and isolating 
        the cable runs in the Node. Sergei and Yuri are behind panels aft of the 
        central post changing cable feeds for the TV system. The downlink "test" 
        of the OCA is scheduled for 4 something p.m. and it sounds like a lot 
        of time, but we are concerned we will be ready.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">OCA laptop gets shut 
        down in the Node, and is moved to its original place on the right side 
        of the central post in the SM. Looks good there, although it is right 
        next to CKB-2 which is still condensing way too much water on its piping. 
        We are going to have to fix that sometime later. </font>

</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Back into it with 
        OCA. The procedure to connect up the data line calls for us to pull out 
        2 data lines which run aft the length of the FGB to the ??? and put their 
        aft terminals next to connectors in the ?? so we can check continuity. 
        We leave cables in place and jumper the pins on each end of the cable 
        one at a time to ground and check continuity (and open circuit) that way. 
        Probably saves us 1-2 hours. Also using the scopemeter for this kind of 
        work is sort of overkill. A small test-light probe would do fine here.</font>

        time to read the steps, all 3 of us pushing keys and moving cables, etc. 
        Finally figured we had to restart to change the video settings on the

</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We have a quick huddle 
        on the work plan. Monday, per the schedule, is going to be a busy day. 
        The form 24 contains a few things we have not done before-TVIS test, CMG's, 
        and FPP activation. CMG commanding with the DAT laptop had been briefed 
        to us by the 4A crew, but we had not had the time to do anything more 
        than a quick view of the overall logic. The full procedure runs 60 pages 
        and with several messages for updates-- we are concerned that we will 
        be able to get it all done on time. We did some get-aheads Sunday night, 
        pulling the Node P1 panel off, to look at cable connections and to understand 
        whether we needed to move the SSC laptop used for the CMG controller.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">0815 Shep starts 
        the periodic fitness assessment on the TVIS, as the velo is down. Got 
        going on this early to get it out of the way before the CMG work. Test 
        takes about 40 minutes. Have to clear all the files from the "polar" 
        watch and then record and send down the data instead of downlinking it 
        through the MEC, and this adds maybe 30 minutes more. Manually switching 
        speeds on the treadmill is somewhat tricky at higher belt speeds and it 
        is recommended that we find a way to load the test as a profile in the 
        TVIS controller.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Right after the TVIS 
        test, Shep and Sergei start into the CMG procedure. We figure it would 
        be better for 2 people to be familiar with this. Sergei is doing double 
        duty, helping set up the "Chibis" and it instrumentation as 
        well as lending a hand with the CMG commanding. The procedure goes as 
        planned, and we cycle through the 4 CMG's fairly rapidly, send commands, 
        and logging the return data. Timeliners have this laid out for 3 &frac12; 
        hours total in two sessions, and counting the get-ahead time, Sergei's 
        help, and recording data, we figure this was about right. (thanks planners!)</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri and Sergei finish 
        up with the Chibis set up, and ground decides there isn't a long enough 
        pass today to get all the checkout done. It will probably be on the plan 
        for tomorrow.<br><br>
        After lunch, we do a quick tape session for a Russian kids' game-show-"???????a 
        ?? ????". Sergei sends down a short live video tour of the aft part 
        of SM. We wish we had the full "Liv" TV system onboard-it would 
        add a lot to our ability to tape and do reasonably high quality editing. 
        With our limited comm., this would really assist us in getting usable 
        material to the ground. If this stuff shows up on the next Progress or 
        Shuttle, we will definitely make use of it.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Put off the file 
        server backup scheduled for the a.m. as there is too much other stuff 
        going on. Then the OCA plan for uplink/downlink keeps shifting, and we 
        don't want the server tied up with a backup while the ground is trying 
        to access it. Will try and get this in late tonight or first thing in 
        the a.m. Tuesday.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep is in the Node, 
        switching power for the Node Comm Unit so we can take more data from the 
        probe on P6. Since the UOP panel on the Starboard side is secured while 
        we troubleshoot, the NCU gets plugged into the Port UOP. Laptop is also 
        powered off of this side. Laptop powers up and starts booting. Shep plugs 
        in the parallel line from the NCU and the UOP trips off with a fault indication. 
        Pretty much the same signature as last week when we could not figure what 
        was wrong with it. Unplugged the parallel cable, and reset the UOP. Laptop 
        (minus the cable) powered up and ran OK. FPP experiment is given the rest 
        of the day off. We're now convinced there's enough weird science between 
        the FPP and the UOP fault detection circuits to keep folks on the ground 
        busy for some time. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Finished the workday 
        with a checkout of the sound level meter. (SLM). Did the internal test, 
        unit passed with -25.8 dB (OK). Did the visual inspection and had trouble 
        identifying the "protective grid". Our meter has a smooth tip 
        which looks like a cylinder. The top surface does have some damage--about 
        a 3mm hole in it, but is otherwise smooth. No grates or slots. We talk 
        to Houston and are standing by for more words.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After dinner, Yuri 
        is trying to load up the CD world map set sent up on 4A. We apparently 
        need to load some "CPSC" software in addition to read the CD's. 
        Any help from the ground on this one would be greatly appreciated.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We're getting ready 
        for our first school radio contact tomorrow, with Burbank School in Chicago. 
        They sent us an email describing their preparations for the comm. pass, 
        and we want to share this with all the troops in the Control Centers who 
        are making "Alpha" work. If you ever had the question-"why 
        a space station?" --this is a pretty eloquent answer: <br>
        ". . . .Burbank School is a K-8 school in Burbank, a community located 
        on the southwest side of Chicago. Our school has a student population 
        of 700<br>
        students. <br>
        Since being notified of our ISS contact, our teachers and students have<br>
        been very busy with space, space station, and space exploration topics<br>
        and activities. Here are just a few things going on at our school.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Our entire school 
        population participated in a school wide art contest<br>
        involving the creation of our Burbank School/ ISS mission patch. In<br>
        addition, we held auditions for our team of 12 students with 2 back up<br>
        students. We ended up with students from a cross-section of classes. <br>
        For our questions, we again turned to our students, school wide and were 
        surprised at the quantity and quality of questions received.<br>
        If you walked into our school today and wandered down the halls, you<br>
        would be surprised at the variety of topics, activities, and displays 
        of<br>
        work all centered around the ISS mission. Our school is vibrating with<br>
        excitement and activity. <br>
        Our first graders have been creating space people and space capsules.<br>
        Their themes are "Flying High is Grade One" and "Adventures 
        in Space".<br>
        Their bulletin boards reflect the imagination and creativity only a first<br>
        grader can have. They even have Winnie the Pooh in a space suit!<br>
        As you walk past classrooms, you can hear students and teachers alike<br>
        talking about space, shuttles, space stations, and what the latest<br>
        information is about the ISS. <br>
        Second graders wrote stories about why they would like to be an<br>
        astronaut and then made shuttles out of Pringle cans. They colored<br>
        pictures of astronauts and put their own photo in the helmets. Some<br>
        built space communities of the future and created robots that will<br>
        perform city services. They even wrote laws for their community. One of<br>
        our classes created the Cosmic Cafe. Menu items include Lift-off<br>
        Lemonade, Space Station Steak, and Pluto Pudding. <br>
        Students in the middle grades were busy imagining they were astronauts<br>
        working on the space station. They wrote their own biographies and<br>
        included future missions they world like to be involved with. They<br>
        tracked the ISS on the web and plotted on a map where the space stationwas 
        every 45 minutes. They wrote time lines comparing our school day to the 
        ISS. Other children wrote poems and made chalk drawings to accompany their 
        poems. <br>
        To prepare for our ISS contact, the junior high students searched the<br>
        web for information on the space station. After much discussion, the<br>
        students created power point presentations. They made a ten-slide show, 
        which consisted of one slide telling what the ISS is, one slide for the 
        astronaut, and one for each cosmonaut on the ISS, the remaining slides 
        contained information about space and the space station. Students are 
        prepared to present this to our audience on the day of the contact. The 
        power point work was done by our Special Education students in junior 
        high. <br>
        Other junior high classes worked on creating a NASA time line. In Math,<br>
        students used the distance formula to calculate the ISS' distance from 
        us<br>
        here in Burbank. This was done over a period of several days so students 
        understood the idea that it was moving constantly. <br>
        In addition to measuring distance, students also considered time. They<br>
        thought about their own future and where they would be in the year 2030.<br>
        By then we will need a new ISS, so some of our future engineers decided 
        to design and build the space station of the year 2030. They not only 
        built the model, they also wrote a paper describing how and where it<br>
        will be built. Our more artistic students decided they would be<br>
        scientists on the new space station. They proposed that they were<br>
        assigned to gather information using a new high powered telescope. They 
        then used their creativity and imagination to draw what they saw when 
        they looked through the telescope. Some of our students are very<br>
        interested in the environment. They decided they would research and<br>
        write a paper describing a particular man-made Earth pollution problem.<br>
        They then would develop a plan for solving the problem using the<br>
        technology of the space station. <br>
        All classes spent time using many of the websites that Charlie Sufana<br>
        shared with us. As our students continued their search, one site led to<br>
        another and their enthusiasm grew proportionately. <br>
        We here at Burbank School are ready.----OVER...." <br>

        Saturday morning. Fortunately, a "rest" day. We are ready for 
        some time off. Looking for coffee. Already drank all the coffee that 4A 
        brought up, but going to order a bunch more on 5A when the lab comes. 
        We root around through the chow boxes and find some more. "Alpha"

        onboard. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spent some time organizing 
        all the message traffic. We have a regular message board-make that 2 message

        we print instead of printing new ones so we don't use more paper. If stuff 
        gets really old, it goes back through the printer. Got some words from 
        Houston how to sort and search the "messages" page, and this 
        is really useful info-Thanks!!</font>

        across both hatches when we open the valves. Gave a quick look inside 
        PMA 3-nice and dry. Hull was moderately warm to the touch-maybe 70 degrees. 
        Closed the hatch.</font>

        and most of the afternoon on it. Lots of raw material left over from stowage 
        frames on Progress. Just finding something that is suitable is most of 
        the battle. Mounted the second ??? box and otherwise made good headway 
        on the table layout. It is turning into an excellent "team" 
        project. About 1600 we stow the parts and tools and knock off for some 
        exercise.</font>

        swap an RPCM in the Node. One unit has a firmware problem-ground wants 
        to replace it. Not sure whose data is right as to where the spare is-our 
        data base does not agree with what's sent up to us. We pulled a spare 
        RPCM from a different Node stowage location and put in the Z-1 standoff 
        two days ago. Check the Node stowage labels against the message, and yes, 
        the required spare is up in the overhead. Undo the IRED, pull the support 
        braces off, and move the IRED platform down out of the way. Open the Z-1 
        hatch and pull out the RPCM. Put the IRED back in place and torque everything 
        down. Getting RPCM in hand takes about an hour. <br>
        Sergei and Shep pull off the closeout panel and access the installed RPCM. 
        Again, pictures are very useful in the procedure. RPCM changeout straightforward. 
        Talk to Moscow who relays to Houston we are go for powerup. Planned timeline 
        for this one was 40 minutes-not counting the RPCM hunt, probably needed 
        an extra 20 minutes just to clear the stowage off of the panel. </font>

        were low, and are still low today--Sergei's in the high 20's and Shep's 
        about 35 dB. Talk to the ground and we're discussing troubleshooting.

        The UOP trouble shooting will be done first. We kind of expected that 
        CMG and other activities would have to wait until we got the UOP panel 
        in a reliable configuration. Shep did the procedure sent by OCA in detail, 
        and the UOP "cured" itself. Previous dropouts did not reoccur

        cap for the line which connects station and the ODS. Asked Houston about 
        it-they said to make up a cap from something. Line is an intake to a cabin 
        fan, so the cap has to be somewhat rigid. Took out the clamp and bracket 
        kit and made a new vent cap from .030" aluminum. Shears and sheet 
        metal pliers made this a straightforward task. Put the cap on the end 
        of the duct. Loaded the PMA with gear that we don't plan on seeing again

        fitted around hatches to indicate airflow during small leaks. They look 
        like hot-wire anemometers. We are not sure how well they will work. We 
        didn't put them on the hatches aft to the Soyuz, as this is the first 
        place we will go and leak check regardless of the indicated data. Got 
        several of the sensors up and checking the wiring connections.</font>

        on the IRED calibration. We pulled a cable out a bit too far last night 
        seeing what exercises we could do with IRED, and one canister is now making 
        some "clicking" sound. We pull the canister up and open the 
        bottom up, and the thimble on the end of the lanyard is a bit out of position. 
        Believe it's rubbing the cover so we reset it and put the canister back. 
        Works smoothly. got the calibration going but could not finish it with 
        the troubleshooting for UOP's going on. Will complete this tomorrow. So 
        far, the calibration looks pretty linear, except that one can is about 
        10% stronger than the other. We plan on just putting up a strip of tape

        inside, but we need some expert help to try and resolve. Will wait to

        Brent and crew come into view and we do the arrival honors. It does feel 
        a lot more like a ceremony than the handshake across the hatch. We're 
        glad we got to do it. A few minutes of saying hello on the quarterdeck, 
        and then it's off to Endeavour to see the arrays. Going back through the 
        hatches-we have the sensation of being in a smaller and more cramped environment. 
        Station is getting spacious with the long hatchway fore and aft, and pretty 
        big volume in the Node. It's a real contrast. We check out the arrays-they 
        look too frail to be so large-but they're working. Also surprised at how 
        close the orbiter is to the PMA-we are right on top of it out the AFD

</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep on TVIS for 
        the test. Tried all the pc flash cards in the MEC before the data take 
        to see which ones were useable. MEC could not read any of them and 2 of 
        the cards crashed the computer. Same symptoms as before. Ran the TVIS 
        schedule with pc cards anyway. (FE-1 for Shep. Sergei ran later with "spare" 
        card). Noticed that the static buildup discharges when you touch the control 
        panel and blanks the screen display. Happened twice. Also disabled the 
        keyboard entry. But treadmill kept on running. Max speed on the treadmill 
        was 14 km/hr. Video documentation to be shipped down on 4A. Sergei does 
        the same test in the afternoon.</font>

        about the logistics plan for 4A gear transfer. We received OCA 431 and 
        this very helpful in figuring out what we need to do. It's a much more 
        integrated plan than the bits and pieces we were working off of earlier. 
        (ought to put this one in the CAPCOM notebook as a model of how to do 
        it.) </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mid afternoon, Sergei 
        and Shep spend well over an hour going over the ingress and patch panel 
        details. We find the EPS training drawings to be extraordinarily useful. 
        (Thanks, Bart and Lee). The before and after patch panel config is clearly 
        laid out and although the procedure is 29 pages long, we think we know 
        what our part is about. We are hunting down tools and ziplock bags, tape, 
        connector pliers. Ready to go maybe 1 &frac12; hours early, which is good 
        because Houston calls and says to get on with it. So Sergei starts to 
        equalize the pressure on the KBD valve, and we're in the PMA and Node 
        in about 5 minutes. Port panel over the patch panel is already off and 
        stowed. We take out the deck panel-this is a 60 second job for the Makita. 
        Check the connectors against the procedure and we're ready.<br>
        Back to the central post to standby for a go.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The EVA'ers are rolling 
        and we are trying to stay ahead of the timeline. Houston calls the RACU 
        power off and Sergei and Shep back inside the Node to do the connector 
        swap. Night ops-all the Node lighting powered down. Shep's reading and 
        holding the light--Sergei's doing. Very quick work and we're back out 
        to wait for the next panel. We standby the central post as Houston goes 
        through the rest of the reconfig.. Finally get the call that we're ready-- 
        the second RACU is powered down. We're just finishing up the laptop bus 
        swap, and Endeavor's already on the loop saying that Carlos and Joe have 
        their side done. We are thinking those guys must have had their connectors 
        already half threaded-we are sandbagged. We get in the Node and finish 
        the deck panel. We put up the covers, check the drying fans and depart. 
        Houston's pressing on and the rest of the procedure is configuration clean 
        up. Node running on P6 power.</font>

        about the plan for Wednesday-still under discussion. Specialists want 
        us to do CKB airconditioner installation. We don't know how time critical 
        this is, but we have a lot on our plate to be ready for Friday-and we 
        need some time to get our gear organized. Talk to Houston some more and 
        standing by to see the plan in the a.m.</font>

        virtually simo. This worked out OK in this instance, but we really need 
        to watch this-has the potential, with every good intent, to do something 
        bad. Sergei and Shep getting the big picture and sorting out what we are 
        doing-need maybe 20-30 minutes just to feel like we know what everyone's 
        doing. We ask if there is a time crunch to get ingress started on time. 
        Houston says no, so we take a couple more moments making sure that we

        Takes a lot longer to settle out than we expected. Maybe 20 minutes or 
        more. Houston has the IMV open so Node and PMA end up at the same pressure. 
        Sergei opens the APAS hatch, goes into the PMA and opens the Node hatch. 
        Lights are on. Node is spacious. A little cool, but not uncomfortable. 
        Shep in shorts and a long shirt and feels OK. Node seems very dry. Hardly 
        any velcro anywhere-we need to put some down when we get in on a permanent 
        basis. Kind of swimming around, as we are used to much tighter quarters

        for the 3rd time this flight. We close the PMA 3 hatch and the equalization 
        valve. Shep in the Node pulling out other IMAX bags we need. Yuri finishes 
        putting in the portable fans. We can't find the new dessicant bags and 
        procedure is kind of convoluted about this. Decide to get out of the Node, 
        close the ?? hatch and talk to Houston. Houston points us to the right 
        location-we're back in and bags are there in a pile of plastic wrappers. 
        We do a quick bag swap. New dessicant bags are wrapped like they are going 
        to Mars and back. Plastic bags over the dessicant are tough to get off. 
        SEAL knives are out. Bags are on the fans and we're out of the Node-just

        and new tool bits for the power tools. Plus all the other stuff on our

        tighten the SPD arms on the TVIS treadmill. Knobs keep backing off, and 
        the vise grips are used to put some more torque on them. <br>
        Got a 20 min. run in at moderate speed. Did have an interesting anomaly 
        with the control display. Treadmill was cranking away at 7 km/hr and somehow 
        the screen displays went blank on the control panel. Keypad was unresponsive. 
        "system pause" would not work either. Treadmill is running as 
        before. Tried the "emergency stop" magnet and that was functional. 
        Stopped the treadmill, powered down, started up, and finished the session

        First time we have seen the tail forward maneuver. Orbiter looks like

        calls exchanged. "Romeo at the dip." ( translation: receiving 
        ship is ready for maneuvering ship to begin approach. ) Endeavor asks 
        about solar array position, but we can't verify without RS laptop. We 
        ask Endeavour to check with Houston. <br>
        Calls from Endeavour close in are very helpful to alert us to initial

        at the ???? control panel ready to intervene. The release is smooth and 
        straight away. "Progress, . . . departing"</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei is shooting 
        out the large nadir window with the laser rangefinder. Progress does a 
        backoff pulse and flies below us, going slightly behind. As Progress gets 
        lower it comes into the sunlight and and crosses underneath to the port 
        side aft, well away from station.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After the undock, 
        Shep hooks up the 4A PCS to the central post. Unfortunately, can't find 
        the means to power up the PCS socket for GNC 1 bus. GNC 2 is easy, as 
        that has a tumbler switch on the ??? panel. Talk to ??? about this one, 
        and ask if we have a drawing onboard which might show what powers these 
        sockets. (Don't think we do.) More on this one tomorrow. For right now, 
        4A PCS is on GNC-2.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We finish up having 
        a look over the form 24 for docking day with Endeavour, We decide we have 
        had a pretty good day, having used all the power tools, hammer, files, 
        1/2 of the other hand tools, COSS reference library, and schematic drawings 
        all in the same day.</font>
