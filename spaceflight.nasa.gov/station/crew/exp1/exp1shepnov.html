        Woke up to the good news that maybe we would not have to wrestle with 
        the IMS switchover until after the 4A mission. All onboard agree with 
        the plan to keep things as they are for now. Really no big hit to us--we 
        are logging things by hand and can continue to do this for the 4A gear 
        transfers.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">More good news--early

        that we can only send down 5 'middeck locker-equivalents", Shep is 
        in Progress stowing CTB's which can not be accommodated in the Shuttle 
        for return. Discussions with Houston about stowage, gear return, CTB's

</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep gets later word

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We take on a bunch 
        of O2 from Progress on the station--gauge says 785 mm (over C&amp;W limit) 
        for cabin pressure, and ground says PPO2 is now 190mm. Yuri and Sergei 
        close the hatch. Ground runs a pressure check--SM hatch is OK, ground 
        says Progress is also OK. We are wondering if we will see the inside of 
        this Progress again. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri does his EVA 
        check on the velo with instrumentation. Shep on the TVIS. We are appreciating 
        the 2-a-day workout plan. Sometimes we have to bend the workout times, 
        but at least everyone is getting at the bike and the treadmill for 2 sessions 
        each day.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep putting together 
        the changes to the Joint Ops book for 4A. Big thanks to the planners for 
        carving out some time to do this. It's the little things that really slow

        Also made a request for a "volume" estimate of how many CTB 
        equivalents 4A can take home. We are going to take all foam out of the 
        CTB's we want to return and put this material in Progress. Still will 
        be the case that CTB's will likely have to be discarded because we have 
        too much volume to give Shuttle. We are thinking to send as much on Shuttle 
        as possible so that if we get Progress back, we can have max. stowage 
        volume for the 4A-5A period. Logs planning needs to help us stay ahead

        to 2 CWC's, and about 6 flat metal food containers will be sent down. 
        Other things we plan on returning include--film, video cassettes, air 
        sample bottles, FMK samples, TVIS pc cards (that we can't get to work). 
        This all will fit in a "double" CTB. We need ground's OK and

        line per procedure about 4-5 more times and stopped. Talked to ??? and 
        Houston regarding the details. TEPC powered off and located on SM 428.

        Hopefully, this will be an acceptable survey location for the next period

        we can conveniently put TEPC, as many of the CHECS ports are being used

        the heat exchanger started operating. We heard vibrations and metallic 
        sounds, and then smelled a bit of hot insulation. Ground called that the 
        fan was off. Visual inspection revealed at least one blade sheared off 
        the fan (small axial vanes) and jammed up in the blade housing. Will have 
        to wait until we can take this apart to see more details. We're guessing 
        that something hard went through the blades, but we will have to see the 
        whole unit. The good news is that we show a spare blower onboard, so we 
        have another chance to go fix something. </font>

        We're up--first comm with TsUP at 0614. Breakfast in the "wardroom"--on 
        our mess table. The crew "turned to" over the weekend and we 
        have a prototype table set up with brackets and clamps to evaluate size 
        and location. All hands agree that the standard table (still on the ground) 
        will not be very serviceable, as it will block access to the SRVK, and 
        will be in the way of the treadmill and the doorway of the starboard cayuta. 
        Our do-it-yourself model is somewhat narrower, shorter and lower. We think 
        our prototype will fit better, and we feel pretty happy that we can leave 
        the other table on the ground. Power tools are out and development activity

        machine had been swapped out. Voice quality much better, even video looked

        capability to drag OCA into SM). Having the OCA right at the central post 
        is most convenient. We can hear the call connect "ring" anywhere 
        in the SM, and this is a big advantage for us. Our ability to pay attention 
        to the OCA will be significantly reduced once the machine is back in FGB 
        or in the Node. </font>

        will take 2 full days to finish the unload and get stowage somewhat in 
        order. Then we will still have to gather up what goes back into Progress, 
        when, and in what order. Plus the transfer items for 4A. We try to give 
        the planners our sense of how it's going and estimates of time required.</font>

        0900 Crew is up. OCA must have worked overnight, as we have files onboard. 
        Thinking about what to do with all the Progress gear. Reviewing where 
        we got to on Saturday--</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On Sat. we got up 
        late afternoon, strapped on the power tools and spare batteries, and "locked 
        and loaded" with the 12mm sockets. Sergei led the way into the top 
        of the Progress. Sergei said the nose of the docking probe "smells 
        like space". It did have kind of a burnt toast odor to it--very faint. 
        Sergei coached Shep to start the unload. Shep started "power tooling", 
        taking fasteners off. Job #1 was to clear out something so the hatch could 
        swing full open. Got down under the docking gear and got Chibis loose, 
        but this was too bulky to get around the hatch so we put it back. Then 
        took the EDV package apart in its frame and started passing EDV's out 
        piece by piece. This works. And soon there is enough room to swing the 
        hatch open and start moving serious equipment. We find the documentation 
        package, and the cargo diagrams in a white bag. Shep is thinking "how 
        did these guys ever get this thing loaded?" All the EDV's, KTO's, 
        out. Pump packages and spares come out. BKO's for SRVK out. Everything 
        strapped to the deck in FGB. First layer of gear in Progress is cleared 
        out, but now we have the large "containers" each with a pile 
        of stuff about 2m deep to deal with. At least we can get at the top of 
        it. <br>
        Sergei and Yuri work on putting a pump in the SOTR system rack, just to 
        get it out of the way. We take a break about 2130 for some chow, and to 
        go through the care packages that we found on Progress. The troops are 
        pretty happy that we have all our "loot", and the mail from 
        home is great. Sergei got some excellent kielbassa--we test this right 
        away. Cranked up the laptop and we watch disk 1 of "Sixth Sense". 
        We call it a night at about midnight.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1100 Back to Sunday--Discussion 
        with TsUP. We are kind of interested to know if the work/wardroom table 
        was flown up on the Progress. Does not look like it's onboard. TsUP says 
        they think it's still on the ground. Not a big problem--we were debating 
        for a long time prelaunch whether we had room for all 3 sections anyway. 
        We asked that at least one of the fold out parts not fly to give us more 
        room in the aft part of SM. So now we're thinking how to make something 
        up which will serve in the interim. We joke with TsUP about sending up 
        some plans so we can make a table on orbit. Lots of possibilities in Progress--brackets 
        and frame material everywhere. <br>
        Sergei and Yuri are working on the plan to unload Progress--approach is 
        methodical chaos--attack fasteners, unpack a bit, stow a bit. Seems like 
        a good plan. Shep is worried that we will never figure out how to put 
        it all back together and close the hatch, but Sergei says no problem. 
        </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Talk with Houston 
        on VHF. We discuss OCA issues. Reboot and diagnostic test proceed without 
        problems. We're thinking about how we are transitioning from mail which 
        was on an OCA file, and then on the SSC server, and now moving to the 
        "outlook" world. We don't think we completely understand what 
        the SSC file server and the individual client machines are doing with 
        respect to each other, handling the outlook files. How we stay sync'd 
        up is the issue. This would probably be transparent to us if the comm 
        link was better, but we are concerned about losing things if they don't 
        happen to get put in the right place onboard. </font>

        to Shuttle, Progress can maneuver pretty quickly. Progress stationkeeps 
        directly under us, and then Yuri drives it in slowly for the docking. 
        TV picture is not as defined as we were expecting, and picking up the 
        docking target is quite challenging. Yuri has it lined up inside of about

        was minus 7.18 dB. Turned it on anyway and waved the meter around a bit 
        in FGB and SM. Frequency spectrum response looked reasonable and obtained 
        readings in the 62-65 dB range, but don't know what these numbers mean

        to the BCR. We think the problem may be with SSC configuration but SSC 
        3 was imaged at activation along with the other SSC's. Com ports are available 
        on other machines and we do not understand this difference. Will reimage

        keep the flow of work moving, but we just have not been able to talk enough. 
        We are probably keeping the planners busy as they reschedule what we did'nt 
        finish. We will try to make things work as smoothly as we can.</font>

        We all spend the remainder of the working day just putting things away

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">830-920 Shep had 
        first exercise period on the velo-ergometer. Very nice set-up as far as 
        stowage and deployment. Felt that the hand/upper body workout was awkward 
        as far as adjusting the load settings. Basically you have to pedal the 
        "generator" with one hand and punch buttons with the other. 
        Velo-ergometer kept starting at max load (250 watts) and adjusting settings 
        with this initial load was very difficult.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Velo-ergometer had 
        a tight fit between one of its support struts and a padeye on the SM deck. 
        We smoothed the fit up with a large flat file. Sergei had the vacuum cleaner 
        at the ready, but we tried the "Don Pettit" gel method to control 
        the filings. We applied a small amount of aloe gel (clear) to the fitting 
        and filed on it for 10 minutes or so. Cleaned up with a napkin. No loose 
        chips, dust or other debris.</font>

        which grew stronger as we approached. Aurora filled our viewfield from 
        SM nadir ports as we flew through it. A faint reddish plasma layer was 
        above the green field and topped out higher than our orbital altitude.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We have been receiving 
        intermittent caution messages on the SM power system--once or twice a 
        day. All indications from the laptop are normal. We believe these are 
        transient data problems as the telemetry system switches formats. No action 
        taken. Relative incidence of alarms in general for SM (and FGB-Node) is 
        surprisingly low. Whatever you ground guys are doing here, let's keep 
        it up!</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei and Yuri continue 
        to work on the FGB cable connections. Shep is helping out with wiring 
        runs and connector hookups in the GA. Finding the written instructions 
        on cable and connectors very elaborate. This is the sort of thing where 
        a good sketch would greatly help. Some of the English translation misses 
        a bit of the Russian nuance. Russian instruction says look "in the 
        vicinity of hermetic plate" and the English translation was "look 
        on the plate". The connector Shep needs is, in fact on a wire bundle 
        "in the vicinity" of the plate. (lose about 30 minutes sorting 
        this one out). Total work on the job s about 9 man hours. We finish at 
        about 1630.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei is preparing 
        to run on TVIS but we keep getting gyro fault indications. E run the malfunction 
        procedure in the MedOps book and TVIS is back on line. We think our startup 
        sequence was incorrect. Shep runs on TVIS at fairly high SLD load. Performance 
        of the TVIS is OK. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We were configuring 
        SSC 2 to run a CD when it decided to lock up. After repeated attempts 
        to restart, Shep and Sergei went through a long attempt to extract files 
        from the SSC's hard drive before reloading the SSC software. Used the 
        startup disk in the onboard software suite, but could not find a particular 
        file while hunting around with DOS. This would have been much easier with 
        some bootable media (CD-ROM?) that could run Windows. (Or if Shep was 
        not indoctrinated by that "other" operating system). We may 
        need an emergency boot capability again. After 5+ attempts, finally got 
        the hard drive to take an image off the ghost CD. One of the Autoloader 
        floppies went down, but SSC 2 is now running normally. ( 3+ hours troubleshooting).

        devices so they can run on the LAN.</font>

        Found the TVIS flash cards in AMP Pack. Thanks for the heads up on this 
        one. Would not have located those till EOM on my own.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ground started SRVK 
        operations 0830 or so, pumping condensate from the airconditioner to the 
        purification unit. About 0910 Sergei noticed a major water bubble on the 
        condensate separator in the SRVK unit. Apparently the pump which pulls 
        from the separator into the rest of the system had not been turned on, 
        so everything started backing up and eventually went out the air outlet 
        from the separator. About 500 ml of condensate on the exterior of the 
        pump package. No apparent problems, but this could have been a bigger 
        issue if the water had gotten into a bank of power distribution boxes 
        right behind the pump. We got our water cleanup quals renewed.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Used the first "D" 
        size drawing to troubleshoot the SRVK at 0915. They were very helpful. 
        Please tell the RTII's and the drawing crew that they did good work!! 
        Being able to integrate the functional schematic with the panel logic 
        was very efficient. We think the Ground configured system out of order 
        or did not enable some part of an algorithm and NOK pumped a bunch of 
        condensate into separator block 1. It is squared away now and seems to 
        be operating normally. I was going to make some comment to ground that 
        "unauthorized water pumping is not allowed aboard ship" but 
        I did not get it in on the VHF comm loops.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spent some more time 
        on insulating the CKB airconditioning compressor. The relative humidity 
        is up and it was still causing some condensation because of cold flow 
        from the freon lines. We have the thing pretty well wrapped at this point 
        and the condensation is just a few drops here and there where it was 100 
        ml. blobs before. This should also make the RH go down a bit. Bill for 
        technical work to be sent to Energia.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1500 Found the TEPC 
        and gear and set it up in SM on panel 110, right at the Central Post fwd 
        of VShVT. Spent over an hour on just the rigging alone-but it is in a 
        place where it can live undisturbed for a long while. Could not locate 
        the RS 232 cable which was supposed to be in the kit. Will check the MEC 
        bag to see if it is in there, but if any of the stowage folks know that 
        it has been relocated there this might shorten any search. TEPC has been 
        firing off intermittently, and we are watching the numbers.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We set up ham radio 
        on 4th plane of FGB just forward of PXO. Have not configured the antenna 
        lead yet, but this will be completed Fri. We do have a question as to 
        which computer is supposed to support packet radio? Is it acceptable to 
        use an SSC to do this?</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
        With regard to SSC config, Did a quick continuity check with the grounding 
        leads for the power cables attached to FGB 227, feeding the SSC router 
        and file server in the FGB. Ground to the FGB structure is electrically 
        good. Will change the ground configuration to float with the outlet socket 
        when we get time to do this-probably tomorrow a.m. </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
        Sergei did additional troubleshooting on the Wiener network. Sergei and 
        Yuri successfully connected the Wiener directly to the SSC router and 
        file server bypassing the twisted pair and it pinged OK. So the problem 
        is somewhere in the twisted pair connection. Sergei and Yuri traced down 
        the whole wire run and could not determine any fault inside the pressurized 
        volumes of SM and FGB (this took 3 hrs.) We need a wiring diagram sufficient 
        to do an electrical test if we want to proceed. Also consider we have 
        scopemeter and logic analyzer/labview onboard. However, our recommendation 
        is to forget the twisted pair for now and put the Wiener directly on the 
        FGB subnet. Router can become a spare. We can reconfigure later if desired 
        and troubleshoot the twisted pair wiring at our leisure.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We are out of laptop 
        desks for the SSC's and Wiener. We have 3 and they are all deployed. (Just 
        for background we have 9 laptops deployed and 1 or 2 more that we might 
        want to use.) 2 more desks with bracket hardware would be handy. Until 
        then, we are in a "make our own" mode, and intend to fabricate 
        a substitute desk out of structural discards from Progress or a food container 
        lid. Size of this is just about perfect. Availability of the "Panavise" 
        would be helpful for this activity. Asked TsUP where this was, got some 
        info, and looked in FGB 302, 306, 230,229, no joy. Can we please confirm 
        that this has or has not been been flown? </font>
