</p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Up at 
        midnight. We're still trying to figure out what day it is. Docking yesterday 
        went well, even with the station's configuration delays. Got some IMAX 
        shots in during approach. Comm could have been better--we are still learning 
        things about the system and how best to configure it based on what we 
        are doing. A few of the areas we need work on are the setups for VHF comm. 
        to Shuttle from the Lab, and the duration we can operate with the transmitters 
        for lines 1 and 2 turned on in the SM. <br><br>
        Cargo transfer was going well yesterday, until we hit a snag finding EVA 
        connectors to pass to the shuttle EVA'ers. We knew where all the bags 
        we received from 5A were, but we couldn't identify how these connectors 
        were "contained". The IMS data on these items did not give any detail 
        except "crewlock bag". We asked the ground for help, and got enough information 
        to start narrowing down which bag we were looking for. We finally located 
        the special EVA bag (unmarked) with the connectors inside.</font>
</p>
      <p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br><b>[REDACTED MATERIAL - 24 lines]</b></font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep starts the lab 
        IMV valve installation, with Yuri and Sergei helping with IMS searches 
        and chasing parts and tools. We look for, but can't find the IMV valves, 
        which are not in the right bag. The label on the bag says "IMV valves" 
        but they're not in there. (Besides the labeling problems, we are still 
        receiving bags which are not properly id'd in the database-no bar code 
        or bag description.)<br>
        Access to the port and starboard NPRV's is hampered by 2 large panels 
        that won't come off. We remove pieces of seat track, and that helps somewhat, 
        but the port panel (P1-01) is still mechanically hung up. In order to 
        get more clearance, we query the ground and ask to detach the portside 
        hatch track. We get the OK, and can't get the ground strap coupling to 
        "uncouple". So we take out the TORK fastener which is holding 
        the end of the strap to the hatch track frame. After freeing up the hatch 
        track, we can see a bit behind the panel, and one of the Dzus fasteners 
        is hung up in its sleeve. It is unhooked from its wire bail, but the small 
        circular clip which keeps it captive is jamming in the panel hole. So 
        we go for the hammer and drive it out. (not everybody gets to hammer on 
        $1.4B of hardware). This has happened now on 3 of the lab Dzus fittings, 
        and a long term solution for this should definitely be pursued. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei's got the 
        IMAX ready for our last 30 seconds of exterior film. We're trying to get 
        a handle on the best time to be ready for Jim and Susan's walk. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We finally make some 
        headway with the IMV valves-but the ductwork does not agree with what 
        is illustrated in the assembly ops book. More comm. with Houston about 
        part numbers. It seems we have a drawing out of config and the correct 
        parts are onboard. The next task is to seat the IMV manual handles-but 
        they are real tool challenges. Tightening the allen screws is physically 
        "not possible" with the tools called out in the procedure, due 
        to interference with the valve body. We snag a 5/16" ball-tip hex 
        driver we got from Atlantis's toolbag and that's the only way the IMV 
        valves went "in" today. We button up the surviving fasteners 
        and clean up the forward lab endcone. Total time for the procedure-7 hours. 
        Scheduled-2. (Thank you sir, may we please have another?)</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei is also inputting 
        new parameters for Plasma Crystal. The experiment is going great from 
        our end. We are definitely seeing some unexpected results and the science 
        team in Moscow is really excited. We are very happy that some serious 
        science is going down to the ground. Sergei cranks up the experiment for 
        about a 2 hour session in the morning.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep is in the lab 
        putting up the ZSR's. Now we have some time to read the directions, and 
        of course, the 2 we put up right away when 5A was in town were not quite 
        right. (Marsha was not around to supervise.) So we have to wrestle with 
        all the loose gear in the P1 bay and fix the "shield" in P2 
        ZSR. Ground checks with the ZSR control officer and we're not supposed 
        to put up Overhead 3 in the lab-special request from Exp. 2. We're wondering 
        if they did manage to manifest the sauna.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei gets some 
        exercise on TVIS. The treadmill is still hanging in there. We do the weekly 
        checks-no changes to the hardware except slight chafing on a few of the 
        bungee sheaths rigged as stabilizers. Nothing serious. Electric box temp 
        is 87.6 and motor temp is 89.5.</font>

        word that they're changing the form 24 for tomorrow. It seems the second 
        airconditioning unit-??? 2 has shut itself down. Low oil pressure in the 
        compressor. They want the power supply for No. 1 put in. We are asking 
        Moscow lots of questions-like "where" the oil is going. Apparently 
        ground telemetry indicated this was developing for a while. We ask why 
        no words were ever mentioned in the 8 O'Clock reports on this. We had 
        a lot of work and testing with the airconditioning units with 4A docked 
        and it really torpedoed our timeline. We don't want to enter into more 
        of this lightly. We ask what is moved off the timeline tomorrow to make 
        room for the 4-5 hours of IFM work on the power supply-but we don't get 
        a clear answer on that one.</font>

        working late last night with the PCS configuration "patches", 
        and wrestling with the UNIX commands. Laptops were reloaded and left shut 
        down while other files were uploaded to the MDM's. The word from Houston 
        this a.m. is to wait another rev to connect the first laptop so that we're 
        sure the changes to the C&amp;C computers are complete. </font>

        emails in his outlook "Send" folder. He drafted these up last 
        night, and they were left in his Outbox. They should be showing in his 
        "Send" folder, but they're not there, and Outbox is empty. We 
        think an old mail (ost) file was uplinked and overwrote what Yuri did. 
        We call Houston to see if the outgoing files can be recovered. Houston 
        puts this in work.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei and Yuri start 
        the morning organizing the page changes for the Russian data file. This 
        is scheduled for an hour, but takes closer to 3. The Russian books desperately 
        need markings on their binders so you can tell which book is which when 
        they are stacked up.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei and Yuri are 
        working "Plasma Crystal" in parallel all a.m. The telescience 
        terminal is set up aft of the Central Post, stbd side. It is flat on the 
        bulkhead, keyboard and screen facing forward. It's a big piece of equipment 
        and it seems an awkward orientation, but it's a compromise. At least the 
        PAO pictures will be interesting. Our ability to properly locate the computer 
        and chassis has been severely restricted by the short power cord. We don't 
        have any other choices here. Sergei and Yuri work a vacuum valve set-up 
        problem for a while and finally get the internal chamber to go to complete 
        vacuum. We get a few words in with some of the science team in Moscow. 
        Data takes start tomorrow, and we should be sending some images down of 
        what is going on.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep starts the day 
        with a review of the 5A.1 mission plan. After a "go" from Houston, 
        we finish the PCS display checkouts and load the new software on the 2nd 
        PCS in the SM. Backup PCS machines 6023 and 6024 are also loaded with 
        the 5A.060.P1 software. The keyboard work goes much more smoothly than 
        last night, but we still think most of this work could be done with the 
        File Manager application available on the Sun OS.</font>

        screws on the front stabilizer boxes were tightened today as requested. 
        Scraping on the fwd IRED canister is about the same-intermittent and at 
        all load settings. We are thinking there is something inside the canister 
        which is shifting around. The resistance for the can is somewhat decreased, 
        especially in its lower ranges. The IRED is still functioning and we want 
        to keep using it.</font>

        this stuff, as you have to think for a while where gear needs to be and 
        sometimes this is the most time-consuming part. We used the radio LAN 
        for a while to carry the whole network but it is just too slow. It will 
        not support adequate data transfers for IMS or other large files like

        even be down in the Soyuz with your laptop and still stay on line. Putting

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">0030 We are getting 
        up and moving about after a short night. Yuri's bunked on the SM port 
        bulkhead in the small diameter of the module. We have the hatch to the 
        ??? closed so the living volume is the smallest we have had to put up 
        with since we docked the Soyuz. We made a request to leave the ??? hatch 
        open, as we had configured a number of things in there for "plasma 
        crystal" which need to be changed back, but ??? turned us down. We 
        moved the file server back into the FGB so we can get at messages, world 
        map, etc. Mail has been cut off for a while as the OCA machine has been 
        unhooked and put in the FGB. Anyway, going through the vehicle and closing 
        all the hatches was a good exercise in how we might deal with a slow cabin 
        leak situation, where we want to avoid damaging wire runs, etc. and we 
        have an hour or so to close things up. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We start into the 
        systems on SM, shutting everything off. This goes quickly, as Sergei and 
        Yuri have done this lots before on Mir. We save ??? for last, and we'll 
        probably turn that on first when we get back aboard. We set up the comm., 
        although we are not completely certain that the configuration is going 
        to perform based on the testing the last two days. We put some chow and 
        the DVD player in the Soyuz and close the hatch about 0530.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It takes 2 orbits 
        to get the first set of hooks off and the docking tunnel pressure checked. 
        We get the "Austin Powers" sequel in while all this is taking 
        place. (Maybe a Soyuz first here). We are down in the ?????????? ??????? 
        and Shep has definitely forgotten how small the couches are. We finally 
        are ready to do the second set of hooks and undock just after 1000. Comm 
        is through Sband link now and we aren't getting voice up from Moscow. 
        Yuri broadcasts in the blind anyway. We come off the docking adapter pretty 
        briskly, and we are moving straight aft. It's kind of surprising how little 
        rotation we have picked up in the separation. We drift out to 30 meters 
        or so and Yuri starts flying manually. We have a timeline where ??? wants 
        us to be based on comm. coverage and lighting, but we are not real happy 
        that there seems to be no real loss of comm. plan once we are off. We 
        had asked about this, but were told that we should just "sit tight" 
        till we come back into radio contact. We pick up Moscow the radio. Yuri 
        does his usual great job flying us around and we make a short trip up 
        the underside of the station. Visibility, lighting, target contrast are 
        all OK. Then we get to hang out for the final approach. Moscow gives the 
        go, and we are moving in. About 3 meters out, we get a "wait" 
        call as the TV picture on the ground is suddenly bad. Nobody's very happy 
        about this-it's a bad place for a "wait-out". Fortunately, Moscow 
        comes back quickly and gives us a go. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We make contact-it's 
        a moderate bump with the docking mechanism. Then the docking program starts 
        working to tighten everything up. Then a second set of hooks from FGB, 
        and pressure checks. More DVD. We have a good seal, and we equalize the 
        docking tunnel, and then to the station. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1320 We're opening 
        up the FGB nadir hatch, and we start equalizing and opening the other 
        hatches onboard. Sergei queries the ground about the FGB- ??? equalization 
        valve, and we get the word that it's open. Sergei cracks the hatch and 
        it pops off and cruises into the compartment pretty smartly. (it weighs 
        maybe 60 kilos). Ears are popping and dust is flying. We guess we had 
        a few extra mm. in the Soyuz. The lab software is not happy and we get 
        Dp/Dt messages, along with some other warnings that appear unrelated. 
        </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We're back inside 
        the station and it does seem good to get back "home". Everything 
        is as we left it, and now we get to turn everything back on again, and 
        re-rig all the hatches and cabling. The station air temperature has dropped 
        maybe 5-8 degrees F, and is noticeably cool. We figure this is what happens 
        when you turn all the electrical loads off. Powering everything back up 
        takes the rest of the afternoon, and by early p.m., we are all ready to 
        call it a day.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">25 FEB</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sunday. Sergei and 
        Yuri are getting ready for TORU refresher training. Shep is in the lab 
        working on the rest of the SSC reconfiguration. We get the server moved 
        back to the lab, and the RF access points set up and talking. Just as 
        a test, we take a laptop into the SM and it is still staying on the radio 
        network. It is talking to the access point in the Node through all the 
        hatchways. Radio LAN speed is pretty slow, though. The mobile laptop is 
        reading about 15K bits/sec, which is way under what we have on the Ethernet. 
        Other SSC's on the net (fixed) are reading 30K over the radio LAN "bridge". 
        We plan on making a comprehensive test of the network speed soon.<br><br>
        We have the afternoon set aside for TVIS repair. We had tried to change 
        out 2 broken slats last week, but we were not happy with the belt configuration 
        and how it ran. Ground uplinked an additional procedure which requires 
        pulling the TVIS out of its pit and freeing up the belt to work on its 
        underside. We start into this and the work goes fairly smoothly. We pull 
        the treadmill out and loosen the belt tensioners. After moving the belt 
        around a bit, we recover the one lost rivnut. It is "swaged" 
        on the top, with part of the screw broken off inside of it. At first, 
        we don't understand why this happened, but this becomes clear after we 
        notice that the washers on the treadmill slats have interior holes with 
        2 slightly different sizes. We did not have any heads up on this. The 
        small washers definitely hang up on the shaft of the rivnut. (picture 
        of this sent down in the Checs folder Mon. night). <br>
        We straighten out the other bent rivnuts and assemble everything per procedure. 
        We have some clean up steps to perform but we decide these can wait till 
        Monday. We knock off at about 1900 to eat and enjoy the rest of the weekend, 
        although the planners have promised us a light Monday and Tues. (We'll 
        see). </font>

        The day really gets off to a bad start. The server connection to the net 
        is down hard. We worked on it last night until 0100 and could not bring 
        it up. We were doing the file server part of network reconfiguration yesterday. 
        This moved the FS to the lab-we also extended the Ethernet lan from the 
        Node into the lab (not part of the procedure). This allowed the server 
        to rejoin the network without delay, rather than waiting much later when 
        the RF access points are set up. The plan was working well, and the server 
        was online from mid afternoon. At about 2200, we were reconfiguring some 
        mail files which, with a lot of help from Windows NT, got put in the wrong 
        place during the backup procedure. When we finished restoring the files, 
        the network was down and would not come back up. We worked this for several 
        hours. Finally, jiggling some cables brings just a part of the net back. 
        (that really instills confidence in the stability of your network).</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So as of 0700, we 
        have to use the OCA machine for daily planning. Fortunately, ground has 
        uplinked everything to the OCA's directories, so at least we have what 
        we need onboard. But when we try and print, the printer locks up. It is 
        not happy with the net now either. So Shep and Sergei start trying to 
        figure out what is going on. After trying lots of other computer tricks 
        that don't work, we put another network card in the server and that seems 
        to fix the server problem. We power cycle the printer and that comes back. 
        We are having a hard time understanding the how and why, but everything 
        is working.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri and Sergei are 
        configuring for the Soyuz comm. checks, with Sband patched in. We have 
        minimally readable comm., with some echo. We are getting good reception 
        with Sband patched into the Russian intercom system, but apparently Houston 
        is still reading us with lots of echo. We have occasionally had other 
        loops up which might be producing this problem, but there are other instances 
        where our comm. config has been completely by the book and we still have 
        problems. ( hey-we are writing the book!)</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep does the checks 
        in the lab for NH3 in the fluid loops. Readings are essentially unchanged 
        from a week ago--nominal. The ammonia sample bag is still a mess to deal 
        with-there is just no way to do this without loose fluid drops.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep gets on the 
        TVIS to see how bad the loose slat is that Sergei noticed last night. 
        We had put in 2 new slats and torqued them down hard. One of the screws 
        from the replacement slat is gone, and Shep puts a new screw in the hole 
        and it just turns. Looking more closely, the rivnut which catches the 
        screw is completely out of the belt. We take off the back cover for the 
        TVIS and turn the belt by hand. Everything seems useable. Shep turns the 
        treadmill on, and walks unpowered. Belt is still OK. With moderate speed, 
        the belt is still happy, but we have a clicking noise on the forward belt 
        cover. On closer inspection, we have another tread which is bowed up and 
        is hitting the cover as it passes under. We think this tread may be cracked 
        on the underside, and is flexing more than anticipated. We talk to Houston 
        about taking off the front cover as well.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Right after lunch, 
        we tag up with Exp-2 on the OCA. Comm is minimally adequate-we can get 
        the main points across if everyone speaks slowly. We try and warn out 
        the next crew that we think the docked period will be very busy, based 
        on our 4A and 5A experiences. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri and Sergei are 
        going over the undocking details. ??? sends up a really nice set of computer 
        graphics to help Yuri get oriented as to the station views he will see.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We get a session 
        in on the IRED before the end of the workday. We do the cable and gear 
        inspection, and all looks normal. The forward canister is still scraping 
        its cable thimble. It sounds like light mechanical contact. We have taken 
        this apart 5 times now to reset it, most recently Monday, and it is still 
        unhappy. We are going to let the pieces fight it out.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep has a good Ham 
        Radio school contact with Merivale School, in Ottawa. We get about 15 
        excellent questions--this is a very worthwhile activity for station crews. 
        </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At the end of the 
        day we talk with TVIS engineers about the problems so far. We are no go 
        for treadmill ops for a while. We have shot several digital pictures of 
        the broken belt slats and the other ones that look suspect and they are 
        in the OCA down\DCS folder tonight. We are not looking forward to field-stripping 
        the TVIS, but we have a feeling that one is coming. Just not tomorrow, 
        please.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Last thing today 
        is the FPP hookup, which is still having trouble connecting with the NCU. 
        We restart this several times with no joy. The SSC is talking to the NCU, 
        but the data downloads won't start coming in. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We could really use 
        some more power sockets in the Node. Especially for 5A.1 ops, where we 
        will have an SSC, access point, CBCS, IMAX, FPP, and maybe bar code reader 
        (if we ever get that working) all looking for electricity. Getting our 
        hands on another UOP will be most welcome. </font>

        0700 We are getting up-Shep heads right for the coffee locker, but Yuri 
        and Sergei have a small blood draw first thing after wakeup. After that, 
        it is a set up for "?????" which is Russian for octopus, because 
        that's what you look like with electrodes all over your body. We get words 
        from Houston that we are to stand down on the TVIS for the day-our exercise 
        periods have turned into an IFM to change out 2 broken slats on the treadmill.</font>
</p>
      <p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>[REDACTED 
        MATERIAL - 5 lines]</b></font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep starts on the 
        TVIS IFM, as the procedure looks easy and we only have to take off 6 screws. 
        Plus we want to get our exercise in. Pulling up the cover is not all that 
        straightforward. The instructions omit any mention of 2 screws which tie 
        in to the back of the cover through a blind "sleeve". These 
        have to come off so the cover can be pulled up. The slats come off readily, 
        and both are cracked completely through. 2 washers are missing from the 
        underside of the slats. Putting on the new slats is not simple. The nuts 
        backing the screws are "rivnuts" and most of these are spinning 
        freely in their holes on the treadmill belt. So getting them to thread 
        up is very difficult. Shep and Sergei finally manage to put on both slats 
        and get them torqued down. Lots of little hardware problems. The new screws 
        with the thread lock won't work, as they have too much friction with the 
        rivnut and we can't keep the rivnut from turning with the screw. So we 
        use the old ones. Now we test the belt, and the new slats are sticking 
        up maybe .010" from the rest of the belt surface. And the rubbing 
        with the back cover is unacceptable. So we pry up the cover to provide 
        more clearance between it and the belt. We get on the TVIS and do a run 
        and everything looks OK.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep and Sergei joke 
        about "Bayes' Theorem", which roughly states that knowing that 
        2 slats out of maybe 150 have failed in 115 days, one should be able to 
        calculate the probability that another will fail in the next 3 weeks-what 
        are the odds?</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We get a late start 
        on the network reconfiguration. We did manage some get ahead tasks yesterday, 
        so we are hoping that everything will level out by mid afternoon. The 
        PCS and SSC are already set up in the Lab, and the file server has an 
        Ethernet leg and power ready to go. We put the server in the Lab and power 
        it up, and it is running fine-it is still logically on the same network 
        as before when it lived in FGB. Then we start the real guts of the reconfiguration-setting 
        up the expansion chassis and backing up the server. The work goes slow-we 
        are still seeing very inconsistent performance from the "Ghost" 
        software for imaging disks. We spend almost all afternoon on this and 
        we work it until early p.m. We finally get the server reconfigured with 
        its new load, but we do not get to the RF Lan set up steps. We leave the 
        server on the Ethernet hardline for the time being. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri gets more "shumomer" 
        acoustic readings. This is way past our next most fun thing to do now. 
        </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mid afternoon, we 
        do an OCA media event and a spot for the Houston Rodeo. The OCA is reverting 
        to its previous mischief, where we are simplex comm. Everytime we want 
        to hear or speak, we have to toggle a button on the keyboard to switch 
        this. We think this has got to be a software problem. Sergei comes up 
        with a temporary fix where we swap the headset and speaker jacks, which 
        gets us through the session today. Unfortunately, comm. on the uplink 
        from the media rep was intermittently unreadable.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei gets on the 
        treadmill and quickly answers our earlier question about Bayes. Probability 
        100%--as we have another slat with a crack in it. We think the best thing 
        to do here is just keep running on TVIS and see what happens. </font>

        The good news-- bungees are doing well-TVIS is more stable at all speeds 
        than before we put them on. We have noted a "clacking" noise 
        for several days, and we finally pin it down to 2 cracked treads in the

        the belt. The crack goes across each tread, leaving 2 individual pieces. 
        The break is allowing the pieces to ride up a bit, and the occasional 
        "clack" is the piece rubbing the rear enclosure of the treadmill. 
        TVIS temperatures are normal-electric box-88.5, motor temp 90.7. The check 
        of the SLD cables shows that the plastic sheathing on the "left" 
        cable has a minor split in it. The metal cable is intact. See below for 
        more data on TVIS wires requested earlier.</font>

        President's Day. ??????? ????. We need it. Thinking a lot about how to 
        organize the lab. We are waiting on the "big picture" logistics 
        plan for 5A.1 so we can put stuff away now and not have to move it again. 
        We are also interested in whether the MPLM is going to be "combat 
        loaded" so that gear can move right into stowage locations without 
        a lot of sorting onboard.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We keep initiating 
        radio contacts with Moscow using callsign "Alpha" but we only 
        get " ???" back as a response. Wondering if there is a message 
        here. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We are exploring 
        the comm loop set ups. Any time panel 2 or 3 are "active" in 
        SM, and RSA 2 or 1 are in a public call with GND 3 or 4, then voice from 
        SM is going out S Band ( and maybe VHF as well). We are apparently "hot 
        mike" if the ICOM (???) is pushed. We're not sure what is happening 
        when button "1" is pushed-whether we are powering a transmitter 
        or not. We would like to have a way to listen for Sband calls in SM and 
        respond PTT. A simple diagram would sure go a long way here.<br><br>
        We notice today that the deck and overhead racks in the Node are oriented 
        180 degrees out from how they are arranged in the lab. We saw this a long 
        time ago on a training drawing and thought this was a drafting error. 
        Our apologies to DT for the comments on this-drawings were correct. We 
        can't figure out if this should be an SPN or a "Crew Squawk"? 
        Maybe those Shuttle guys just hooked up the lab backwards.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We have been receiving 
        CD ROM's from the ground via Shuttle which have been difficult to read. 
        We've had problems with both operational software and entertainment discs. 
        These occasionally have some foreign material on the surface which gets 
        in the way of the disk reader hardware. The new Russian laptop software 
        image was the most significant example. We think there is some glue residue 
        left on the disks from sticky notes or labels. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We are most certainly 
        enjoying the DVD players-they are great! We are ready for movie night 
        with the ground! A big "Alpha" thanks to all the folks who worked 
        this-Hiep/Maury/Judy/Carol/Sue/Keith/Steve/Gabrielle + Karl King and Scott 
        Stubbs. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei cranks up 
        two excellent software apps that came up on 5A. The first is a very detailed 
        "World Map" which runs on Russian laptop 3. Detail on the map 
        is down to the "Webster TX" level. The second app is outstanding 
        even by Russian standards-a combined bird's eye view, world map, and star 
        field which runs on the Russian PCS. It also reads state vector and attitude 
        quaternion updates directly on the bus. Very slick. (Now if we could get 
        a couple of large format LCD screens to hang in the front of the Central 
        Post, we could give "Enterprise" a run).</font>

        to Houston and the correct file was thought to be onboard, but ground 
        suspects the KFX file transfer had problems. Houston resends. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We give ground the 
        bad news on the PMA 3 CPA panel. We noted sometime during the last part 
        of gear transfer that one of the electrical connector stubs (on CPA 3 
        we think) is snapped off at the base. The connector is loose, and the 
        metal sleeves for the individual wiring are visible inside the break.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> More bad news-we 
        have also noticed that the wires which ride up and down between the isolator 
        "bars" and the TVIS platform are breaking. All the top sets 
        of wires are broken-on all 4 corners. Other sets on the bars are damaged 
        or broken as well. Each bar presently has 2 functional pairs of wire attachments. 
        We are sending digital pictures down tonight.<br>
        We do more of the Lab setups today-condensate "T" installation 
        and the Node filter replacement. We spend the rest of the day cleaning 
        up the wiring and rigging in the Lab. Wire trays are going to prove very 
        handy. We have put down 3 sections so far. We have the PCS and SSC 3 now 
        located on rack panel S6-they are handy to the ATU, and the rack surfaces 
        are easier to work around. We could do a bit better location job if we 
        had some more run on the 1553 data line for the PCS.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We finish the day 
        with IMAX cleaning and we get 2 shots in the lab done. Both are gear transfer 
        scenes with the "Orlan" and some camera moves. (F 5.6, 40mm

        a normal day. Yuri and Shep take out the capture latches from the Node 
        vestibule and tie off all the electrical connectors. We install the closeout 
        cover around the sides of the vestibule. We are waiting to close out the 
        overhead, as we still have the Sband jumper interference problem. We note 
        the closeout cover is hemmed backwards. <br><br>

</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We continue the 
        lab setup from Sunday. The main task is to activate the AR rack, with 
        all the CO2 and contaminant removal equipment. We spend some time hunting 
        for the "condensate T" which we finally find at the bottom of 
        a CTB. Rigging the umbilicals to the AR rack proves far from easy. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In the middle of 
        the 2nd EVA, we catch Beemer and Tom outside the lab window. Sergei does

        EVA crew, sunrise-it doesn't get much better. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We have to slice 
        the foam off of the LTL "T" sample valve just to get enough 
        clearance to put it on. Even so, it has a very tight fit with part of 
        the rack structure, and will go on only one way. None of the larger lines 
        are "fairlead"-which is to say free of sharp bends or interference 
        with other connections. We float the AR rack "up" out of its 
        fittings, and take off all the umbilical support structure. This frees 
        all the lines up considerably. (all not part of the procedure). </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We take a break about 
        midnight for some chow. Houston calls --the Sband IFM message is onboard, 
        and MPEG movies for the procedure will come up overnight. We peruse the 
        message over some chicken fajitas and decide we can do it now. (We are 
        very ready for some better comm.) We clear the decks, break out the large 
        vise-grips, and about 15 minutes later, the connector is clocked correctly 
        and installed. We parley with Houston for some email, which we haven't 
        seen for a day and a half. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Back to the AR rack 
        in the Lab--we are supposed to insulate the LTL "T" connector, 
        but all the insulation got used the day before on the IMV valve job. We 
        "milk" the rubber insulation sleve down enough and tape it down. 
        It'll have to do. Putting on the thermal mitten on the water lines is 
        a significant battle. Shep and Sergei work this one item for 1 &frac12; 
        hours, moving things and trying to get it over the connectors without 
        destroying something. We finally put it up and get it latched. We are 
        still not real happy with the fit, but it is on. Houston brings up the 
        comm. in the lab, and we are very glad that the IFM is OK , and the ATU's 
        really work.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We wrestle the MCA 
        vacuum jumper in place, which is a 25' armored line about 3" in diameter. 
        It takes a "come along" line to get the hose up to the couplings, 
        as the jumper is so rigid. We finally get this mated around 0230 and the 
        next job is to open a vacuum valve to the MCA. The procedure has a callout 
        for the "utility door". Of course, there's no marking on the 
        ARS rack which says this. We even have a cue card on the rack face (these 
        are great, by the way), and this does not indicate which door we need 
        to open either. We start taking the launch bolts off all the doors to 
        hunt around. In the process, one of the washers floats down inside the 
        rack-we can't retrieve it because our hands are full of the other 40 non-captive 
        fasteners we just took off. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">0300-We talk to Houston 
        and tell them we have a lost washer in the rack. Houston is discussing 
        unhooking everything we just made up, as nobody's sure the washer won't 
        get into something critical. We are determined not to lose the day's work, 
        and we are hunting the entire lab for the washer. No joy. We pop the rack 
        out of its fittings and shake it to bring the washer up. This also does 
        not work. We finally inventory every loose launch fastener in the lab, 
        and we are still short one washer. We finally get the word around 0430 
        that ground has decided the filtration screens in the rack systems will 
        block the washer, and we call it a night. </font>

        We have been waiting a long time for this day. Moscow's on the VHF with 
        some comments about the central post computer work and software reloads. 
        Russian laptop is still "offline" with no data. The US PCS won't 
        come up and talk to the C&amp;C MDM either. We switch over to Houston 
        and get more words and updates on the day's plan. OCA has been reconnected 
        to the early comm. system so we have the messages and mail onboard we 
        have missed for the last day or so. We value email to the ground highly-even 
        a day of not having it is disagreeable.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We try the few other 
        computer tricks we know and the PCS won't come on line. The shuttle PCS 
        is not up either. We are OK without computer comm for a while today, but 
        doing the outfitting will certainly be less efficient without a handy 
        computer. <br><br>
        We have spent a lot of time organizing books, tools, cables, ODF, computers, 
        cameras, etc. in the Node. The module is a forest of wiring, bags, and 
        gear. It's time equalize pressure in the vestibule and open the Node hatch 
        to get ready for ingress. We visit with several Atlantis crew and coordinate 
        a "go" time. We want to send TV down and we are also getting 
        ready to shoot the first IMAX scene "as it happens". Don't know 
        that we can get this "in" with all the things that are converging, 
        but we are trying. With both UOP's offline in the Node, we are having 
        to get real inventive to put power to the IMAX lights. We get late word 
        to clean the camera-we don't have time to do it per procedure so we just 
        hook up the vacuum cleaner and give the mechanism a shot.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It's go time for 
        the hatch opening. Taco hands Shep the DD 250 for the "end user". 
        We are honored to sign--just hope the bill does not come with it. Sergei's 
        cranking the IMAX, goggles down, and we're all going in. The lab is well 
        lit, very spacious, and clean. (probably the last time we'll be able to 
        say that). We spend several minutes just looking around our new home. 
        Even with many racks yet to be plugged in, the lab is a very impressive 
        piece of hardware. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Marsha and Taco start 
        orchestrating all the outfitting tasks. We are all feeling very pressed 
        for time, particularly with the computer problems. Exp-1 was trained on 
        some of the activities months ago, but having the Shuttle crew right on 
        top of how to do everything is a big help. </font>

        a PCS connection in the SM, so we consider if a laptop can talk to the 
        MDM's from the lab. This is not scheduled for today, but we put all the 
        hardware pieces together, with some IMS help from the ground, and plug 
        a laptop in the lab. We don't have time to dig for a procedure, and once 
        again, we use the training drawings to figure out which UOP and bus to 
        be on. We start the laptop-we are in. We also have SSC 3 dragged in from 
        the Node to provide OSTP and MPV support. The lab's mini-"central 
        post" is operational. The desktops, bogen brackets, and ethernet 
        goodies that Atlantis brought prove to be essential items. </font>

        bags, Taco pulling out plumbing, Sergei, Beamer, and Roman working in 
        the endcone on ducts and valves. Tom on the videocam. All is very much

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri does an exceptional 
        job finishing off the IMV valve installation and insulation job. We think

        the day on hardcopy data file, which is the way to go for this type of 
        work, but with so many hands, we don't have enough copies to keep up. 
        Shep can't find some of the procedures in MPV, and we learn later that 
        we need to reload a new MPV set for the new material. Somehow we missed 
        this word. The numbering system on the procedures is a big help in identifying 
        exactly which procedure is of interest, but we wish the numbers were somehow 
        unique-we have procedures in different systems groups with the identical 
        numerical "coordinates".</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We note today there 
        are several disconnects between Form 24 and OSTPV. Mid day chow times 
        for all of us do not agree. Actually, we think the Russian plan is a little 
        more realistic-the OSTPV has us "turning to" for a good 7 hours 
        before we get a break for lunch. We do not get the exercise periods in 
        for the day-we can not do the lab work and take time for it. Everyone 
        missed a period yesterday-for the same reason.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Impact driver gets 
        a workout today. Unbolting, rotating and installing the ARS rack reveals 
        some significant hardware problems. Mounting the K-bars, one of the holes 
        and threaded inserts in the boss on top of the rack looks to be misdrilled. 
        (We put calipers on this). Again, having drawings in hand on the rack 
        fittings is invaluable. There were some other fittings and launch closeouts 
        that we wrestled with. Sergei put the wrenches to one in particular that

        out alternate ways to do things, again, having had lots of practice on

        for the undocking, arranging cameras, opening up the large deck window. 
        We are pitched down what looks to be about 40-45 degrees. We have a great

        The cargo ship moves away below us-it's quick compared to a Shuttle departure. 
        We can see the outline of the spacecraft--the spotlight is pretty bright. 
        Even though it is a night pass over Russia, the snow and cloud cover make 
        the Earth background very visible. It looks a lot like twilight although 
        we are well past the terminator. The engine pulse on Progress is also 
        very visible and vehicle starts a slow rotation as well. We're observing 
        thru the large deck window. We try to get some video images on the camcorder 
        but the light level is very low. The Progress moves below and a little 
        bit forward on us. It is just a black speck now against the cloud cover. 
        The only way we can pick it up is that it does not appear to move with 
        the cloud cover. Sergei is using the laser rangefinder to get some trajectory 
        data on the departure. </font>

        (or "swabs", etc.) swap their "roles" for a short

        things we have done up here. We hope this will be a new addition to the

        and it is running ok. The other systems are happy, and we decide to wait

</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">0700 We are up and 
        getting ready for Friday. We are also ready for the weekend. This may 
        be the last relatively free one we have for a while.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">First work today 
        is to check out why ??? is showing bad "konservant" quality. 
        Sergei and Shep look at the hardware, the mal procedure, and the drawings. 
        After a few test cycles, the indication clears. We had run out of flush 
        water last night, but this was refilled prior to this. Maybe some kind 
        of transient flow problem. The indication has not reappeared. Gotta love 
        those drawings. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep goes into the 
        Node to restart SSC 3 and run some more FPP data takes. SSC 3 boots and 
        loads service packs 5 and 6 without error, and FPP experiment looks nominal.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri is working almost 
        the entire a.m. on stowing gear in Progress and updating the IMS database. 
        Almost every moveable object in SM with a bar code is now in the database.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep starts the Node 
        ITCS quick-disconnect procedure in OCA 1048 with some help from Sergei. 
        There's a fine picture in the procedure, but we can't access the place 
        the arrows are pointing to without removing an additional panel, NOD 1S2-33. 
        Then, when this panel is off, we are looking at permanent insulation surrounding 
        the water lines and something is definitely amiss. We pull off the other 
        panel called out, NOD 1 D2-14, and can see only "gamah" fittings 
        and no identifying markings at all. We write up a quick note for Houston 
        so ground can read about the problems as we are talking to Expedition 
        2 on OCA.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1315 We try to get 
        OCA comm. with Exp 2 for about 20 minutes and we don't have a full 2-way 
        link. Exp 2 is at the BME console, and we do have good comm. with the 
        front room. So about 1340 or so, we do the crew tag up with the crew at 
        the Capcom console. Comm is still lower quality than we are used to, but 
        we are able to respond to all the questions. Apparently Yuri U has sent 
        Yuri G. 4 emails recently which have not been received on this end.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After lunch, Shep 
        downlads the CMG data. Everything looks normal with the CMG's. Data listed 
        in the last section.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei and Shep start 
        the RAMV checkout procedure. The knob in the Node does not have numbered 
        positions on it, so we make up the correct markings with black pen and 
        tape and put these on. (We also noted today that numerous fire port decals 
        in the Node are identified with panel numbers which are incorrect-they 
        don't agree with the numbers of the panels they are on). Getting started 
        with the RAMV procedure, Shep enables the valve and gets a failure indication 
        right away. We wait to talk to Houston on this one also.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri gets his monthly 
        treadmill check on the TVIS with the Russian monitoring gear. TVIS is 
        working OK.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We do a PAO contact 
        with MSFC to open the Payload Ops Center for station. Voice quality is 
        good, maybe a bit better than the usual OCA comm. with Houston. We are 
        happy that we have some payload activity to talk about even before the 
        center is in official operation.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We get some more 
        words from Capcom regarding the Node quick disconnects-we are looking 
        at the wrong lines (but we had a lot of help from the picture). Also, 
        the panel access to the other set of QD's is behind a different panel 
        than that called out. RAMV problem is a simple fix-we just did not have 
        the RPC on before we started.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep goes back in 
        the Node and disconnects the 2 QD's we can access, takes some closeout 
        photos, and puts the paneling back in place. We are going to ask to pick 
        up the rest of the procedure Mon. It involves moving a lot of gear on 
        D1 panel, and we just did not have time for that today. We have all the 
        excess foam and some other light trash stowed there for Progress. We didn't 
        get to the rest of the RAMV job either, so we are requesting that be moved 
        to early next week as well. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We get more word 
        from the Capcoms late in the day that we should not plan on Shuttle taking 
        down the 20 empty non-collapsible food containers. This is going to be 
        OK with us, as we think all will fit in Progress. Thanks for the timely 
        answer.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We finish the day 
        in the "sport-zal" and catch the early showing of "Tombstone" 
        in the wardroom.</font>

</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">IWIS day. After the 
        initial comm. check and breakfast, we go through the ops summary and the 
        8 o' clock report. The "red" change text is a very useful addition. 
        Yuri starts into the logistics work-he is getting his arms around everything 
        for the 5A transfer-we have a number of questions on this which are listed 
        at the end of the log.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep starts in the 
        Node rigging the IWIS hardware. Moving the RSU to port works well with 
        the cable runs. Everything is made up so it is out of the way as much 
        as possible. Getting gear out of the IWIS bag is unwieldy, as there are 
        lots of loose cables, pieces, and ziplock bags flying around. A packet 
        floats out with EVA fresnel lenses in it-this definitely belongs somewhere 
        else. We would prefer to see things packed so they can not float around 
        so much once a bag is open.<br><br>
        Putting in the accelerometers goes slowly, particularly for the location 
        behind the S4 closeout. The photo is not at all clear, and it takes maybe 
        20 minutes just to figure out exactly what the procedure is trying to 
        explain. This is definitely the case where a single good sketch or simple 
        drawing would be much better. We stick the forward accelerometer in place 
        also, exactly as described in the procedure and photo, and realize after 
        all the data takes that the X, Y, Z orientation markings on the sensor 
        do not agree with the station global coordinates. X on the sensor is pointed 
        in the minus Y direction on station. Please advise what is correct here.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei and Yuri are 
        loading more sound level meter data onto laptop 3. This is now becoming 
        our really most favorite thing to do. </font>

        "alarm" situation. We don't request any more watches be sent 
        up on 5A, but thanks to all the crew equipment folks for asking. As a 
        heads-up to Exp 2, any plans to use the timex download capability should 
        include more laptop IR transmitters. We have 1 onboard, but more will 
        be required if the next crew wants to fully use this capability.</font>
