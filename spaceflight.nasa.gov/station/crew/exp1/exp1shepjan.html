      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei and Yuri spend 
        considerable time downloading the sound meter data to Russian laptop 3. 
        The laptop has a modem for the Regul comm. link, and this is about twice 
        as fast as the packet data transfer on the ??? radio. This will probably 
        become the prime data channel up to the SSC network on the Russian side. 
        </font>

        Electric box temps 92.4, motor temp is 88.0. Thanks to the BME's for all 
        the info on the TVIS issues. We are using the wrist bracelet rigged backwards 
        as a means to provide grounding. The alligator clip is attatched to clothing, 
        and the wrist strap is on the bottom of the TVIS control panel. This prevents 
        the grounding wire from interfering with running motion on the treadmill. 
        As an interim solution for the static charge build up, this is working. 
        </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At 1350 we do a PAO 
        downlink with 2 media contacts. Lots of questions about our long term 
        habitability and general adaptation to lengthy space missions. As we were 
        getting ready for the event, we did ask Capcom and PAO whether we should 
        be ISS or "Alpha" on one of the presentations. We would like 
        to suggest the following as a working solution:</font>

        Shep and Sergei do the BP/ECG check-Sergei is the operator and Shep the 
        subject. We hook up the ECG to the MEC computer and everything is run 
        per the steps in OCA 1107. We have good traces on the ECG and the MEC 
        seems to handshake OK on its RS 232 bus. The program runs as expected 
        on the MEC. Just as a check, we look at the size of the data file written 
        by the program and it appears to be Zero K. We don't think there is any 
        data recorded-If ground could look at this and advise, please.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We took a look at 
        the IWIS rigging again today, with an eye to a permanent location. Lead 
        #4 from the port hatch area does not have enough length to reach the RSU 
        2 unit in its nominal position anyway, so we are going to have to do something. 
        We talk with Houston and we are going to try the RSU shifted to the portside 
        about 3 feet. We think all the lead wires will be OK and this is to be 
        tested tomorrow. </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">0720 We are in contact 
        with Moscow. Changes to the big plan today. Everyone agrees we don't need 
        to unload PMA3 right now-just need the IWIS gear out. There are still 
        questions about whether we can power the MACE experiment with the FPP 
        data being taken simultaneously. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We are REALLY liking 
        the 8 O'Clock report. This should help streamline some of the stuff in 
        the Daily Summary also. We notice the proposal in the summary to do the 
        8 O'Clock and the Daily Summary together with Moscow. Can a joint Mars 
        mission be far off?</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We have the monthly 
        body mass measurement this a.m. and the lower leg volume measurement. 
        All the data looks very consistent. Sergei is doing a lot of photo documentation 
        to provide for updates for some of the photos in the procedures.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep and Yuri update 
        the file server with service pack 7. No problems. We reboot the server 
        and it runs well all day. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We get the IWIS bag 
        out of PMA 3. Of course, it is in the bottom of the PMA. Knowing the barcode 
        is a very helpful addition to the info from the ground, except that the 
        IWIS bag is one of the few left that we have not marked so it can be read 
        from a distance. But by process of elimination, we figure it is the bottom 
        bag, and this proves to be true. Getting this out and restowing what was 
        removed takes maybe 15 minutes.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep does the monthly 
        treadmill test (PFE). Data is being sent to the CheCS folder. Sergei and 
        Yuri are changing the ??? hose and this normally would have been a schedule 
        conflict (we are all in the same space), but we saw this coming and the 
        job was done early.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We have a school 
        contact by ham radio right before lunch. Very clear contact with George 
        West School in Texas. We got to answer 20+ questions on the pass, and 
        they all were excellent. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We get the word from 
        Houston that MACE will have to standby until the FPP experiment data has 
        been collected. No MACE for the day. This works out OK for us, as we now 
        have a chance to get into Z1 and pull out gear we will need for 5A. We 
        take the IRED down, and open the Z1 hatch. We locate the "portable 
        fan" half-CTB and pull it out. Putting the IRED back, one of the 
        short rod assemblies (turnbuckles) gets bound up. The "banjo" 
        end fitting has about 5 threads to go but the turnbuckle sleeve is seized 
        tight to the threads on the "short" end. Threads are shiny, 
        and maybe it's just that tolerances on the threads are too tight. We put 
        80+ foot lbs on the turnbuckle body with no load on the long end, and 
        it won't move in either direction. We are going to need a replacement 
        piece at some point. Part number 46117199-302, S/N 1007.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei and Yuri get 
        to take more data with the "Shumomer" (sound level meter) which 
        is fast becoming our most fun thing to do. Sergei and Yuri also get laptop 
        3 rigged in the large diameter of Service Module, and this involves an 
        extensive redo of the ethernet cabling. This, however, is a good excuse 
        to clean up the network layout a bit, and now the "Y" legs in 
        the wiring are gone and we have one continuous backbone for the SM subnet. 
        Almost all of the cabling is behind panels or in the 1" wire trays, 
        and if anything, it looks too good. Crews will wonder for a long time 
        what we were complaining about regarding the planning and integration 
        of laptop locations.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We have been working 
        with the Timex software. Many thanks to the folks who got this up to us. 
        It seems we each have a different version of the datalink watch, and of 
        course, the software is different with each. Yuri and Sergei are able 
        to load up a day's worth of alarms, but Shep has the Datalink 150, and 
        this has a 5 alarm limit. So 2/3 of the crew are now happy. All this is 
        a pretty good argument for training like you are going to fly-we should 
        have caught this one ourselves in our training work on the ground.</font>

        TVIS series bungee system as part of the monthly inspection. We have all 
        been using the same bungee set since Nov. With a new unused bungee, we 
        should be fine through the remainder of the flight. We could use some 
        words from the ground whether Exp-2 will bring their own bungee sets so 
        we know what to leave behind. We still consider the bungee we removed 
        to be serviceable, but we are packing it up and will have it ready to 
        send to the ground so engineers may inspect-we thought this might be of 
        interest too. It is more time efficient to use one set of bungees for 
        all 3 crew than to swap these individually for each exercise session.</font>

        It was said that this tragedy would bring a long period of renewed endeavor 
        in space-that we would fly more safely and with greater success. This 
        has been realized. Let us take pride in the many good missions which have 
        flown since, and account this the continuing legacy of Challenger and 
        her crew. <br>
        Today we are working and living in space--a new era, a new enterprise--the 
        permanent presence of humans away from planet Earth. As a concept, it's 
        not that exceptional. We have always been in the "frontier" 
        business. <br>
        Infinite, boundless dimensions define "space". Our need to explore 
        and to fulfill the human potential defines us. Space is austere, harsh, 
        unforgiving--but as logical a place for us to be as any path that man 
        ever walked. It is "high ground" for the human experience. Let 
        the name "Challenger" give us pause to reflect on, and purpose 
        to continue--our voyage of exploration and discovery.</font>

        Yuri has the first job of the day, checking CO2 levels with the Carbon 
        Dioxide Monitoring Kit. We spent considerable time yesterday trying to 
        find it. We had rearranged its loc er stowage last week. The CDMK was 
        in the right location, but had a lot of bags on top of it and was difficult 
        to locate. We have written large bar code numbering on each side of the 
        bag, and this is a help particularly in the FGB. Yuri changes out batteries 
        and starts the monitor. Percentages agree pretty well with the readings 
        from the onboard gas analyzers. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sergei is testing 
        out the Blood pressure/ECG kit. Shep and Sergei are reading the instructions. 
        It takes a while to figure out that you have to hold the electrodes or 
        the BP cuff won't inflate. The procedure is kind of unclear on this, but 
        at least everything works.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shep starts the MACE 
        troubleshooting in the Node. We step through the procedure and finally 
        get the MACE to operate after a PC card is swapped out in the secondary 
        drive. The protocol we tested with, 11001, looks OK. The first protocol 
        on the priority list is run, but it does not look as though MACE is doing 
        anything. We call this down to the ground and Houston says this is expected. 
        We only had time to run one more protocol and temp stowed the experiment 
        so Yuri could pump some iron with the IRED.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri, Sergei and 
        Shep are working with the IMS for several hours in the afternoon. The 
        SSC's are running normally-no significant slowdowns like we saw two days 
        ago. Shep is stepping through OCA 1136 for answers to all the ground's 
        questions. <br>
        We have a tagup on OCA late in the afternoon with IMS folks. This is very 
        helpful, and we are able to clear up how some unique problems were generated 
        by the bar code reader. We still have an inordinate number of things onboard 
        whose bar codes are not logged into the database. Now that we are trying 
        to run the system with these codes as the primary identifier, it takes 
        a lot of time when we run into items that have bar codes and the database 
        can't find them. We discuss this with the ground and agree that a top 
        ground priority is to input this data, starting with computer equipment, 
        and things we will need to use when 5A is in town.</font>

        has occasionally been making "scraping" sounds. On inspection, 
        the bottom cover has a light groove where it has been making contact with

        After lunch, Yuri and Shep start the calibration procedure for the IRED. 
        At about the "8" load level, the forward canister starts scraping 
        again. Yuri and Shep take the canister apart twice trying to improve the 
        position of the cable hardware for adequate mechanical clearance. The

        the squat bars. It was another strange tool day. We used the large pliers 
        several times, and the impact driver was the only way we could have taken 
        apart the IRED can 3 times in the day. <br>
        We have noted that the power tool battery charger will not charge the

        all inputting transactions and the system seems like it just can't keep 
        up. Calls for data on individual objects has been taking 3-5 seconds. 
        Today it seems like even the routine data from the server has significant 
        delay-sometimes taking up to 4 minutes to complete. "History" 
        pages are particularly slow in downloading. After a while, Sergei reboots

        Working on IMS today. It is amazingly slow going trying to fix the database. 
        And it is very hard just to work on one thing at a time. It's a network 
        of incorrect things that are all intersecting.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">During the OCA fix 
        yesterday, the "Russian" scopemeter was hooked up to the US 
        power supply, but the batteries did not take a charge after several hours. 
        We're not sure the charger circuit is working properly, but we plan on 
        looking in to this soon. We have a limited supply of "C" batteries 
        as backups, but it would be better not to have to rely on these.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri is going through 
        all the gear deployed now in the Service Module and checking whether it 
        is correctly reflected in the database. Almost everything is stuff that 
        we moved very early on in the mission and we did not generally have time 
        to work the inventory. We have to stop now and recount what we did, when, 
        and where to figure it all out.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1420 Ham radio contact 
        with Sherman Elementary in upstate NY. The comm. pass goes very well. 
        Had the questions in advance and this helps the pass proceed very rapidly. 
        We are continually surprised by the quality of the questions coming from 
        young audiences. We field approx 20 questions in an 8 minute period. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We had a good planning 
        conference with Houston and Moscow. We talked about scheduling for next 
        week, and general issues for the rest of the mission. We are very interested 
        to see any of the present options being discussed with the 5A delay, and 
        also whatever "strawman" plan is in work for the remainder of 
        the flight. OCA comm. quality is the best we have had. If it holds, we 
        are ready to try the mid term debrief when there is time next week.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We tag up with the 
        SSC team on OCA, and discuss the 5A network transition. One of the key

        leaving everything set up.</font>

        TVIS, and this seemed like a good time to shoot photos of the SLD cable 
        that we thought had some wear to it. 3 photos taken and sent down in the 
        Checs folder tonight. Photos 240 and 250 are left cable, 260 is right. 
        We thought there was a small flaw in the sheath on the left cable but 
        it turns out that it is some kind of paint or marking. There is nothing 
        wrong with the cable. We looked at the right cable and it has a smaller 
        but similar mark, and is otherwise normal. </font>

        We have some scraping noise on the forward canister at loads above "8"

        Got the word that Atlantis is delayed several weeks. Lab delay is critical 
        as we are running out of movies that we have not watched. We will have 
        to start the shipboard routine where we turn the sound down and everyone 
        mouths the words, cause we know them so well. We will, however, have more 
        time to get ready for all the lab activation and installation jobs, and 
        we might even have the IMS sorted out by the time Atlantis docks.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We crank up the body 
        mass measuring rig to get the numbers for each crew. Getting this set 
        up is sort of an art-Yuri has got it down, however, and once it is running 
        right, this takes about 2 minutes to do.</font>

        scheduled to unload PMA 3, but this has been cancelled as a result of 
        the 5A changes. Shep and Yuri given the a.m. to work inventory. Yuri starts 
        in on the database with a large pile of notes.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We decide today would 
        be a good time to fix the OCA headset cable, as the appearance of a replacement 
        unit has just moved right a few weeks. Shep and Sergei pull out the scopemeter 
        and start checking the continuity on the connector pins. The diagram in 
        the OCA message is a big help. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We find fairly quickly 
        that the "sleeve" wire does not connect between both ends of 
        the cable on the leg to the microphone jack. We cut the wiring and do 
        a check again, and isolate the problem to the end with the 1/8" plug, 
        which fortunately, is right where we made the cut. Tried to take the plug 
        apart, but this was all glued together. We pulled the wiring off a set 
        of Sony CD speakers to get another jack that would fit the back of the 
        laptop. We stripped and spliced the wire, which was very fine-24, maybe 
        26 gauge. We don't want to use our few butt splices for this, and the 
        wires are too fine anyway, so we pull out the soldering iron to see how 
        that works. <br><br>
        First problem is that we can't plug the iron in. Plugs are Mir-style, 
        and apparently the sockets in the SM are different (more leads). So we 
        do another IFM to hook the iron up. Then the little soldering tube on 
        the end won't fit the iron-it's the wrong size. So out comes the Contingency 
        Clamp Kit and we safety wire the tube to the end of the iron. It works. 
        We tin the leads, put some tubing on them and insulate with electric tape. 
        ( The Russian side did provide this, and it does work.) We get the cable 
        hooked up, and do a mike check. We have an OCA hookup with the Chief Astronaut 
        and the system is working. That's the good news. Bad news is that we now 
        have another failure-looks like the earphone cable is bad-maybe the same 
        type of wire-connector failure. .Today's IFM took us maybe 3 &frac12; 
        hours. But the external laptop speakers are working and we have the OCA 
        comm. link back. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In all, we have recently 
        experienced-a scopemeter we can't recharge because we can't plug it in, 
        a soldering iron which has the wrong size tips, which we can't plug in 
        either, a vise we can't use because it's still on the ground, and "rivnuts" 
        we can't use because we don't have the right drill bits. Not to mention 
        a workbench that's still on the ground somewhere too. We are enjoying 
        finding all these "surprises" particularly before we would need 
        these tools to do something critical. It would be nice, however, just 
        to be able to pull these things out and start using them. We would like 
        to encourage a better process to integrate and check this gear before 
        we see it.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We also need to expand 
        the "pin kit" to include Russian-size pins and sockets, and 
        more wire splicing gear. The kit is very useful as is, but it is stocked 
        for a short Shuttle flight, and we need higher quantities of consumables 
        like butt splice connectors. (We only have 4 each of 2 sizes--one IFM 
        could use them all and then some). We also need wire and connectors to 
        make up our own cables as required-we can not rely on Shuttle or Progress 
        to bring us cables from the ground on short notice.</font>

        MPEV starts a substantial flow. Station drops to 750 and then 745 mm, 
        about what was predicted. We open the hatch and PMA 2 is very warm inside. 
        CPA's are warm as well. Everything inside is significantly warmer than 
        the rest of station, and the Node is rather hot right now. We go right 
        at the duct clamps and pull the duct out so the latch test can begin. 
        The whole interference with the latch arm looks to be a design problem.

        it gets better heat exchange. Yuri's working making a thermal blanket 
        for the compressor. Shep helps with the design and layout work. We have 
        a little marlinspike seamanship session with the sail palms and needles. 
        We start stitching up a blanket from cargo bag material. CTB serial 2992-1J

        all the steps that were on the troubleshooting message and a few that 
        weren't. Software was reloaded, expansion chassis swapped, spare headset 
        tested, etc. Audio was still bad. We were trying to find a spare microphone 
        which could be hooked up to the OCA which would localize the comm. problem. 
        We don't have any other microphone onboard which has a compatible jack 
        or connector, so we try hooking up a set of earphones to the mic jack. 
        Talking into the speakers seems to drive the test lights on the audio 
        input display. We try a test a bit later with Houston, and though we are 
        broadcasting somewhat "backwards" through the gear, it works.

        Although Sergei does not need to do this because of his height, the elongation

        (about 3/8"), wrapped on the piping. Although a bit thick for the

        Houston has a priority request to take down the berthing camera and look 
        through the Node forward hatch at one of the latches for the forward CBM. 
        Apparently the latch did not travel its full run when tested. We move 
        a bunch of bags off of the Node D1 area and remove the camera. We can 
        see latches 1 and 2 in different positions, and the #2 latch is right 
        up against some red rubber ductwork. We tell ground what we are looking 
        at and have some brief discussion about going in PMA 2 to fix. Looking

        set the load at anything above about 65-70 kg, the cables get pulled all 
        the way to mechanical contact with the pulley, and load to the user will 
        not increase. We thought we had been using the TVIS at considerably higher 
        forces, but apparently this is not the case. We all have our harnesses 
        "two-blocked" (pulled all the way up) and the adjustment still

        was not clear that the OCA message was a new procedure. Hunted around 
        the Med Ops Book for the "old" procedure, but couldn't find 
        one. There is definitely more of a tendency on a computer to read things 
        one screen at a time, Details which would have explained this were on

        Up at the usual zero-6-something. IMS-Day. Talking to Moscow and looking 
        at the overnight mail and execute package. The browser is working well, 
        and this is a much more convenient system for finding things than doing 
        it on paper. Searches on the messages onboard folder could be better, 
        but it is workable. A keyword search feature here would be most useful.</font>

        the OCA messages about the IMS details. Printer is still acting up and 
        printing half pages. We have been feeding it strange paper, (green) and 
        wonder if that has offended it. We try the reboot technique sent up from 
        the ground, and that seems to help for a while. Then the printer goes 
        back to its old ways. We would still like to know how to change permissions 
        so that the client SSC's can cancel print jobs in the print queue-we are 
        still blocked from doing this.</font>

        ???'s ???'s and all the salfetkies. We got through less than &frac12; 
        of what we expected to accomplish today. We discuss this with specialists 
        in Houston at the end of the workday, and we agree that we could use another 
        IMS day soon, preferably before 5A. We briefly discuss how we are going 
        to make sure that procedures incorporate the most recent gear moves, name 
        changes, etc. </font>

        stuck in RF mode. The BCR's however, have very limited battery life. Just 
        sitting on the wall charged but unused, they can go dead in less than 
        1 day. We discuss whether this might be a battery conditioning problem.

        have just crossed the 1,000 "traps" mark with the ???. Yuri

        kept jumping around. We will try and improve this for subsequent shots. 
        Shooting and downloading files is taking about 70 minutes total. Form 
        24 has 20 minutes scheduled on the plan. Just moving files off the PC 
        card probably takes 30-40 minutes. We are happy to do this-just would

        about whether we can reliably use the scopemeter for checking batteries. 
        We're not sure how to do this, as we think the battery has to be measured 
        under load to indicate its charge. Plan B is to just stick the battery 
        in the nearest flashlight and see how bright it is. Any more scopemeter

        antenna units which are to be placed in the ???. Two suits moving around

        Ground quickly got on top of that one and made sure we were on the correct 
        OCA message. Procedure to check data is much shorter and we are now very 
        familiar with it. Data take was quick and the results listed below in

        minute PAO event with Fox network and a Los Angeles radio station. The 
        OCA comm. went well We were asked to give a traffic report on the San 
        Diego freeway, but this was kind of hard as we were over the Indian Ocean 
        at the time. We could use a little more heads up on whether video down 
        will be part of the event. We were not sure about this today for the first

        the seed types in the hope one might be "palm tree". Digital 
        photos were JPEG'd and will be sent down in new folder OCA down\DCS\Jason.

        about 8 good questions from students. One question was about whether you 
        can ingest food the same way in orbit, or whether it moves differently 
        in your stomach. We said that it does feel different, but that you get 
        used to it. (Over to the docs on the real answer, and send that student

        0600 Right after getting up, noticed that the MEC finished its TEPC download 
        at 0500 (this download was started 1600 the day before-and estimated at 
        4 hours.) Confirmed MEC had the data in the correct downlink file. Forgot 
        that the network card was disconnected so that the TEPC could talk through 
        the MEC 232 port without interruption. Ground passed word to us after 
        lunch that MEC was not on the net and we reset the card. Hopefully TEPC 
        data got to the ground. TEPC powered and back online in its previous location.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We did the time update 
        on the SSC file server. When the server time was reset using the clock 
        icon from the system tray, the "apply" button was used. (procedure 
        did say use the "OK" button) This put the update program in 
        some type of loop which we could not get out of. Had to shut down the 
        server and restart. When the server came back up, correct time was resident. 
        We don't know if this is a one-time anomaly or there is some problem here.

        Yuri and Sergei unload the Orlan suits and spare parts from PMA 3. We 
        all spend about 2 hours in the Node between arranging suits and equipment 
        and setting up the MACE gear. Orlans were moved to the ??? which freed 
        up enough space in the Node for MACE to run. But the suit work in ??? 
        also blocks access to the Service Module for much of the day. It would 
        have also been an excellent training opportunity for Shep to review the 
        suit maintenance steps, and electrical, cooling, and pressure checks that 
        Yuri and Sergei were doing. We make a mental note that when we work on 
        the suits, we should just not have a lot of other things on the schedule.

        We have a lot of office-type material onboard which should be available 
        for subsequent expeditions. Apparently the big-picture plan is a bag-for 
        bag swap. We have consolidated some items in one central location-printer 
        paper, batteries, Ziploc bags as examples. We think some type of inventory 
        is the way we should manage this long term vice doing bag swaps.</font>

        count a lot of setup time to get ready for this step Quick break for chow, 
        and we talk to ??? about the schedule. We should have set aside 2 days

        comm. port is in the correct config. We think we did this port config 
        about 4 weeks ago after some troubleshooting for the polar watch. Anyway, 
        no changes were required, and hooked up the TEPC for a comm. check. At 
        first, the TEPC and MEC did a handshake, and TEPC kept dropping off after 
        35 seconds. Finally got the download program to run, and TEPC has been 
        downloading for 6+ hours and is still going. More words tomorrow.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Finished the day 
        discussing IMS with specialists in Houston. We think we can help the process 
        by quickly reviewing the intended changes for the data base that are generated 
        on the ground. This will help to preclude some of the previous disconnects 
        we have seen. We don't intend that this become SOP, only that we need 
        to do this in the short term to get the data somewhat stable and reliable. 
        We talk some other issues regarding inputs and bar coding. We are definitely 
        making progress, and we still feel that the IMS is the way to go-we just 
        have to stay on it.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
        We're up at the usual 0630 for first comm. with Moscow at 0640. We do 
        the lower leg measurements and the body mass calculations right after 
        comm. We have been chowing down pretty well, and the mass numbers reflect 
        that. Everybody is very close to what was recorded preflight.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri and Sergei are 
        unloading food containers from the stowage pantry in the SM. We are eating 
        virtually all the Russian chow, and somewhat less US stuff-maybe 75%. 
        We spend about 30 minutes pulling out the uneaten tomatoes and eggplant, 
        vanilla breakfast drinks, crackers, condiment packages, and dozens of 
        drinking water containers, and bagging them. The food boxes get stacked 
        in the passageway of the FGB and new containers are stowed in the pantry. 
        The empty boxes will be filled with small wet trash bags and put in Progress 
        soon.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By 1800, the Node 
        is organized, database is correct for things we worked with today in the 
        Node, and we have lots of room to do MACE experiments. MACE is now located 
        on NOD1 D1. Unpacked some of the hardware and started assembly but decided 
        the logistics work had to get done first. Knocked off at 1820 for some 
        PT.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For the interest 
        of the engineers, we took out the scopemeter and made some temperature 
        readings. Bulk air temp in the Node today (1600) was 88 deg F. It feels 
        just like Houston.<br>
        Temp directly on the skin of the PMA, at the cargo net, approx 16" 
        up from APAS was 95.2 deg F. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yuri and Sergei, 
        between several filter change outs in SM, worked the database all day 
        as well. Sergei and Shep consulted several times during the day reviewing 
        gear that had been transferred from 4A. We are definitely struggling with 
        IMS, logistics and the database, but all very determined to rope this 
        thing to the ground and make it work. Late in the day we ask Houston for 
        a time out tomorrow so we can discuss on OCA how we are going to better 
        control the data in and out of the database-this is key.</font>
