      <h3><font face="Arial,helvetica" color="003366">Expedition One Log Entries

      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">FROM: ALPHA</font>

        MAR</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We started this 
        morning thinking that this was going to be a relaxed schedule, but the 
        pace of the day keeps accelerating. The MPLM loading plan is coming together, 
        and it looks like the changes to the cargo load are minimal. We are pretty 
        surprised, however, when the laundry bags and dry trash bags get offloaded 
        as we don't have enough " margin". The operational utility of 
        the entire week with "Leonardo" could have been greatly increased 
        if we had more flexibility how to put cargo in it. There are also many 
        small details regarding outfitting which, if changed, would simplify the 
        act of bringing the MPLM aboard and making it ready. Grounding straps 
        is an example. In order to put the grounding straps on, two passive CBM 
        guides have to be removed. Plus the straps have to be fitted up and bent 
        to shape to line up the fasteners. The whole process takes at least 30 
        minutes. Some kind of jumper cable, such as a battery booster cable, which 
        would just clamp to the metal fittings on both sides of the docking ring, 
        would cut the time for this work to near zero. Isolating RACU/DDCU power 
        cables, putting in IMV jumpers, dealing with the "O" rings are 
        all activities which probably have more straightforward yet satisfactory 
        solutions which would help us configure more quickly. <br>
        We get an IMAX scene in, showing the MPLM-Node-Lab area. We hope this 
        one comes out well, as we had to use some inventive lighting techniques-we 
        are anxious to see how they worked. We finally get the MPLM secured and 
        egressed, and close the hatch. The deactivation, deoutfitting, etc. goes 
        as planned. We are working quickly with no missteps and we are still unable 
        to stay with the timeline. The Node hatch closure and vestibule leak check 
        starts out well, but a vacuum leak in the hose slows everything down some 
        more until the fittings are tightened. Finally the MPLM is moved away. 
        We start settling down to the other tasks on our plate. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Sergei gets a run 
        in on the TVIS, and it is making its clacking noise again. Yuri follows 
        with a session, and a piece of slat breaks off and gets caught in the 
        rear cover, and comes completely out of the tread. We take pictures and 
        send them down. TVIS is out of commission until the long tread slat replacement 
        procedure can be run.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We spent the rest 
        of the day configuring DAUI's, doing the CBCS test, taking condensate 
        samples, operating Chibis, shooting some more IMAX, and talking about 
        more of the outstanding handover items. We think we even found some answers 
        as to why the DZUS fasteners are hanging up----But it is time to leave 
        these details to the next crew. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> On the eve of Expedition 
        One's departure from the station, we would like to thank the many individuals 
        who have supported our mission-the fellow astronauts and cosmonauts who 
        have flown up and assembled pieces of hardware, and the many hundreds--even 
        thousands in the control centers on the ground who have made "Alpha" 
        a reality. We will remember this time always as a most special episode 
        in our lives and as a highlight of our space programs. </font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> To this end, it 
        is a tradition for the skipper of the first crew aboard a new vessel to 
        designate those individuals who are to be considered "Plankowners":</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>All Astronauts, 
        and Cosmonauts, who flew on Space Station Alpha for the purpose of building 
        or operating the station; and all Flight Directors, Flight Controllers, 
        and Operations Personnel who controlled Space Station "Alpha" 
        in space, from the initial launch of Zarya Nov. 1998 until the end of 
        the First Expedition 19 March 2001, are hereby designated as Space Station 
        Alpha "Plankowners". All rights and privileges, such as are 
        accorded by custom aboard naval ships, shall be conferred on said individuals.

        Change of command is an ancient naval tradition--the passage of responsibility 
        for mission, welfare of crew, and integrity of vessel--from one individual 
        to another. </b><br><br>
        Space Station Alpha has been commissioned in orbit. The service module 
        has been activated. The power element and laboratory module have been 
        brought aboard. A successful resupply mission with Discovery and her crew 
        is complete. Station is at normal condition--all systems functional and 
        ready to carry out operations</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We are on a true 
        space "ship" now, making her way above any Earthly boundary. 
        We are not the first crew to board "Alpha", or the last to depart. 
        But we have made "Alpha" come alive. We gave her a name, and 
        put substance to the ideas -</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">That our crews can 
        work together as equals--And our countries as partners.</font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>That we may proceed 
        with bolder and more enterprising voyages in space-with benefit from our 
        differences, and with stronger purpose in our common goals. </b></font>
</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We pass to your care 
        "Alpha's" log--with the hope that many successful entries are 
        recorded here---that explorations carried out onboard are prodigious, 
        and discoveries wondrous. May the good will, spirit, and sense of "mission" 
        we have enjoyed onboard--endure. Sail her well. </font>
