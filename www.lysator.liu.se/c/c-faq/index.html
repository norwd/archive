<h2>Frequently Asked Questions in comp.lang.c</h2>
[Last modified August 1, 1995 by scs.]
<p>
<hr>
WARNING: A major update to this FAQ list is imminent, probably on
September 1, 1995.<tt> </tt> Many questions will be rearranged and renumbered;
the sections may be rearranged and renumbered, also.<tt> </tt> If you're in the
habit of referring people to "question m.n in the FAQ list" or even
"section m in the FAQ list," they may be confused if they have a newer
version than this one.  During the changeover, the safest way to refer
people to sections is by name ("the section on memory allocation").
There isn't a good symbolic way to refer to a particular question, but
if you mention what the question is about, your recipient should be able
to find it.
<hr>
<p>
Certain topics come up again and again on this newsgroup.&#160;<tt> </tt>They are good
questions, and the answers may not be immediately obvious, but each time
they recur, much net bandwidth and reader time is wasted on repetitive
responses, and on tedious corrections to the incorrect answers which are
inevitably posted.
<p>
This article, which is posted monthly, attempts to answer these common
questions definitively and succinctly, so that net discussion can move
on to more constructive topics without continual regression to first
principles.
<p>
No mere newsgroup article can substitute for thoughtful perusal of a
full-length tutorial or language reference manual.&#160;<tt> </tt>Anyone interested
enough in C to be following this newsgroup should also be interested
enough to read and study one or more such manuals, preferably several
times.&#160;<tt> </tt>Some C books and compiler manuals are unfortunately inadequate;
a few even perpetuate some of the myths which this article attempts to
refute.&#160;<tt> </tt>Several noteworthy books on C are listed in <a href="index.html#bibliography">this article's
bibliography</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>Many of the questions and answers are cross-referenced to
these books, for further study by the interested and dedicated reader
(but beware of ANSI vs. ISO C Standard section numbers; see
<a href="c-5.html#5-1">question 5.1</a>).
<p>
If you have a question about C which is not answered in this article,
first try to answer it by checking a few of the referenced books, or by
asking knowledgeable colleagues, before posing your question to the net
at large.&#160;<tt> </tt>There are many people on the net who are happy to answer
questions, but the volume of repetitive answers posted to one question,
as well as the growing number of questions as the net attracts more
readers, can become oppressive.&#160;<tt> </tt>If you have questions or comments
prompted by this article, please reply by mail rather than following up
-- this article is meant to decrease net traffic, not increase it.
<p>
Besides listing frequently-asked questions, this article also summarizes
frequently-posted answers.&#160;<tt> </tt>Even if you know all the answers,
it's worth skimming through this list once in a while, so that when you
see one of its questions unwittingly posted, you won't have to waste time
answering.

This article was last modified on August 1, 1995, and its travels may
have taken it far from its original home on Usenet.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It may now be out&#173;of&#173;date,
particularly if you are looking at a printed copy or one
retrieved from a tertiary archive site or CD&#173;ROM.&#160;<tt> </tt>
You can always obtain
the most up&#173;to&#173;date copy by anonymous ftp from sites

This article was produced for free redistribution.<tt> </tt>You should not need
to pay anyone for a copy of it.
<p>
Other versions of this document are also available.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Posted along with
it are an abridged version and (when there are changes) a list of
differences with respect to the previous version.&#160;<tt> </tt>
A few preliminary
hypertext versions are available on the world&#173;wide web (WWW); see URL's<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/FAQ-List.html"

        Finally, for those who
might prefer a bound, hardcopy version (and even longer answers to even
more questions!), a book&#173;length version will be published by
<a href="http://www.aw.com">Addison&#173;Wesley</a>
in November, 1995 (ISBN 0-201-84519-9).

have goaded me beyond my inclination, and occasionally beyond my
endurance, in relentless pursuit of a better FAQ list.
