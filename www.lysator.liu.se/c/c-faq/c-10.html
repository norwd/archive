<h2>Section 10. Declarations</h2>
<p>
<h3>
<a name="10-1">
10.1:	How do you decide which integer type to use?
</a></h3><p>
  	If you might need large values (above 32767 or below -32767),
	use <code>long</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>Otherwise, if space is very important (there are
	large arrays or many structures), use <code>short</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>Otherwise, use
	<code>int</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>If well-defined overflow characteristics are important
	and/or negative values are not, use the corresponding <code>unsigned</code>
	types.&#160;<tt> </tt>(But beware of mixing <code>signed</code> and <code>unsigned</code> in
	expressions.)&#160;<tt> </tt>Similar arguments apply when deciding between
	<code>float</code> and <code>double</code>.
<p>
	Although <code>char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code> can be used as a &quot;tiny&quot; <code>int</code> type,
	doing so is often more trouble than it's worth, due to
	unpredictable sign extension and increased code size.
<p>
	These rules obviously don't apply if the address of a variable
	is taken and must have a particular type.
<p>
	If for some reason you need to declare something with an <em>exact</em>
	size (usually the only good reason for doing so is when
	attempting to conform to some externally-imposed storage layout,
	but see <a href="c-17.html#17-3">question 17.3</a>), be sure to encapsulate the choice behind
	an appropriate <code>typedef</code>.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="10-2">
10.2:	What should the 64-bit type on new, 64-bit machines be?
</a></h3><p>
  	Some vendors of C products for 64-bit machines support 64-bit
	long ints.&#160;<tt> </tt>Others fear that too much existing code depends on
	<code>sizeof(int)</code> == <code>sizeof(long)</code> == 32 bits, and introduce a
	new 64-bit<code> long long int </code>(or<code> __longlong</code>)&#160;<tt> </tt>type instead.
<p>
	Programmers interested in writing portable code should therefore
	insulate their 64-bit type needs behind appropriate typedefs.
	Vendors who feel compelled to introduce a new, longer integral type
	should advertise it as being &quot;at least 64 bits&quot; (which is truly
	new; a type traditional C doesn't have), and not &quot;exactly 64
	bits.&quot;
<p>

<h3>
<a name="10-3">
10.3:	I can't seem to define a linked list successfully</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>I tried</h3>
<p>
<pre>
	typedef struct
		{
		char *item;
		NODEPTR next;
		} *NODEPTR;
</pre>
<p><h3>
	but the compiler gave me error messages.&#160;<tt> </tt>Can't a struct in C
	contain a pointer to itself?
</h3><p>
  	Structs in C can certainly contain pointers to themselves; the
	discussion and example in section 6.5 of K&amp;R make this clear.
	The problem with this example is that the <code>NODEPTR</code> typedef is not
	complete at the point where the &quot;next&quot; field is declared.&#160;<tt> </tt>To
	fix it, first give the structure a tag (&quot;<code>struct node</code>&quot;).&#160;<tt> </tt>Then,
	declare the &quot;<code>next</code>&quot; field as &quot;<code>struct node</code> <code>*next;</code>&quot;, and/or move
	the <code>typedef</code> declaration wholly before or wholly after the struct
	declaration.&#160;<tt> </tt>One corrected version would be
<p>
<pre>
	struct node
		{
		char *item;
		struct node *next;
		};

	typedef struct node *NODEPTR;
</pre>
<p>
	, and there are at least three other equivalently correct ways
	of arranging it.
<p>
	A similar problem, with a similar solution, can arise when
	attempting to declare a pair of <code>typedef</code>'ed mutually referential
	structures.

<h3>
<a name="10-4">
10.4:	How do I declare an array of N pointers to functions returning
	pointers to functions returning pointers to characters?
</a></h3><p>
  	This question can be answered in at least three ways:
<p>
<ol>
<li><code>char *(*(*a[N])())();</code><p>
<li>Build the declaration up in stages, using typedefs:<p>
<code>
        typedef char *pc;       /* pointer to char */</code><br><code>
        typedef pc fpc();       /* function returning pointer to char */</code><br><code>
        typedef fpc *pfpc;      /* pointer to above */</code><br><code>
        typedef pfpc fpfpc();   /* function returning... */</code><br><code>
        typedef fpfpc *pfpfpc;  /* pointer to... */</code><br><code>
        pfpfpc a[N];            /* array of... */</code><p>
<li>Use the cdecl program, which turns English into C and vice versa:
<p>
<code>
	cdecl&gt; declare a as array of pointer to function returning
		 pointer to function returning pointer to char</code><br><code>
	char *(*(*a[])())()
</code>
<p>
	    cdecl can also explain complicated declarations, help with
	    casts, and indicate which set of parentheses the arguments
	    go in (for complicated function definitions, like the
	    above).  Versions of cdecl are in volume 14 of
	    comp.sources.unix (see <a href="c-17.html#17-12">question 17.12</a>) and <a href="index.html#K-amp-RII">K&amp;R II</a>.
</ol>
<p>
	Any good book on C should explain how to read these complicated
	C declarations &quot;inside out&quot; to understand them (&quot;declaration
	mimics use&quot;).

<h3>
<a name="10-5">
10.5:	I'm building a state machine with a bunch of functions, one for
	each state.</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>I want to implement state transitions by having
	each function return a pointer to the next state function.&#160;<tt> </tt>I
	find a limitation in C's declaration mechanism: there's no way
	to declare these functions as returning a pointer to a function
	returning a pointer to a function returning a pointer to a
	function...
</h3><p>
  	You can't do it directly.&#160;<tt> </tt>Either have the function return a
	generic function pointer type, and apply a cast before calling
	through it; or have it return a structure containing only a
	pointer to a function returning that structure.

<p><h3><a name="10-6">
10.6:   My compiler is complaining about an invalid redeclaration of a
        function, but I only define it once and call it once.</a></h3>
<p>
        Functions which are called without a declaration in scope (or
        before they are declared) are assumed to be declared as
        returning <code>int</code>, leading to discrepancies if the
	function is later declared otherwise.&#160;<tt> </tt>Non-int functions
	must be declared before they are called.

<h3>
<a name="10-7">
10.7:	What's the best way to declare and define global variables?
</a></h3><p>
  	First, though there can be many <em>declarations</em> (and in many
	translation units) of a single &quot;global&quot; (strictly speaking,
	&quot;external&quot;) variable (or function), there must be exactly one
	<em>definition</em>.&#160;<tt> </tt>(The definition is the declaration that actually
	allocates space, and provides an initialization value, if any.)
	It is best to place the definition in some central (to the
	program, or to the module) .c file, with an external declaration
	in a header (&quot;.h&quot;) file, which is #included wherever the
	declaration is needed.&#160;<tt> </tt>The .c file containing the definition
	should also #include the header file containing the external
	declaration, so that the compiler can check that the
	declarations match.
<p>
	This rule promotes a high degree of portability, and is
	consistent with the requirements of the <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> C Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>Note
	that Unix compilers and linkers typically use a &quot;common model&quot;
	which allows multiple (uninitialized) definitions.&#160;<tt> </tt>A few very
	odd systems may require an explicit initializer to distinguish a
	definition from an external declaration.
<p>
	It is possible to use preprocessor tricks to arrange that the
	declaration need only be typed once, in the header file, and
	&quot;turned into&quot; a definition, during exactly one #inclusion, via a
	special #define.

<h3><a name="10-8">
10.8:   What does</a><code> extern </code>mean in a function declaration?
</h3><p>
        It can be used as a stylistic hint to indicate that the
        function's definition is probably in another source file, but
        there is no formal difference between
<pre>
        extern int f();
</pre>
        and
<pre>
        int f();
</pre>

<p><h3>
<a name="10-9">
10.9:	I finally figured out the syntax for declaring pointers to
	functions, but now how do I initialize one?
</a></h3><p>
  	Use something like
<p>
<pre>
	extern int func();
	int (*fp)() = func;
</pre>
<p>
	When the name of a function appears in an expression but is not
	being called (i.e. is not followed by a &quot;(&quot;), it &quot;decays&quot; into a
	pointer (i.e. it has its address implicitly taken), much as an
	array name does.
<p>
	An explicit extern declaration for the function is normally
	needed, since implicit external function declaration does not
	happen in this case (again, because the function name is not
	followed by a &quot;(&quot;).
<p>

<h3>
<a name="10-10">
10.10:	I've seen different methods used for calling through pointers to
	functions</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>What's the story?
</h3><p>
  	Originally, a pointer to a function had to be &quot;turned into&quot; a
	&quot;real&quot; function, with the <code>*</code> operator (and an extra pair of
	parentheses, to keep the precedence straight), before calling:
<p>
<pre>
	int r, func(), (*fp)() = func;
	r = (*fp)();
</pre>
<p>
	It can also be argued that functions are always called through
	pointers, but that &quot;real&quot; functions decay implicitly into
	pointers (in expressions, as they do in initializations) and so
	cause no trouble.&#160;<tt> </tt>This reasoning, made widespread through pcc
	and adopted in the <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> standard, means that
<p>
<pre>
	r = fp();
</pre>
<p>
	is legal and works correctly, whether <code>fp</code> is a function or a
	pointer to one.&#160;<tt> </tt>(The usage has always been unambiguous; there
	is nothing you ever could have done with a function pointer
	followed by an argument list except call through it.)&#160;<tt> </tt>An
	explicit <code>*</code> is harmless, and still allowed (and recommended, if
	portability to older compilers is important).
