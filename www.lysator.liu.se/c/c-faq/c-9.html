<a name="9-1">
9.1:	What is the difference between an enum and a series of
	preprocessor #defines?
</a></h3><p>
  	At the present time, there is little difference.&#160;<tt> </tt>Although many
	people might have wished otherwise, the <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> standard says that
	enumerations may be freely intermixed with integral types,
	without errors.&#160;<tt> </tt>(If such intermixing were disallowed without
	explicit casts, judicious use of enums could catch certain
	programming errors.)
<p>
	Some advantages of enums are that the numeric values are
	automatically assigned, that a debugger may be able to display
	the symbolic values when enum variables are examined, and that
	they obey block scope.&#160;<tt> </tt>(A compiler may also generate nonfatal
	warnings when enums and ints are indiscriminately mixed, since
	doing so can still be considered bad style even though it is not
	strictly illegal).&#160;<tt> </tt>A disadvantage is that the programmer has
	little control over the size (or over those nonfatal warnings).

9.2:	I heard that structures could be assigned to variables and
	passed to and from functions, but <a href="index.html#K-amp-RI">K&amp;R I</a> says not.
</h3><p>
  	What <a href="index.html#K-amp-RI">K&amp;R I</a> said was that the restrictions on struct operations
	would be lifted in a forthcoming version of the compiler, and in
	fact struct assignment and passing were fully functional in
	Ritchie's compiler even as <a href="index.html#K-amp-RI">K&amp;R I</a> was being published.&#160;<tt> </tt>Although
	a few early C compilers lacked struct assignment, all modern
	compilers support it, and it is part of the <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> C standard, so
	there should be no reluctance to use it.

9.3:	How does struct passing and returning work?
</h3><p>
  	When structures are passed as arguments to functions, the entire
	struct is typically pushed on the stack, using as many words as
	are required.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Programmers often choose to use pointers to
	structures instead, precisely to avoid this overhead.)
<p>
	Structures are often returned from functions in a location
	pointed to by an extra, compiler-supplied &quot;hidden&quot; argument to
	the function.&#160;<tt> </tt>Some older compilers used a special, static
	location for structure returns, although this made struct-valued
	functions nonreentrant, which <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> C disallows.

9.4:	The following program works correctly, but it dumps core after
	it finishes.</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Why?</h3>

<pre>
	struct list
		{
		char *item;
		struct list *next;
		}

	/* Here is the main program. */

	main(argc, argv)
	...
</pre>
<p>
  	A missing semicolon causes the compiler to believe that main
	returns a structure.&#160;<tt> </tt>(The connection is hard to see because of
	the intervening comment.)&#160;<tt> </tt>Since struct-valued functions are
	usually implemented by adding a hidden return pointer, the
	generated code for <code>main()</code> tries to accept three arguments,
	although only two are passed (in this case, by the C start-up
	code).&#160;<tt> </tt>See also <a href="c-17.html#17-21">question 17.21</a>.

<p><h3><a name="9-5">
9.5:	Why can't you compare structs?
</a></h3><p>
  	There is no reasonable way for a compiler to implement struct
	comparison which is consistent with C's low-level flavor.&#160;<tt> </tt>A
	byte-by-byte comparison could be invalidated by random bits
	present in unused &quot;holes&quot; in the structure (such padding is used
	to keep the alignment of later fields correct;  see questions <a href="c-9.html#9-10">9.10</a> and 
<a href="c-9.html#9-11">9.11</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>A field-by-
	field comparison would require unacceptable amounts of
	repetitive, in-line code for large structures.
<p>
	If you want to compare two structures, you must write your own
	function to do so.&#160;<tt> </tt>
	C++ would let you arrange for the <code>==</code>
	operator to map to your function.

<p><h3><a name="9-6">
9.6:    How can I read/write structs from/to data files?</a></h3>
<p>
        It is relatively straightforward to write a struct out using
        <code> fwrite</code>:
<pre>
                fwrite((char *)&amp;somestruct, sizeof(somestruct), 1, fp);
</pre>
        and a corresponding<code> fread </code>invocation can read it back in.
        However, data files so written will <em>not</em> be very portable (see
        questions <a href="c-9.html#9-11">9.11</a> and <a href="c-17.html#17-3">17.3</a>).  Note also that on many systems you
        must use the "b" flag when fopening the files.
<h3>
<a name="9-7">
9.7:	I came across some code that declared a structure like this:
</a></h3><p>
<pre>
	struct name
		{
		int namelen;
		char name[1];
		};
</pre>
<p><h3>
	and then did some tricky allocation to make the name array act
	like it had several elements.&#160;<tt> </tt>Is this legal and/or portable?
</h3><p>
  	This technique is popular, although Dennis Ritchie has called it
	&quot;unwarranted chumminess with the C implementation.&quot;&#160;<tt> </tt>
	An <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a>
        Interpretation Ruling has deemed it (more precisely, access
        beyond the declared size of the<code> name </code>field) to be
	not strictly conforming, although a thorough treatment of the arguments
        surrounding the legality of the technique is beyond the scope of
        this list.&#160;<tt> </tt>It seems, however, to be portable to all known
        implementations.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Compilers which check array bounds carefully
        might issue warnings.)
<p>
        To be on the safe side, it may be preferable to declare the
        variable-size element very large, rather than very small; in the
        case of the above example:
<pre>
                ...
                char name[MAXSIZE];
                ...
</pre>
        where<code> MAXSIZE </code>is larger than any name which will be stored.
        (The trick so modified is said to be in conformance with the
        Standard.)

<a name="9-8">
9.8:	How can I determine the byte offset of a field within a
	structure?
</a></h3><p>
  	<a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> C defines the offsetof macro,
	which should be used if available; see &lt;stddef.h&gt;.&#160;<tt> </tt>
	If you don't have it, a suggested implementation is
<p>
<pre>
	#define offsetof(type, mem) ((size_t) \
		((char *)&amp;((type *) 0)-&gt;mem - (char *)((type *) 0)))
</pre>
<p>
	This implementation is not 100% portable; some compilers may
	legitimately refuse to accept it.
<p>
	See the <a href="c-9.html#9-8">next question</a> for a usage hint.
<p>
	References: <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> Sec. 4.1.5,
	<a href="../rat/c5.html#offsetof-3-5-4-2">Rationale Sec. 3.5.4.2 p. 55</a>.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="9-9">
9.9:	How can I access structure fields by name at run time?
</a></h3><p>
  	Build a table of names and offsets, using the <code>offsetof()</code> macro.
	The offset of field b in struct a is
<p>
<pre>
	offsetb = offsetof(struct a, b)
</pre>
<p>
	If structp is a pointer to an instance of this structure, and b
	is an int field with offset as computed above, b's value can be
	set indirectly with
<p>
<pre>
	*(int *)((char *)structp + offsetb) = value;
</pre>
<p>
<h3><a name="9-10">
9.10:	Why does </a><code>sizeof</code> report a larger size than I expect for a
	structure type, as if there was padding at the end?
</h3><p>
  	Structures may have this padding (as well as internal padding;
	see also <a href="c-9.html#9-5">question 9.5</a>), so that alignment properties will be
	preserved when an array of contiguous structures is allocated.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="9-11">
9.11:	My compiler is leaving holes in structures, which is wasting
	space and preventing &quot;binary&quot; I/O to external data files.</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Can I
	turn off the padding, or otherwise control the alignment of
	structs?
</h3><p>
  	Your compiler may provide an extension to give you this control
	(perhaps a <code>#pragma</code>), but there is no standard method.&#160;<tt> </tt>See also
	<a href="c-17.html#17-3">question 17.3</a>.
<p>

<h3><a name="9-12">
9.12:	Can I initialize unions?
</a></h3><p>
  	<a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> Standard C allows an initializer for the first member of a
	union.&#160;<tt> </tt>There is no standard way of initializing the other
	members (nor, under a pre-<a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> compiler, is there generally any
	way of initializing any of them).
<p>
<h3><a name="9-13">
9.13:   How can I pass constant values to routines which accept struct
        arguments?
</a></h3><p>
        C has no way of generating anonymous struct values.&#160;<tt> </tt>You will
        have to use a temporary struct variable.
