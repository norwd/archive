<h2>Section 1. Null Pointers</h2>
<h3><a name="1-1">
1.1:	What is this infamous null pointer, anyway?</a></h3>
<p>
  	The language definition states that for each pointer type, there
	is a special value -- the &quot;null pointer&quot; -- which is
	distinguishable from all other pointer values and which is not
	the address of any object or function.&#160;<tt> </tt>That is, the address-of
	operator <code>&amp; </code>will never yield a null pointer, nor will a
	successful call to<code> malloc</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>(<code>malloc </code>returns a null pointer when
	it fails, and this is a typical use of null pointers: as a
	&quot;special&quot; pointer value with some other meaning, usually &quot;not
	allocated&quot; or &quot;not pointing anywhere yet.&quot;)
<p>
	A null pointer is conceptually different from an uninitialized
	pointer.&#160;<tt> </tt>A null pointer is known not to point to any object; an
	uninitialized pointer might point anywhere.&#160;<tt> </tt>See also questions
	<a href="c-3.html#3-1">3.1</a>, <a href="c-3.html#3-13">3.13</a>, and <a href="c-17.html#17-1">17.1</a>.
<p>
	As mentioned in the definition above, there is a null pointer
	for each pointer type, and the internal values of null pointers
	for different types may be different.&#160;<tt> </tt>Although programmers need
	not know the internal values, the compiler must always be
	informed which type of null pointer is required, so it can make
	the distinction if necessary (see below).

<a name="1-2">
1.2:	How do I &quot;get&quot; a null pointer in my programs?</a></h3>
<p>
  	According to the language definition, a constant 0 in a pointer
	context is converted into a null pointer at compile time.&#160;<tt> </tt>That
	is, in an initialization, assignment, or comparison when one
	side is a variable or expression of pointer type, the compiler
	can tell that a constant 0 on the other side requests a null
	pointer, and generate the correctly-typed null pointer value.
	Therefore, the following fragments are perfectly legal:
<p>
<pre>
	char *p = 0;
	if(p != 0)
</pre>
<p>
	However, an argument being passed to a function is not
	necessarily recognizable as a pointer context, and the compiler
	may not be able to tell that an unadorned 0 &quot;means&quot; a null
	pointer.&#160;<tt> </tt><a name="1-2-execl">For instance, the Unix system call &quot;execl&quot;</a> takes a
	variable-length, null-pointer-terminated list of character
	pointer arguments.&#160;<tt> </tt>To generate a null pointer in a function
	call context, an explicit cast is typically required, to force
	the 0 to be in a pointer context:
<p>
<pre>
	execl(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;ls&quot;, (char *)0);
</pre>
<p>
	If the <code>(char</code> <code>*) </code>cast were omitted, the compiler would not know
	to pass a null pointer, and would pass an integer 0 instead.
	(Note that many Unix manuals get this example wrong.)
<p>
	When function prototypes are in scope, argument passing becomes
	an &quot;assignment context,&quot; and most casts may safely be omitted,
	since the prototype tells the compiler that a pointer is
	required, and of which type, enabling it to correctly convert
	unadorned 0's.&#160;<tt> </tt>Function prototypes cannot provide the types for
	variable arguments in variable-length argument lists, however,
	so explicit casts are still required for those arguments.&#160;<tt> </tt>It is
	safest always to cast null pointer function arguments, to guard
	against varargs functions or those without prototypes, to allow
	interim use of non-<a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> compilers, and to demonstrate that you
	know what you are doing.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Incidentally, it's also a simpler
	rule to remember.)
<p>
	Summary:
<p>
	Unadorned 0 okay:
<ul>
<li>initialization
<li>assignment
<li>comparison
<li>function call, prototype in scope, fixed argument
</ul>
Explicit cast required:
<ul>
<li>
	function call, no prototype in scope
<li>
	variable argument in varargs function call
</ul>

1.3:	What is</a><code> NULL </code>and how is it #defined?</h3>
<p>
  	As a matter of style, many people prefer not to have unadorned
	0's scattered throughout their programs.&#160;<tt> </tt>For this reason, the
	preprocessor macro <code>NULL </code>is #defined (by <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt; </code>or
	<code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code>), with value 0 (or <code>(void</code> <code>*)0</code>, about which more
	later).&#160;<tt> </tt>A programmer who wishes to make explicit the
	distinction between 0 the integer and 0 the null pointer can
	then use <code>NULL </code>whenever a null pointer is required.&#160;<tt> </tt>This is a
	stylistic convention only; the preprocessor turns <code>NULL </code>back to 0
	which is then recognized by the compiler (in pointer contexts)
	as before.&#160;<tt> </tt>In particular, a cast may still be necessary before
	<code>NULL </code>(as before 0) in a function call argument.&#160;<tt> </tt>(The table
	under <a href="c-1.html#1-2">question 1.2</a> above applies for <code>NULL </code>as well as 0.)
<p>
	<code>NULL </code>should <em>only</em> be used for pointers; see <a href="c-1.html#1-8">question 1.8</a>.

<h3>
<a name="1-4">
1.4:	How should</a><code> NULL </code>be #defined on a machine which uses a nonzero
	bit pattern as the internal representation of a null pointer?</h3>
<p>
  	Programmers should never need to know the internal
	representation(s) of null pointers, because they are normally
	taken care of by the compiler.&#160;<tt> </tt>If a machine uses a nonzero bit
	pattern for null pointers, it is the compiler's responsibility
	to generate it when the programmer requests, by writing &quot;0&quot; or
	&quot;<code>NULL</code>,&quot; a null pointer.&#160;<tt> </tt>Therefore, #defining <code>NULL </code>as 0 on a
	machine for which internal null pointers are nonzero is as valid
	as on any other, because the compiler must (and can) still
	generate the machine's correct null pointers in response to
	unadorned 0's seen in pointer contexts.
<p>
<h3><a name="1-5">
1.5:	If</a><code> NULL  </code>were defined as follows:
</h3><pre>
	#define NULL ((char *)0)
</pre><h3>
	wouldn't that make function calls which pass an uncast<code> NULL</code>
	work?</h3>
<p>
  	Not in general.&#160;<tt> </tt>The problem is that there are machines which
	use different internal representations for pointers to different
	types of data.&#160;<tt> </tt>The suggested #definition would make uncast <code>NULL</code>
	arguments to functions expecting pointers to characters to work
	correctly, but pointer arguments to other types would still be
	problematical, and legal constructions such as
<p>
<pre>
	FILE *fp = <code>NULL</code>;
</pre>
<p>
	could fail.
<p>
	Nevertheless, <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> C allows the alternate
<p>
<pre>
	#define NULL ((void *)0)
</pre>
<p>
	definition for <code>NULL</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>Besides helping incorrect programs to work
	(but only on machines with homogeneous pointers, thus
	questionably valid assistance) this definition may catch
	programs which use <code>NULL </code>incorrectly (e.g. when the ASCII&#160;<tt> </tt>NUL
	character was really intended; see <a href="c-1.html#1-8">question 1.8</a>).

<p>
  	This trick, though popular in some circles, does not buy much.
	It is not needed in assignments and comparisons; see

	null pointers valid?&#160;<tt> </tt>What if the internal representation for
	null pointers is nonzero?</h3>
<p>
  	When C requires the boolean value of an expression (in the <code>if</code>,
	<code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>do </code>statements, and with the <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code>, and <code>?:</code>
	operators), a false value is produced when the expression
	compares equal to zero, and a true value otherwise.&#160;<tt> </tt>That is,
	whenever one writes
<p>
<pre>
	<code>if(expr)</code>
</pre>
<p>
	where &quot;expr&quot; is any expression at all, the compiler essentially
	acts as if it had been written as
<p>
<pre>
	if(expr != 0)
</pre>
<p>
	Substituting the trivial pointer expression &quot;p&quot; for &quot;expr,&quot; we
	have
<pre>
	if(p)	is equivalent to     if(p != 0)
</pre>
<p>
	and this is a comparison context, so the compiler can tell that
	the (implicit) 0 is a null pointer, and use the correct value.
	There is no trickery involved here; compilers do work this way,
	and generate identical code for both statements.&#160;<tt> </tt>The internal
	representation of a pointer does <em>not</em> matter.
<p>
	The boolean negation operator, <code>!</code>, can be described as follows:
<p>
<pre>
	!expr   is essentially equivalent to    expr?0:1
</pre>
<p>
	It is left as an exercise for the reader to show that
<p>
<pre>
	if(!p)	is equivalent to	if(p == 0)
</pre>
<p>
	&quot;Abbreviations&quot; such as <code>if(p)</code>, though perfectly legal, are
	considered by some to be bad style.

  	No.&#160;<tt> </tt>Although symbolic constants are often used in place of

1.10:	I'm confused.</a>&#160;<tt> </tt><code>NULL </code>is guaranteed to be 0, but the null pointer
	is not?</h3>
<p>
  	When the term &quot;null&quot; or &quot;<code>NULL</code>&quot; is casually used, one of several
	things may be meant:
<ol>
<li>
The conceptual null pointer, the abstract language
		concept defined in <a href="c-1.html#1-1">question 1.1</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>It is implemented
		with...
<li>
The internal (or run-time) representation of a null
		pointer, which may or may not be all-bits-0 and which
		may be different for different pointer types.&#160;<tt> </tt>The
		actual values should be of concern only to compiler
		writers.&#160;<tt> </tt>Authors of C programs never see them, since
		they use...
<li>
The source code syntax for null pointers, which is the
		single character &quot;0&quot;.&#160;<tt> </tt>It is often hidden behind...
<li>
The <code>NULL </code>macro, which is #defined to be &quot;0&quot; or
		<code>&quot;(void</code> <code>*)0&quot;</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>Finally, as red herrings, we have...
<li>
The ASCII null character (NUL), which does have all bits
		zero, but has no necessary relation to the null pointer
		except in name; and...
<li>
The &quot;null string,&quot; which is another name for an empty
		string (&quot;&quot;).&#160;<tt> </tt>The term &quot;null string&quot; can be confusing in
		C (and should perhaps be avoided), because it involves a
		null (<code>'\0'</code>) character, but not a null pointer, which
		brings us full circle...
</ol>
	This article always uses the phrase &quot;null pointer&quot; (in lower
	case) for sense 1, the character &quot;0&quot; for sense 3, and the
	capitalized word &quot;<code>NULL</code>&quot; for sense 4.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="1-11">
1.11:	Why is there so much confusion surrounding null pointers?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Why
	do these questions come up so often?</h3>
<p>
  	C programmers traditionally like to know more than they need to
	about the underlying machine implementation.&#160;<tt> </tt>The fact that null
	pointers are represented both in source code, and internally to
	most machines, as zero invites unwarranted assumptions.&#160;<tt> </tt>The use
	of a preprocessor macro (<code>NULL</code>) suggests that the value might
	change later, or on some weird machine.&#160;<tt> </tt>The construct
	&quot;<code>if(p == 0)</code>&quot; is easily misread as calling for conversion of p to
	an integral type, rather than 0 to a pointer type, before the
	comparison.&#160;<tt> </tt>Finally, the distinction between the several uses
	of the term &quot;null&quot; (listed above) is often overlooked.
<p>
	One good way to wade out of the confusion is to imagine that C
	had a keyword (perhaps &quot;nil&quot;, like Pascal) with which null
	pointers were requested.&#160;<tt> </tt>The compiler could either turn &quot;nil&quot;
	into the correct type of null pointer, when it could determine
	the type from the source code, or complain when it could not.
	Now, in fact, in C the keyword for a null pointer is not &quot;nil&quot;
	but &quot;0&quot;, which works almost as well, except that an uncast &quot;0&quot;
	in a non-pointer context generates an integer zero instead of an
	error message, and if that uncast 0 was supposed to be a null
	pointer, the code may not work.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="1-12">
1.12:	I'm still confused.</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>I just can't understand all this null
	pointer stuff.</h3>
<p>
  	Follow these two simple rules:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
When you want to refer to a null pointer in source code,
use &quot;0&quot; or &quot;<code>NULL</code>&quot;.
<li>
If the usage of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;<code>NULL</code>&quot; is an argument in a
function call, cast it to the pointer type expected by
the function being called.
</ol>
<p>
	The rest of the discussion has to do with other people's
	misunderstandings, or with the internal representation of null
	pointers (which you shouldn't need to know), or with <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> C
	refinements.&#160;<tt> </tt>Understand questions <a href="c-1.html#1-1">1.1</a>, <a href="c-1.html#1-2">1.2</a>, and <a href="c-1.html#1-3">1.3</a>, and
	consider <a href="c-1.html#1-8">1.8</a> and <a href="c-1.html#1-11">1.11</a>, and you'll do fine.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="1-13">
1.13:	Given all the confusion surrounding null pointers, wouldn't it
	be easier simply to require them to be represented internally by
	zeroes?</a></h3>
<p>
  	If for no other reason, doing so would be ill-advised because it
	would unnecessarily constrain implementations which would
	otherwise naturally represent null pointers by special, nonzero
	bit patterns, particularly when those values would trigger
	automatic hardware traps for invalid accesses.
<p>
	Besides, what would this requirement really accomplish?&#160;<tt> </tt>Proper
	understanding of null pointers does not require knowledge of the
	internal representation, whether zero or nonzero.&#160;<tt> </tt>Assuming that
	null pointers are internally zero does not make any code easier
	to write (except for a certain ill-advised usage of calloc; see
	<a href="c-3.html#3-13">question 3.13</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>Known-zero internal pointers would not obviate
	casts in function calls, because the <em>size</em> of the pointer might
	still be different from that of an int.&#160;<tt> </tt>(If &quot;nil&quot; were used to
	request null pointers rather than &quot;0,&quot; as mentioned in <a href="c-1.html#1-11">question
	1.11</a>, the urge to assume an internal zero representation would
	not even arise.)
<p>
<h3>
<a name="1-14">
1.14:	Seriously, have any actual machines really used nonzero null
	pointers, or different representations for pointers to different
	types?</a></h3>
  
<p>The Prime 50 series used segment 07777, offset 0 for the null
	pointer, at least for PL/I.&#160;<tt> </tt>Later models used segment 0, offset
	0 for null pointers in C, necessitating new instructions such as
	TCNP (Test C Null Pointer), evidently as a sop to all the extant
	poorly-written C code which made incorrect assumptions.&#160;<tt> </tt>Older,
	word-addressed Prime machines were also notorious for requiring
	larger byte pointers (<code>char</code> <code>*</code>'s) than word pointers (<code>int</code> <code>*</code>'s).
<p>
	The Eclipse MV series from Data General has three
	architecturally supported pointer formats (word, byte, and bit
	pointers), two of which are used by C compilers: byte pointers
	for <code>char</code> <code>* </code>and <code>void</code> <code>*</code>, and word pointers for everything else.
<p>
	Some Honeywell-Bull mainframes use the bit pattern 06000 for
	(internal) null pointers.
<p>
	The CDC Cyber 180 Series has 48-bit pointers consisting of a
	ring, segment, and offset.&#160;<tt> </tt>Most users (in ring 11) have null
	pointers of 0xB00000000000.
<p>
	The Symbolics Lisp Machine, a tagged architecture, does not even
	have conventional numeric pointers; it uses the pair &lt;NIL, 0&gt;
	(basically a nonexistent &lt;object, offset&gt; handle) as a C null
	pointer.
<p>
	Depending on the &quot;memory model&quot; in use, 80*86 processors (PC's)
	may use 16 bit data pointers and 32 bit function pointers, or
	vice versa.
<p>
	The old HP 3000 series computers use a different addressing
	scheme for byte addresses than for word addresses; void and char
	pointers therefore have a different representation than an int
	(structure, etc.) pointer to the same address would have.

<p>
  	This message, which occurs only under MS-DOS (see, therefore,

	A debugger will usually let you set a data breakpoint on

	periodically check that it hasn't changed.
