<a name="6-1">
6.1:	How can I write a generic macro to swap two values?
</a></h3><p>
  	There is no good answer to this question.&#160;<tt> </tt>If the values are
	integers, a well-known trick using exclusive-OR could perhaps be
	used, but it will not work for floating-point values or
	pointers, or if the two values are the same variable (and the
	&quot;obvious&quot; supercompressed implementation for integral types
	<code>a^=b^=a^=b</code> is in fact illegal due to multiple side-effects; see
	questions <a href="c-4.html#4-1">4.1</a> and <a href="c-4.html#4-2">4.2</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>If the macro is intended to be used on values of
	arbitrary type (the usual goal), it cannot use a temporary,
	since it does not know what type of temporary it needs, and
	standard C does not provide a<code> typeof </code>operator.
<p>
	The best all-around solution is probably to forget about using a
	macro, unless you're willing to pass in the type as a third
	argument.

6.2:	I have some old code that tries to construct identifiers with a

	but it doesn't work any more.
</h3><p>
  	That comments disappeared entirely and could therefore be used
	for token pasting was an undocumented feature of some early
	preprocessor implementations, notably Reiser's.&#160;<tt> </tt><a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> affirms
	(as did K&amp;R) that comments are replaced with white space.
	However, since the need for pasting tokens was demonstrated and
	real, <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> introduced a well-defined token-pasting operator, <code>##</code>,
	which can be used like this:
<p>
<pre>
	#define Paste(a, b) a##b
</pre>

<h3>
<a name="6-3">
6.3:	What's the best way to write a multi-statement cpp macro?
</a></h3><p>
  	The usual goal is to write a macro that can be invoked as if it
	were a single function-call statement.&#160;<tt> </tt>This means that the
	&quot;caller&quot; will be supplying the final semicolon, so the macro
	body should not.&#160;<tt> </tt>The macro body cannot be a simple brace-
	delineated compound statement, because syntax errors would
	result if it were invoked (apparently as a single statement, but
	with a resultant extra semicolon) as the if branch of an if/else
	statement with an explicit else clause.
<p>
	The traditional solution is to use
<p>
<pre>
	#define Func() do { \
		/* declarations */ \
		stmt1; \
		stmt2; \
		/* ... */ \
		} while(0)	/* (no trailing ; ) */
</pre>
<p>
	When the &quot;caller&quot; appends a semicolon, this expansion becomes a
	single statement regardless of context.&#160;<tt> </tt>(An optimizing compiler
	will remove any &quot;dead&quot; tests or branches on the constant
	condition 0, although lint may complain.)
<p>
	If all of the statements in the intended macro are simple
	expressions, with no declarations or loops, another technique is
	to write a single, parenthesized expression using one or more
	comma operators.&#160;<tt> </tt>(See the example under <a href="c-6.html#6-10">question 6.10</a> below.
	This technique also allows a value to be &quot;returned.&quot;)

<a name="6-4">
6.4:	Is it acceptable for one header file to #include another?
</a></h3><p>
  	It's a question of style, and thus receives considerable debate.
	Many people believe that &quot;nested #include files&quot; are to be
	avoided: the prestigious Indian Hill Style Guide (see <a href="c-14.html#14-3">question
	14.3</a>) disparages them; they can make it harder to find relevant
	definitions; they can lead to multiple-declaration errors if a
	file is #included twice; and they make manual Makefile
	maintenance very difficult.&#160;<tt> </tt>On the other hand, they make it
	possible to use header files in a modular way (a header file
	#includes what it needs itself, rather than requiring each
	#includer to do so, a requirement that can lead to intractable
	headaches); a tool like grep (or a tags file) makes it easy to
	find definitions no matter where they are; a popular trick:
<p>
<pre>
	#ifndef HEADERUSED
	#define HEADERUSED
	...header file contents...
	#endif
</pre>
<p>
	makes a header file &quot;idempotent&quot; so that it can safely be
	#included multiple times; and automated Makefile maintenance
	tools (which are a virtual necessity in large projects anyway)
	handle dependency generation in the face of nested #include
	files easily.&#160;<tt> </tt>See also <a href="c-14.html">section 14</a>.

<h3>
<a name="6-5">
6.5:	Does the</a><code> sizeof </code>operator work in preprocessor #if directives?
</h3><p>
  	No.&#160;<tt> </tt>Preprocessing happens during an earlier pass of
	compilation, before type names have been parsed.&#160;<tt> </tt>Consider using
	the predefined constants in <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a>'s &lt;limits.h&gt;, if applicable, or
	a &quot;configure&quot; script, instead.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Better yet, try to write code
	which is inherently insensitive to type sizes.)

<h3>
<a name="6-6">
6.6:	How can I use a preprocessor #if expression to tell if a machine
	is big-endian or little-endian?
</a></h3><p>
  	You probably can't.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Preprocessor arithmetic uses only long
	ints, and there is no concept of addressing.)&#160;<tt> </tt>Are you sure you
	need to know the machine's endianness explicitly?&#160;<tt> </tt>Usually it's
	better to write code which doesn't care.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="6-7">
6.7:	I've got this tricky processing I want to do at compile time and
	I can't figure out a way to get cpp to do it.
</a></h3><p>
  	cpp is not intended as a general-purpose preprocessor.&#160;<tt> </tt>Rather
	than forcing it to do something inappropriate, consider writing
	your own little special-purpose preprocessing tool, instead.
	You can easily get a utility like make(1) to run it for you
	automatically.
<p>
	If you are trying to preprocess something other than C, consider
	using a general-purpose preprocessor (such as m4).
<p>

<h3>
<a name="6-8">
6.8:	I inherited some code which contains far too many </a><code>#ifdef</code>'s for
	my taste.&#160;<tt> </tt>How can I preprocess the code to leave only one
	conditional compilation set, without running it through cpp and
	expanding all of the <code>#include</code>'s and <code>#define</code>'s as well?
</h3><p>
  	There are programs floating around called unifdef, rmifdef, and
        scpp which do exactly this.  (See question <a href="c-17.html#17-12">17.12</a>.)
<p>

<h3>
<a name="6-9">
6.9:	How can I list all of the pre#defined identifiers?
</a></h3><p>
        There's no standard way, although it is a frequent need.&#160;<tt> </tt>If the
        compiler documentation is unhelpful, the most expedient way is
        probably to extract printable strings from the compiler or
        preprocessor executable with something like the Unix strings(1)
        utility.&#160;<tt> </tt>Beware that many traditional system-selective
        pre#defined identifiers (e.g. "<code>unix</code>") are non-Standard
	(because they clash with the user's namespace) and are being removed
	or renamed.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="6-10">
6.10:	How can I write a cpp macro which takes a variable number of
	arguments?
</a></h3><p>
  	One popular trick is to define the macro with a single argument,
	and call it with a double set of parentheses, which appear to
	the preprocessor to indicate a single argument:
<p>
<pre>
	#define DEBUG(args) (printf(&quot;DEBUG: &quot;), printf args)

	if(n != 0) DEBUG((&quot;n is %d\n&quot;, n));
</pre>
<p>
	The obvious disadvantage is that the caller must always remember
	to use the extra parentheses.&#160;<tt> </tt>Other solutions are to use
        different macros (<code>DEBUG1</code>,<code> DEBUG2</code>, etc.) depending on the number
        of arguments, or to play games with commas:
<pre>
        #define DEBUG(args) (printf(&quot;DEBUG: &quot;), printf(args))
        #define _ ,
        DEBUG(&quot;i = %d&quot; _ i)
</pre>
	It is often better to use a bona-fide function,
	which can take a variable number of arguments in a well-defined
	way.&#160;<tt> </tt>See questions <a href="c-7.html#7-1">7.1</a> and <a href="c-7.html#7-2">7.2</a>.
