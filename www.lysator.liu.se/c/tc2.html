<h1>ISO C Technical Corrigendum 2</h1>

<p>
ISO C Technical Corrigendum 2 (TC2) has been approved.
Even leaner than its predecessor <a href="tc1.html">TC1</a>, it
consists only of small changes in response to Defect Reports,
and will be of interest mostly to compiler and test suite vendors.
In a few cases, it codifies behavior that everybody knew was correct
but that was inadequately expressed in the Standard; in others, it changes
the name for something (or introduces a new one), but does not
affect behavior at all.
<p>
This text is based on Paul Eggert's summary of
Douglas A. Gwyn, ``C Standards Update'', <cite>The Journal of C Language Translation</cite>
<b>6</b>, 3 (March 1995), 150-156, with additional
material from Paul Eggert and Jutta Degener.
<ul>
<p>
<li> There is a new kind of storage duration, <i>allocated</i>.

	The objects that <code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code>, and
	<code>calloc</code> return have allocated storage duration.  Their
	lifetime ends with the end of the program or a call to <code>free</code>
	or <code>realloc</code>.

	<blockquote><font size=2>
		This does not change the behavior of any program;
		it just expresses something
		every C programmer knew implicitly.
	</font></blockquote>
<p>
<li> The following are now locale-specific, not implementation-defined:
  <ul>
  <li> shift states used for the encoding of multibyte characters
  <li> character sets for <code>isalnum</code>,
	<code>isalpha</code>,
	<code>iscntrl</code>,
	<code>islower</code>,
	<code>isprint</code>,
	<code>isupper</code>
  <li> the interpretation of <code>setlocale</code>'s second argument
	(if neither <code>"C"</code> nor <code>""</code>)
  <li> additional subject sequence forms for
	<code>strtod</code>,
	<code>strtol</code>,
	<code>strtoul</code>
  <li> <code>strerror</code>'s
	returned string
  </ul>
	<blockquote><font size=2>
		Strictly conforming programs - programs that rely on
		nothing but Standard C and behave the same on all its
		implementations - are allowed to exhibit locale-specific
		behavior, but not implementation-defined behavior.
		This change has made more programs strictly conforming.
	</font></blockquote>
<p>
<li> <code>va_start</code> and <code>va_end</code> must be invoked
  in corresponding pairs.
  The pairs cannot nest: for example, the behavior of `<code>va_start(a, foo);
  va_start(a, foo); va_end(a); va_end(a);</code>' is undefined.

<p>
<li> An incomplete structure or union type in
  one translation unit is compatible with a
  complete structure or union type in another
  unit.
	<blockquote><font size=2>
		For many years, C programmers have simulated abstract
		data types with pointers to incomplete structures or unions.
		Outside the implementing module, the pointer is treated as
		an opaque pointer type; inside, an additional structure or
		union declaration completes the type and gives access to
		its members.
		This change allows that practice.
	</font></blockquote>
<p>
<li> Freestanding environments can have reserved external identifiers.
<p>
<li> The implementation-defined integer type compatible with an enumerated type
  must be capable of representing the enumeration members' values.
<p>
<li> An enumerated type is complete
	at the <code>}</code> ending the enumeration.
	<blockquote><font size=2>
		Before TC2, the C standard did not specify
		when an enumerated type is completed.

	</font></blockquote>
<p>
<li> String literals need not be
distinct even if not identical, so long as their elements
have appropriate values.

For example, <code>("a" == "ba"+1 &amp;&amp; "a" == "a\0b")</code>
can yield 1.


A similar rule applies to wide string literals.
String and wide string literals can share space too;
for example, <code>("a" == (void *) L"a")</code> can yield 1.
<p>
<li>

      Passing a type (after promotion) not expected by a library function
      with variable number of arguments yields undefined behavior.
<p>
<li> `<code>return X;</code>' in <code>main</code> is not precisely equivalent
 to `<code>exit(X);</code>',
 since the dynamic storage of <code>main</code> vanishes as <code>main</code>
 returns.
	<blockquote><font size=2>
	For example, the following program has undefined behavior:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void goodbye(void)
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

int main(void)
{
    char buf[20];
    setvbuf(stdout, buf, _IOFBF, sizeof(buf));
    atexit(goodbye);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
	The program becomes strictly conforming if one replaces
	<code>main</code>'s <code>return 0;</code> with <code>exit(0);</code>.
</font></blockquote>
</ul>
There are some other minor wording changes.
