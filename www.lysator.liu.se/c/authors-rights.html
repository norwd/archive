<h1><img alt="" src="authors-rights.xbm" align="middle">&#160;<tt> </tt>Authors' Rights</h1>

   People whose names show up in this subtree have certain
   rights.&#160;<tt> </tt>That they have the rights doesn't mean
   they exercise them (e.g., take responsibility for the layout of their
   documents); but if they wanted to, they could.&#160;<tt> </tt>
   The idea is to leave those authors who don't want to be bothered
   alone, while still giving control to those who accept it.
   <p>
   <dl>
   <dt><a name="notification">The right to know.</a><p>
   <dd>
        If a text shows up in the Lysator hierarchy,
        the author will hear about that via email, if at
        all possible.&#160;<tt> </tt>(This has changed recently;
        I used to prefer to leave people alone,
        but have been convinced that that is neither expected
        nor advisable.)
   <p>
   <dt><a name="stop-playing">The right to stop playing.</a><p>
   <dd>
	All texts in this subtree are either published with explicit
	permission or have been made available in some big, anonymous
	electronic forum, usually through anonymous ftp or as a
	USENET article.&#160;<tt> </tt>If, however, at any point the author
	of a document doesn't want it to offered here, it will be
	removed and stay out of the subtree for good.
   <p>
   <dt><a name="change">The right to change the document.</a><p>
   <dd>
	If something was important or interesting enough to me to
	be included here, it is important or interesting enough to
	put in the work to track changes.&#160;<tt> </tt>If there's a new
	version available, it will replace the old one.
   <p>
   <dt><a name="html">Control over presentation and structure.</a><p>
   <dd>
	If you don't like the way your document looks on the screen,
	or have your own notion about how to best present your text,
	tell me about it.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Unless you already found a way
	to implement your style in HTML, don't expect it to be realized
	exactly; HTML's layout capabilities are rather limited.)
   <p>
   <dt><a name="image">The right to your own image.</a><p>
   <dd>
	Some people in this subtree appear not only as names, but also
	with a bitmapped image, a signature, affiliation, or a short
	biography.&#160;<tt> </tt>They can change, remove, or augment
	that data, just like they can change the documents they wrote
	themselves.&#160;<tt> </tt>
	(Still, the fact that something is said about or by someone in
	this subtree does not mean that the person knows about the
	statement, or agrees with it.)
   </dl>
   <p>
   Whatever changes need to be made to implement these rights will be made
   as fast as technically possible.&#160;<tt> </tt>
   Beyond that, comments, suggestions, and especially corrections are always,
   and equally, welcome from everybody; email to <i>jutta@pobox.com</i>.
