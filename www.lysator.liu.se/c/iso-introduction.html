<h1>Introduction</h1>

  With the introduction of new devices and extended character sets,
new features may be added to this International Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>Subclauses
in the language and library clauses warn implementors and programmers
of usages which, though valid in themselves, may conflict with future
additions.
<p>
  Certain features are <em>obsolescent</em>, which means that they may be
considered for withdrawal in future revisions of this International
Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>They are retained because of their widespread use, but
their use in new implementations (for implementation features) or
new programs (for language [6.9] or library features [7.13]) is
discouraged.
<p>
  This International Standard is divided into four major subdivisions:
<ul>
<li>the introduction and preliminary elements;

<li>the characteristics of environments that translate and execute
    C programs;

<li>the language syntax, constraints, and semantics;

<li>the library facilities;
</ul>
  Examples are provided to illustrate possible forms of the
constructions described.&#160;<tt> </tt>Footnotes are provided to emphasize
consequences of the rules described in that subclause or elsewhere
in this International Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>References are used to refer to
other related subclauses.&#160;<tt> </tt>A set of annexes summarizes information
contained in this International Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>The introduction, the
examples, the footnotes, the references, and the annexes are not
part of this International Standard.
<p>
  The language clause (clause 7) is derived from &quot;The C Reference
Manual&quot; (see annex A).
<p>
  The library clause (clause 8) is bases on the 1984 /usr/group
Standard (see annex A).
