<h1><a name="4-12">4.12</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Date and Time&#160;<tt> </tt>&lt;<a name="-60time-46h-62-4-12">time</a>.h&gt;</h1>

<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-1">4.12.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Components of time</h2>
<p>
The types <a name="clock-95t-4-12-1"><code>clock_t</code></a> and <a name="time-95t-4-12-1"><code>time_t</code></a>
are arithmetic because values of these types must,
in accordance with existing practice,
on occasion be compared with <i>-1</i>&#160;<tt> </tt>(a ``don't-know'' indication)
suitably cast.&#160;<tt> </tt>
No arithmetic properties of these types are defined by the Standard, however,
in order to allow implementations the maximum flexibility in
choosing ranges, precisions, and representations most appropriate to
their intended application.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The representation need not be a count of some basic unit;
an implementation might conceivably represent different components of
a temporal value as subfields of an integral type.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Many C environments do not support the
Base Document library concepts
of daylight savings or time zones.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Both notions are defined geographically and politically,
and thus may require more knowledge about the real world than
an implementation can support.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Hence the Standard specifies the date and time functions
such that information about DST and time zones is not required.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Base Document function <code>tzset</code>,
which would require dealing with time zones, has been
excluded altogether.&#160;<tt> </tt>
An implementation reports that information about DST is not
available by setting the <a name="tm-95isdst-4-12-1"><code>tm_isdst</code></a>
field in a broken-down time to a negative value.&#160;<tt> </tt>
An implementation may return a null pointer from a call to
<a href="d12.html#gmtime-4-12-3-3" name="gmtime-4-12-1"><code>gmtime</code></a>
if information about the displacement
between Universal Time (<i>n&eacute;e</i> GMT) and local time is
not available.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-2">4.12.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Time manipulation functions</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-2-1">4.12.2.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="clock-4-12-2-1"><code>clock</code></a> function</h2>

<p>
The function is intended for measuring intervals of execution time,
in whatever units an implementation desires.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The conflicting goals of high resolution, long interval capacity, and
low timer overhead must be balanced carefully in the light of this
intended use.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-2-2">4.12.2.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>difftime</code> function</h2>
<p>
<a name="difftime-4-12-2-2"><code>difftime</code></a>
is an invention of the Committee.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It is provided so that an implementation can store an indication
of the date/time value in the most efficient format possible and still provide
a method of calculating the difference between two times.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-2-3">4.12.2.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>mktime</code> function</h2>
<p>
<a name="mktime-4-12-2-3"><code>mktime</code></a> was invented by the Committee
to complete the set of time functions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
With this function it becomes possible to perform portable calculations
involving clock times and broken-down times.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The rules on the ranges of the fields within the <code>*timeptr</code> record
are crafted to permit useful arithmetic to be done.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For instance, here is a paradigm for continuing some loop for an
hour:
<pre>        #include &lt;time.h&gt;
        struct tm    when;
        time_t       now;
        time_t       deadline;

        /* ... */
        now = time(0);
        when = *localtime(&amp;now);
        when.tm_hour += 1;   /* result is in the range [1,24] */
        deadline = mktime(&amp;when);

        printf(&quot;Loop will finish: %s\n&quot;, asctime(&amp;when)); 
        while ( difftime(deadline,time(0)) &gt; 0 ) whatever();
</pre>The specification of <code>mktime</code> guarantees that the addition to
the <code>tm_hour</code> field produces the correct result even when
the new value of <code>tm_hour</code> is 24, i.e., a value outside the
range ever returned by a library function in a <code>struct</code> <code>tm</code> object.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
One of the reasons for adding this function is to replace the
capability to do such arithmetic which is lost when a programmer
cannot depend on <code>time_t</code> being an integral multiple of some
known time unit.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Several readers of earlier versions of this Rationale
have pointed out apparent problems in this example if <code>now</code>
is just before a transition into or out of daylight savings time.&#160;<tt> </tt>
However, <code>when.tm_isdst</code> indicates what sort of time was the basis of the
calculation.  
Implementors, take heed.&#160;<tt> </tt>
If this field is set to <i>-1</i> on input, one truly ambiguous case
involves the transition out of daylight savings time.&#160;<tt> </tt>
As DST is currently legislated in the USA, the hour 0100--0159 occurs
twice, first as DST and then as standard time.  Hence an unlabeled
0130 on this date is problematic.  An implementation may choose to
take this as DST or standard time, marking its decision in the <code>tm_isdst</code>
field.  It may also legitimately take this as invalid input (and
return <code>(time_t)(-1)</code>).
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-2-4">4.12.2.4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="time-4-12-2-4"><code>time</code></a> function</h2>

<p>
Since no measure is given for how precise an implementation's
<i>best approximation</i>
to the current time must be, an implementation
could always return the same date, instead of a more honest <i>-</i>1.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This is, of course, not the intent.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-3">4.12.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Time conversion functions</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-3-1">4.12.3.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="asctime-4-12-3-1"><code>asctime</code></a> function</h2>

Although the name of this function
suggests a conflict with the principle of
removing <a name="ASCII-4-12-3-1">ASCII</a> dependencies from the Standard,
the name has been retained due to prior art.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For the same reason of existing practice,
a proposal to remove the newline character from the string format
was not adopted.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Proposals to allow for the use of languages other than English
in naming weekdays and months met with objections on grounds of prior art,
and on grounds that a truly <a name="internationalization-4-12-3-1">international</a>
version of this function was difficult to specify:
three-letter abbreviation of weekday
and month names is not universally conventional, for instance.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The <code>strftime</code> function (<a href="d12.html#4-12-3-5">&#167;4.12.3.5</a>) provides appropriate
facilities for locale-specific date and time strings.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-3-2">4.12.3.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>ctime</code> function</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-3-3">4.12.3.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="gmtime-4-12-3-3"><code>gmtime</code></a> function</h2>

<p>
This function has been retained,
despite objections that <a name="GMT-4-12-3-3">GMT</a>
--- that is, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) ---
is not available in some implementations,
since UTC is a useful and widespread standard representation of time.&#160;<tt> </tt>
If UTC is not available, a null pointer may be returned.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-3-4">4.12.3.4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>localtime</code> function</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-12-3-5">4.12.3.5</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>strftime</code> function</h2>
<p>
<a name="strftime-4-12-3-5"><code>strftime</code></a> provides a way of formatting the date and time in
the appropriate locale-specific fashion, using the <code>%c</code>, <code>%x</code>,
and <code>%X</code> format specifiers.&#160;<tt> </tt>
More generally, it allows the programmer to tailor whatever date and
time format is appropriate for a given application.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The facility is based on the UNIX system <code>date</code> command.&#160;<tt> </tt>
See <a href="d4.html#4-4">&#167;4.4</a> for further discussion of locale specification.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
For the field controlled by <code>%P</code>, an implementation may
wish to provide special symbols to mark noon and midnight.
