<h1><a name="4">4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Library</h1>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-1">4.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Base Document for this section of the Standard was the
<a name="1984--47usr-47group-Standard-4-1">1984 /usr/group Standard</a>.
The /usr/group document
contains definitions of some facilities which were specific to the <a name="UNIX-4-1">UNIX</a>
Operating System and not relevant to other operating environments,
such as
pipes, ioctls, file access permissions and process control
facilities.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Those definitions were dropped from the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Some other functions were excluded from
the Standard because they were non-portable or were ill-defined.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Other facilities not in the library Base Document but present in
many UNIX implementations,
such as the <a name="curses-4-1">curses</a> (terminal-independent screen handling) library
were considered to be more complex and less essential
than the facilities of the Base Document;
these functions were not added to the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-1-1">4.1.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Definitions of terms</h2>
<p>
The <a name="decimal-point-character"><i>decimal-point character</i></a> is the character used in
the input or output of floating point numbers, and may be changed
by <code>setlocale</code>.  This is a library construct;  the decimal point
in numeric literals in C source text is always a period.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-1-2">4.1.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Standard headers</h2>
<p>
Whereas in prior practice
only certain library functions have been associated with header files,
the Standard now mandates that <i>all</i> library functions have a header.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Several headers have therefore been added,
and the contents of a few old ones have been changed.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
In many implementations the names of headers are the names of files
in special directories.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This implementation technique is not required, however:
the Standard makes no assumptions about the form that a file
name may take on any system.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Headers may thus have a special status if an implementation so chooses.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Standard headers may even be built into a translator,
provided that their contents do not become ``known''&#160;<tt> </tt>
until after they are explicitly included.&#160;<tt> </tt>
One purpose of permitting these header ``files'' to be ``built in''&#160;<tt> </tt>
to the translator is to allow an implementation of the C language
as an interpreter in an un-hosted environment,
where the only ``file'' support may be a network interface.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Committee decided to make library headers ``idempotent'' ---
they should be includable any number of times, and includable in any order.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This requirement, which reflects widespread existing practice,
may necessitate some protective wrappers within the headers, to avoid,
for instance, redefinitions of typedefs.&#160;<tt> </tt>
To ensure that such protective wrapping can be made to work,
and to ensure proper scoping of typedefs,
headers may only be included outside of any declaration.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Note to implementors: a common way of providing this ``protective
wrapping'' is:
<pre>        #ifndef __ERRNO_H
        #define __ERRNO_H
        /* body of &lt;errno.h&gt; */
        /* ...               */
        #endif
</pre>where <code>__ERRNO_H</code> is an otherwise unused macro name.
<p>

Implementors often desire to provide implementations of C
in addition to that prescribed by the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For instance, an implementation
may want to provide system-specific I/O facilities in <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
A technique that allows the same header to be used in both the
Standard-conforming and alternate implementations is to add the
extra, non-Standard, declarations to the header as in this illustration:
<pre>        #ifdef __EXTENSIONS__
        typedef int file_no;
        extern int read(file_no _N, void * _Buffer, int _Nbytes);
        /*...*/
        #endif
</pre>The header is usable in an implementation of the Standard in the absence
of a definition of <code>__EXTENSIONS__</code>, and the non-Standard implementation
can provide the appropriate definitions to enable the extra declarations.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-1-2-1">4.1.2.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Reserved identifiers</h2>
<p>
To give implementors maximum latitude in packing library functions into
files, all external identifiers defined by the library are reserved
(in a hosted environment).&#160;<tt> </tt>
This means, in effect, that no user supplied external names may match
library names,
<i>not even if the user function has the same specification</i>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus, for instance, <code>strtod</code> may be defined in the same object module as
<code>printf</code>,
with no fear that link-time conflicts will occur.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Equally, <code>strtod</code> may call <code>printf</code>, or
<code>printf</code> may call <code>strtod</code>, for whatever reason,
with no fear that the wrong function will be called.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Also reserved for the implementor are
<i>all</i> external identifiers beginning with an underscore,
and all other identifiers beginning with an underscore followed
by a capital letter or an underscore.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This gives a space of names for writing the numerous
behind-the-scenes non-external macros and functions
a library needs to do its job properly.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
With these exceptions, the Standard assures the programmer that
<i>all other</i> identifiers are available,
with no fear of unexpected collisions when moving programs
from one implementation to another.&#160;<tt> </tt>[Footnote: See <a href="c1.html#3-1-2-1">&#167;3.1.2.1</a> for a discussion of some of the precautions
an implementor should take to keep this promise.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Note also that any implementation-defined member names in structures
defined in <code>&lt;time.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;locals.h&gt;</code> must begin with an
underscore, rather than following the pattern of other names in
those structures.]&#160;<tt> </tt>
Note, in particular, that
part of the name space of internal identifiers beginning with underscore 
is available to the user --- translator implementors have not been the only
ones to find use for ``hidden'' names.&#160;<tt> </tt>
C is such a portable language in many respects that this issue of
``name space pollution''&#160;<tt> </tt>
is currently one of the principal barriers to writing completely portable code.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Therefore the Standard assures that macro and typedef names are
reserved only if the associated header is explicitly included.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-1-3">4.1.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Errors&#160;<tt> </tt><code>&lt;errno.h&gt;</code></h2>
<p>
<a name="-60errno-46h-62-4-1-3"><code>&lt;errno.h&gt;</code></a> is a header invented to encapsulate the
error handling mechanism used by many of the 
library routines in <code>math.h</code> and <code>strlib.h</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>[Footnote: 	In earlier drafts of the Standard, <code>errno</code> and related
	macros were defined in <code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
	When the Committee decided that the other definitions in
	this header were of such general utility that they should
	be required even in freestanding environments, it
	created <code>&lt;errno.h&gt;</code>.]&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The error reporting machinery centered about the setting of
<a name="errno-4-1-3"><code>errno</code></a> is generally regarded with tolerance at best.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It requires a ``pathological coupling'' between library functions and
makes use of a static writable memory cell,
which interferes with the construction of shareable libraries.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Nevertheless, the Committee preferred to standardize this
existing, however deficient,
machinery rather than invent something more ambitious.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The definition of <code>errno</code> as an lvalue macro
grants implementors the license to expand it to something like
<code>*__errno_addr()</code>,
where the function returns a pointer to the (current) modifiable copy of
<code>errno.</code>
<p>

<h2><a name="4-1-4">4.1.4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Limits&#160;<tt> </tt><code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code><a name="-60limits-46h-62-4-1-4"><code>limits</code></a><code>.h&gt;</code></h2>



<p>
Both <a name="-60float-46h-62-4-1-4"><code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code></a> and <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code> are inventions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Included in these headers are various parameters of the execution
environment which are potentially useful at compile time,
and which are difficult or impossible to determine by other means.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The availability of this information in headers
provides a portable way of tuning a program to different environments.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Another possible method of determining some of this information is
to evaluate arithmetic expressions in the
<a name="preprocessing-4-1-4">preprocessing</a> statements.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Requiring that preprocessing always yield the same results as
run-time arithmetic, however,
would cause problems for portable compilers (themselves written in C) or
for <a name="cross-compilation-4-1-4">cross compilers</a>,
which would then be required to implement the
(possibly wildly different) arithmetic
of the target machine on the host machine.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(See <a href="c4.html#3-4">&#167;3.4</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

<code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code>
makes available to programmers a set of useful quantities for
numerical analysis. (See <a href="b.html#2-2-4-2">&#167;2.2.4.2</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
This set of quantities has seen widespread use for such analysis,
in C and in other languages,
and was recommended by the numerical analysts on the Committee.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The set was chosen so as not to prejudice
an implementation's selection of floating-point representation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Most of the limits in <code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code> 
are specified to be general <code>double</code> expressions
rather than restricted constant expressions
<ul><li>to allow use of values which cannot readily
    (or, in some cases, cannot possibly)&#160;<tt> </tt>
    be constructed as manifest constants,
and
<li>to allow for run-time selection of floating-point properties,
    as is possible, for instance, in <a name="IEEE-854-4-1-4">IEEE-854</a> implementations.&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul><h2><a name="4-1-5">4.1.5</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Common definitions&#160;<tt> </tt><code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code></h2>
<p>
<a name="-60stddef-46h-62-4-1-5"><code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code></a>
is a header invented to provide definitions of several types and macros
used widely in conjunction with the library:
<a name="ptrdiff-95t-4-1-5"><code>ptrdiff_t</code></a> (see <a href="c3.html#3-3-6">&#167;3.3.6</a>),
<a name="size-95t-4-1-5"><code>size_t</code></a> (see <a href="c3.html#3-3-3-4">&#167;3.3.3.4</a>),
<a name="wchar-95t-4-1-5"><code>wchar_t</code></a> (see <a href="c1.html#3-1-3-4">&#167;3.1.3.4</a>),
and
<a name="NULL-4-1-5"><code>NULL</code></a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Including any header that references one of these macros will also
define it, an exception to the usual library rule that each macro or function
belongs to exactly one header.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<code>NULL</code> can be defined as any <a name="null-pointer-constant"><i>null pointer constant</i></a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus existing code can retain definitions of <code>NULL</code>
as <code>0</code> or <code>0L</code>,
but an implementation may choose to define it as <code>(void</code> <code>*)0</code>;
this latter form of definition is convenient
on architectures where the pointer size(s) do(es) not equal
the size of any integer type.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It has never been wise to use <code>NULL</code>
in place of an arbitrary pointer as a function argument, however,
since pointers to different types need not be the same size.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The library avoids this problem by providing special macros for the
arguments to <a name="signal-4-1-5"><code>signal</code></a>,
the one library function that might see a null function pointer.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

The <a name="offsetof-4-1-5"><code>offsetof</code></a>
macro has been added to provide a portable means of determining
the offset, in bytes, of a member within its structure.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This capability is useful in programs,
such as are typical in data-base implementations,
which declare a large number of different data structures:
it is desirable to provide ``generic'' routines
that work from descriptions of the structures,
rather than from the structure declarations themselves.&#160;<tt> </tt>[Footnote: 
Consider, for instance,
a set of nodes (structures) which are to be dynamically
allocated and garbage-collected, and which can contain pointers to
other such nodes.  A possible implementation is to have the first
field in each node point to a descriptor for that node.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The descriptor includes
a table of the offsets of fields which are pointers to other nodes.&#160;<tt> </tt>
A garbage-collector ``mark'' routine needs no further information
about the content of the node (except, of course, where to put the mark).&#160;<tt> </tt>
New node types can be added to the program without requiring the
mark routine to be rewritten or even recompiled.]&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
In many implementations, <code>offsetof</code> could be defined as one of
<pre>        (size_t)&amp;(((s_name*)0)-&gt;m_name)
</pre>or
<pre>        (size_t)(char *)&amp;(((s_name*)0)-&gt;m_name)
</pre>or,
where <code>X</code> is some predeclared address (or 0)&#160;<tt> </tt>
and <code>A(Z)</code> is defined as <code>((char*)&amp;Z)</code>,
<pre>        (size_t)( A( (s_name*)X-&gt;m_name ) - A( X ))
</pre>It was not feasible, however, to mandate any single one of these forms as
a construct guaranteed to be portable.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Other implementations may choose to expand this macro as a call to a
built-in function that interrogates the translator's symbol table.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-1-6">4.1.6</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Use of library functions</h2>
<p>
To make usage more uniform for both implementor and programmer,
the Standard requires that every library function
(unless specifically noted otherwise) must be represented as an actual function,
in case a program wishes to pass
its address as a parameter to another function.&#160;<tt> </tt>
On the other hand,
every library function is now a candidate for redefinition,
in its associated header,
as a macro,
provided that the macro performs a
``<a name="safe-evaluation-4-1-6">safe</a>''
evaluation of its arguments,
i.e., it evaluates each of the arguments
exactly once and parenthesizes them thoroughly,
and provided that its top-level operator is such that the execution of the macro
is not interleaved with other expressions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Two exceptions are the macros
<a name="getc-4-1-6"><code>getc</code></a> and <a name="putc-4-1-6"><code>putc</code></a>,
which may evaluate their arguments in an unsafe manner.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(See <a href="d9.html#4-9-7-5">&#167;4.9.7.5</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
If a program requires that a library facility
be implemented as an actual function,
not as a macro, then the macro name, if any, may be erased by using the
<a name="-35undef-4-1-6"><code>#undef</code></a> <a name="preprocessing-4-1-6">preprocessing</a> directive (see <a href="c8.html#3-8-3">&#167;3.8.3</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
All library prototypes are specified in terms of the
``<a name="widened-types-4-1-6">widened</a>'' types:
an argument formerly declared as <code>char</code> is now written as <code>int</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This ensures that most library functions can be called with or without
a prototype in scope (see <a href="c3.html#3-3-2-2">&#167;3.3.2.2</a>),
thus maintaining backwards compatibility with existing, pre-Standard, code.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Note, however, that since functions like <a name="printf-4-1-6"><code>printf</code></a> and <a name="scanf-4-1-6"><code>scanf</code></a>
use variable-length argument lists,
they must be called in the scope of a prototype.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Standard contains an example showing
how certain library functions may be ``built in''&#160;<tt> </tt>
in an implementation that remains <i>conforming</i>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
