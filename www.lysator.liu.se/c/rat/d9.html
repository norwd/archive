<p>
Many implementations of the C runtime environment
(most notably the <a name="UNIX-4-9">UNIX</a> operating system)&#160;<tt> </tt>
provide, aside from the standard I/O library
(<a name="fopen-4-9"><code>fopen</code></a>,
<a name="fclose-4-9"><code>fclose</code></a>,
<a name="fread-4-9"><code>fread</code></a>,
<a name="fwrite-4-9"><code>fwrite</code></a>,
<a name="fseek-4-9" href="d9.html#fseek-4-9-9-2"><code>fseek</code></a>),
a set of unbuffered I/O services
(<code>open</code>, <code>close</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>lseek</code>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee has decided not to standardize the latter set
of functions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
A suggested semantics for these functions in the UNIX world
may be found in the emerging <a name="IEEE-P1003-4-9">IEEE P1003</a> standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The standard I/O library functions use a <a name="file-pointer"><i>file pointer</i></a>
for referring to the desired I/O stream.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The unbuffered I/O services use a <i>file descriptor</i>
(a small integer)&#160;<tt> </tt>
to refer to the desired I/O stream.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Due to weak implementations of the standard I/O library,
many implementors have assumed
that the standard I/O library was used for small records
and that the unbuffered I/O library was used for large records.&#160;<tt> </tt>
However, a good implementation of the standard I/O library can match
the performance of the unbuffered services on large records.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The user also has the capability of tuning the performance of the standard
I/O library (with <a name="setvbuf-4-9"><code>setvbuf</code></a>) to suit the application.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Some subtle differences between the two sets of services
can make the implementation of the unbuffered I/O services difficult:
<ul><li>The model of a file used in the unbuffered I/O services is an array
of characters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Many C environments do not support this file model.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<li>Difficulties arise when handling the new-line character.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Many hosts use conventions other than an in-stream new-line character
to mark the end of a line.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The unbuffered I/O services assume that no translation occurs
between the program's data and the file data when performing I/O,
so either the new-line character translation would be lost
(which breaks programs)&#160;<tt> </tt>
or the implementor must be aware of the new-line translation
(which results in non-portable programs).&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<li>On UNIX systems,
file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 correspond to the standard input,
output, and error streams.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This convention may be problematic
for other systems in that (1) file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 may not
be available or may be reserved for another purpose, (2) the operating
system may use a different set of services for terminal I/O than file I/O.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
</ul>In summary, the Committee chose not to standardize the unbuffered I/O services
because:
<ul><li>They duplicate the facilities provided by the standard I/O services.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<li>The performance of the standard I/O services
	can be the same or better than the unbuffered I/O services.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<li>The unbuffered I/O file model may not be appropriate for many C language
	environments.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
</ul><h2><a name="4-9-1">4.9.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The macros
<code>_IOFBF</code>, <code>_IOLBF</code>, <code>_IONBF</code>
are enumerations of the third argument to <a name="setvbuf-4-9-1"><code>setvbuf</code></a>,
a function adopted from UNIX System V.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<code>SEEK_CUR</code>, <code>SEEK_END</code>, and <code>SEEK_SET</code>
have been moved to <a name="-60stdio-46h-62-4-9-1"><code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code></a>
from a header specified in the Base Document and not retained in the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<code>FOPEN_MAX</code>
and
<code>TMP_MAX</code>
are added environmental limits of some interest to
programs that manipulate multiple temporary files.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<a name="FILENAME-95MAX-4-9-1"><code>FILENAME_MAX</code></a> is provided so that buffers to hold file
names can be conveniently declared.  If the target system supports
arbitrarily long filenames, the implementor should provide some
reasonable value (80?, 255?, 509?) rather than something unusable
like <code>USHRT_MAX</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-2">4.9.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Streams</h2>
<p>
C inherited its notion of text <a name="streams-4-9-2">streams</a> from the <a name="UNIX-4-9-2">UNIX</a> environment
in which it was born.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Having each line delimited by a single <i>new-line</i> character,
regardless of the characteristics of the actual terminal,
supported a simple model of text
as a sort of arbitrary length scroll or ``galley.''&#160;<tt> </tt>
Having a channel that is ``transparent''&#160;<tt> </tt>
(no file structure or reserved data encodings)&#160;<tt> </tt>
eliminated the need for a distinction between text and binary streams.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Many other environments have different properties, however.&#160;<tt> </tt>
If a program written in C
is to produce a text file digestible by other programs,
by text editors in particular, it must conform to the text formatting
conventions of that environment.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The I/O facilities defined by the Standard are both more complex and more
restrictive than the ancestral I/O facilities of UNIX.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This is justified on pragmatic grounds:
most of the differences, restrictions and omissions exist to permit C I/O
implementations in environments which differ from the UNIX I/O
model.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Troublesome aspects of the stream concept include:
<p>
<dl><p>
<dt><b>The definition of lines.</b><dd>
In the UNIX model, division of
a file into lines is effected by new-line characters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Different techniques are used by other systems ---
lines may be separated by
CR-LF (carriage return, line feed) or
by unrecorded areas on the recording medium,
or each line may be prefixed by its length.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Standard
addresses this diversity by specifying that new-line be used as a line separator
at the program level, but then permitting an implementation to transform
the data read or written to conform to the conventions of the environment.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Some environments represent text lines 
as blank-filled fixed-length records.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus the Standard specifies that it is
<a name="implementation-defined-4-9-2"><i>implementation-defined</i></a>
whether 
trailing blanks are removed from a line on input.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(This specification also addresses the problems of environments which
represent text as variable-length records, but do not allow a record
length of 0: an empty line may be written as a one-character record
containing a blank, and the blank is stripped on input.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<dt><b>Transparency.</b><dd>
Some programs require access to external data without modification.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For instance, transformation of CR-LF to new-line character
is usually not desirable when object code is processed.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Standard
defines two stream types,
<i>text</i>
and <i>binary</i>,
to allow a program to define,
when a file is opened, whether the preservation of its exact contents
or of its line structure is more important in an environment which
cannot accurately reflect both.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<dt><b>Random access.</b><dd>
The UNIX I/O model features random access to data in a file,
indexed by character number.&#160;<tt> </tt>
On systems where a new-line character processed by the program
represents an unknown number of physically recorded characters,
this simple mechanism cannot be consistently supported for text streams.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Standard abstracts the significant properties of random access
for text streams: the ability
to determine the current file position and
then later reposition the file to the same location.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<a name="ftell-4-9-2"><code>ftell</code></a> returns a <a name="file-position-indicator"><i>file position indicator</i></a>,
which has no necessary interpretation except that an <a href="d9.html#fseek-4-9-9-2" name="fseek-4-9-2"><code>fseek</code></a>
operation with that indicator value will position the file to
the same place.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus an implementation may encode whatever file positioning
information is most appropriate for a text file,
subject only to the constraint that the encoding be representable
as a <code>long</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Use of <code>fgetpos</code> and <code>fsetpos</code> removes even this
constraint.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<dt><b>Buffering.</b><dd>
UNIX allows the program to control the
extent and type of buffering for various purposes.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For example,
a program can provide its own large I/O buffer to improve efficiency,
or can request unbuffered terminal I/O to process each input character
as it is entered.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Other systems do not necessarily support this generality.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Some systems provide only line-at-a-time access to terminal input;
some systems
support program-allocated buffers only by copying data to and from
system-allocated buffers for processing.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Buffering is addressed in the Standard by specifying UNIX-like
<a name="setbuf-4-9-2"><code>setbuf</code></a> and <a name="setvbuf-4-9-2"><code>setvbuf</code></a> functions,
but permitting great latitude in their implementation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
A conforming library need neither
attempt the impossible nor respond to a program attempt to improve
efficiency by introducing additional overhead.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
</dl><p>
Thus, the Standard imposes a clear distinction between <a name="text-streams"><i>text streams</i></a>,
which must be mapped to suit local custom, and
<a name="binary-streams"><i>binary streams</i></a>,
for which no mapping takes place.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Local custom on UNIX (and related) systems is of course
to treat the two sorts of streams identically, and
nothing in the Standard requires any changes to this practice.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Even the specification of binary streams requires some changes to
accommodate a wide range of systems.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Because many systems do not keep track of the length of a file to the nearest
byte, an arbitrary number of characters may appear on the end of a binary
stream directed to a file.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Standard cannot forbid this implementation, but does require
that this padding consist only of null characters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The alternative would be to restrict C to producing binary files digestible
only by other C programs;
this alternative runs counter to the
<i>spirit of C</i>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The set of characters required to be preserved in text stream
I/O are those needed for writing C programs;
the intent is the Standard should permit a C translator to be written
in a maximally portable fashion.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Control characters such as backspace are not required for this
purpose, so their handling in text streams is not mandated.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
It was agreed that some minimum maximum line length must be mandated;
254 was chosen.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-3">4.9.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Files</h2>
<p>
The <a name="as-if-4-9-3" href="b.html#as-if"><i>as if</i></a>
principle is once again invoked to define the nature of input and output
in terms of just two functions,
<a name="fgetc-4-9-3"><code>fgetc</code></a> and <a name="fputc-4-9-3"><code>fputc</code></a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The actual primitives in a given system may be quite different.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Buffering, and unbuffering, is defined in a way suggesting the
desired interactive behavior;
but an implementation may still be conforming even 
if delays (in a network or terminal controller) prevent
output from appearing in time.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It is the <i>intent</i> that matters here.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
No constraints are imposed upon file names, except that they must be
representable as strings (with no embedded null characters).&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-4">4.9.4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Operations on files</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-4-1">4.9.4.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="remove-4-9-4-1"><code>remove</code></a> function</h2>

<p>
The Base Document provides the <a name="unlink-4-9-4-1"><code>unlink</code></a>
system call to remove files.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The <a name="UNIX-4-9-4-1">UNIX</a>-specific definition of this function prompted
the Committee to replace it with a portable function.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-4-2">4.9.4.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="rename-4-9-4-2"><code>rename</code></a> function</h2>

<p>
This function has been added to provide
a system-independent atomic operation
to change the name of an existing file;
the Base Document only provided the <code>link</code> system call,
which gives the file a new name without removing the old one,
and which is extremely system-dependent.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Committee considered a proposal that <code>rename</code>
should quietly copy a file if simple
renaming couldn't be performed in some context,
but rejected this as potentially too expensive at execution time.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<code>rename</code> is meant to give access to an underlying facility of
the execution environment's operating system.&#160;<tt> </tt>
When the new name is the name of an existing file,
some systems allow the renaming
(and delete the old file or make it inaccessible by that name),
while others prohibit the operation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The effect of <code>rename</code> is thus <a name="implementation-defined-4-9-4-2"><i>implementation-defined</i></a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-4-3">4.9.4.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>tmpfile</code> function</h2>
<p>
The <a name="tmpfile-4-9-4-3"><code>tmpfile</code></a>
function is intended to allow users to create binary
``scratch'' files.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The <a name="as-if-4-9-4-3" href="b.html#as-if"><i>as if</i></a> principle implies that the information in such a file need
never actually be stored on a file-structured device.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The temporary file is created in binary update mode,
because it will presumably be first written and then
read as transparently as possible.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Trailing null-character padding may cause problems for some existing programs.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-4-4">4.9.4.4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="tmpnam-4-9-4-4"><code>tmpnam</code></a> function</h2>

<p>
This function allows for more control than <code>tmpfile</code>:
a file can be opened in binary mode or text mode,
and files are not erased at completion.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
There is always some time between the call to <code>tmpnam</code> and the use
(in <code>fopen</code>) of the returned name.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Hence it is conceivable that in some implementations
the name, which named no file at the call to <code>tmpnam</code>,
has been used as a filename by the time of the call to <code>fopen</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Implementations should devise name-generation strategies which minimize
this possibility, but users should allow for this possibility.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-5">4.9.5</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>File access functions</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-5-1">4.9.5.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>fclose</code> function</h2>
<p>
On some operating systems it is difficult, or impossible,
to create a file unless something is written to the file.&#160;<tt> </tt>
A maximally portable program which relies on a file being created
must write something to the associated stream before closing it.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-5-2">4.9.5.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>fflush</code> function</h2>
<p>
The <a name="fflush-4-9-5-2"><code>fflush</code></a> function ensures that output has been
forced out of internal I/O buffers for a specified stream.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Occasionally, however, it is necessary to ensure that <em> all</em>
output is forced out, and the programmer may not conveniently be
able to specify all the currently-open streams (perhaps because
some streams are manipulated within library packages).&#160;<tt> </tt>[Footnote:     For instance, on a system (such as <a name="UNIX-4-9-5-2">UNIX</a>) which supports
    process forks, it is usually necessary to flush all output buffers just
    prior to the fork.]&#160;<tt> </tt>
To provide an implementation-independent method of flushing all
output buffers, the Standard specifies that this is the result of
calling <code>fflush</code> with a NULL argument.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-5-3">4.9.5.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="fopen-4-9-5-3"><code>fopen</code></a> function</h2>

<p>
The <code>b</code> type modifier has been added to deal with the text/binary dichotomy
(see <a href="d9.html#4-9-2">&#167;4.9.2</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
Because of the limited ability to seek within text files (see <a href="d9.html#4-9-9-1">&#167;4.9.9.1</a>),
an implementation is at liberty to treat the old update
<code>+</code> modes as
if <code>b</code> were also specified.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Table 4.1 tabulates the capabilities and actions
associated with the various specified mode string arguments to
<code>fopen</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<pre>
                                          r   w   a   r+  w+  a+

</pre>
<ul><ul>
    Table 4.1:&#160;<tt> </tt>File and stream properties of <code>fopen</code> modes
</ul></ul>
Other specifications for files,
such as record length and block size,
are not specified in the Standard,
due to their widely varying characteristics in
different operating environments.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Changes to file access modes and buffer sizes may be specified using the
<a name="setvbuf-4-9-5-3"><code>setvbuf</code></a> function.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(See <a href="d9.html#4-9-5-6">&#167;4.9.5.6</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
An implementation may choose to allow additional file
specifications as part of the <code>mode</code> string argument.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For instance,
<pre>        file1 = fopen(file1name,&quot;wb,reclen=80&quot;);
</pre>might be a reasonable way,
on a system which provides record-oriented binary files,
for an implementation to allow a programmer to specify record length.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
A change of input/output direction on an update file
is only allowed following a
<a name="fsetpos-4-9-5-3"><code>fsetpos</code></a>,
<a href="d9.html#fseek-4-9-9-2" name="fseek-4-9-5-3"><code>fseek</code></a>,
<a name="rewind-4-9-5-3"><code>rewind</code></a>,
or <a name="fflush-4-9-5-3"><code>fflush</code></a> operation,
since these are precisely the functions
which assure that the I/O buffer has been flushed.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Standard (<a href="d9.html#4-9-2">&#167;4.9.2</a>) imposes the requirement that binary files
not be truncated when they are updated.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This rule does not preclude an implementation from supporting additional
file types that do truncate when written to,
even when they are opened with the same sort of <code>fopen</code> call.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Magnetic tape files are an example of a file type that must be
handled this way.  (On most tape hardware it is impossible to write
to a tape without destroying immediately following data.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
Hence tape files are not ``binary files'' within the meaning of
the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
A conforming hosted implementation must provide (and document) at
least one file type (on disk, most likely) that behaves exactly
as specified in the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-5-4">4.9.5.4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>freopen</code> function</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-5-5">4.9.5.5</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="setbuf-4-9-5-5"><code>setbuf</code></a> function</h2>
<p>
<code>setbuf</code> is subsumed by
<a name="setvbuf-4-9-5-5"><code>setvbuf</code></a>,
but has been retained for compatibility with old code.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-5-6">4.9.5.6</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="setvbuf-4-9-5-6"><code>setvbuf</code></a>
function</h2>
<p>
<code>setvbuf</code> has been adopted from UNIX System V,
both to control the nature of stream buffering
and to specify the size of I/O buffers.&#160;<tt> </tt>
An implementation is not required to make actual use of a buffer
provided for a stream,
so a program must never expect the buffer's contents to reflect I/O
operations.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Further, the Standard does not require that the requested buffering
be implemented;
it merely mandates a standard mechanism for requesting whatever buffering
services might be provided.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Although three types of buffering are defined,
an implementation may choose to make one or more of them equivalent.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For example, a library may choose
to implement line-buffering for binary files as equivalent to unbuffered I/O
or may choose to always implement full-buffering as equivalent to
line-buffering.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The general principle is to provide portable code with a means
of requesting the most appropriate popular buffering style,
but not to require an implementation to support these styles.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-6">4.9.6</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Formatted input/output functions</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="4-9-6-1">4.9.6.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>fprintf</code> function</h2>
<p>
Use of the <code>L</code> modifier with floating conversions has been added
to deal with formatted output of the new type <a name="long-double-4-9-6-1"><code>long double</code></a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Note that the <code>%X</code> and <code>%x</code> formats
expect a corresponding <code>int</code> argument;
<code>%lX</code> or <code>%lx</code> must be supplied with a <code>long int</code> argument.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The conversion specification <code>%p</code>
has been added for pointer conversion,
since the size of a pointer is not necessarily the same as the size of an
<code>int</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Because an implementation may support more than one size of pointer,
the corresponding argument is expected to be a
<a name="-40void--42-41-4-9-6-1"><code>(void *)</code></a> pointer.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The <code>%n</code> format has been added to permit ascertaining the number
of characters converted up to that point in the current invocation of the
formatter.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Some pre-Standard implementations switch formats for <code>%g</code>
at an exponent of <i>-</i>3 instead of (the Standard's) <i>-</i>4:
existing code which requires the format switch at <i>-</i>3 will
have to be changed.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Some existing implementations provide <code>%D</code> and <code>%O</code>
as synonyms or replacements for <code>%ld</code> and <code>%lo</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee considered the latter notation preferable.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Committee has reserved lower case conversion specifiers for future
standardization.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The use of leading zero in field widths to specify zero padding has been
superseded by a precision field.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The older mechanism has been retained.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Some implementations have provided the format <code>%r</code>

The functions <a name="vfprintf-4-9-6-1"><code>vfprintf</code></a>, etc.,
are considered to be a more controlled method of effecting this indirection,
so <code>%r</code> was not adopted in the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>

in an appropriate fashion.

<h2><a name="4-9-6-2">4.9.6.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="fscanf-4-9-6-2"><code>fscanf</code></a> function</h2>

The specification of <code>fscanf</code> is based in part on these principles:
<ul><li>As soon as one specified conversion fails,
	the whole function invocation fails.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<li>One-character pushback
	is sufficient for the implementation of <code>fscanf</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
	Given the invalid field ``<code>-.x</code>'', 
	the characters ``<code>-.</code>'' are not
	pushed back.
<p>
<li>If a ``flawed field'' is detected,
	no value is stored for the corresponding argument.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<li>The conversions performed by <code>fscanf</code> are compatible with
	those performed by <code>strtod</code> and <code>strtol</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul>Input pointer conversion with <code>%p</code> has been added,
although it is obviously risky, for symmetry with <code>fprintf</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The <code>%i</code> format
has been added to permit the scanner to determine the radix of the
number in the input stream;
the <code>%n</code> format
has been added to make available the number of characters
scanned thus far in the current invocation of the scanner.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
White space is now defined by the <a name="isspace-4-9-6-2"><code>isspace</code></a> function.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(See <a href="d3.html#4-3-1-9">&#167;4.3.1.9</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
An implementation must not use the <a name="ungetc-4-9-6-2"><code>ungetc</code></a> function
to perform the necessary one-character pushback.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In particular, since the unmatched text is left ``unread,''&#160;<tt> </tt>
the file position indicator as reported by the <code>ftell</code> function
must be the position of the character remaining to be read.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Furthermore, if the unread characters were themselves pushed back
via <code>ungetc</code> calls, the pushback in <code>fscanf</code> must not affect
the push-back stack in <code>ungetc</code>.  A <code>scanf</code> call that matches
N characters from a stream must leave the stream in the same state
as if N consecutive <code>getc</code> calls had been issued.&#160;<tt> </tt>

<h2><a name="4-9-7-11">4.9.7.11</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="ungetc-4-9-7-11"><code>ungetc</code></a> function</h2>

<p>
The Base Document requires that at least one character be read before
<code>ungetc</code> is called, in certain implementation-specific cases.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee has removed this requirement,
thus obliging a <a name="FILE-4-9-7-11"><code>FILE</code></a> structure
to have room to store one character of pushback regardless of the state
of the buffer;
it felt that this degree of generality makes clearer the ways
in which the function may be used.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
It is permissible to push back a different character than that which was read;
this accords with common existing practice.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The last-in, first-out nature of <code>ungetc</code> has been clarified.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

<code>ungetc</code> is typically used to handle algorithms, such as tokenization,
which involve one-character lookahead in text files.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<a href="d9.html#fseek-4-9-9-2"><code>fseek</code></a> and <code>ftell</code> are used for random access, typically in binary files.&#160;<tt> </tt>
So that these disparate file-handling disciplines are not unnecessarily linked,
the value of a text file's file position indicator immediately after <code>ungetc</code>
has been specified as indeterminate.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Existing practice relies on two different models of the effect of <code>ungetc</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
One model can be characterized as writing the pushed-back character
``on top of'' the previous character.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This model implies an implementation in which the pushed-back characters are
stored within the file buffer and bookkeeping is performed by
setting the file position indicator to the previous character position.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(Care must be taken in this model to recover the overwritten character
values when the pushed-back characters are discarded as a result of
other operations on the stream.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
The other model can be characterized as pushing the character ``between''&#160;<tt> </tt>
the current character and the previous character.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This implies an implementation in which the pushed-back characters
are specially buffered (within the FILE structure, say) and accounted
for by a flag or count.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In this model it is natural <i>not</i> to move the file position
indicator.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The indeterminacy of the file position indicator while pushed-back
characters exist accommodates both models.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Mandating either model
(by specifying the effect of <code>ungetc</code> on 
a text file's file position indicator)&#160;<tt> </tt>
creates problems with implementations that have assumed the other model.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Requiring the file position indicator not to change after <code>ungetc</code>
would necessitate changes in programs which combine random access
and tokenization on text files,
and rely on the file position indicator marking the end of a token
even after pushback.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Requiring the file position indicator to back up would create severe
implementation problems in certain environments,
since in some file organizations it can be impossible to find the previous
input character position without having read the file sequentially to
the point in question.&#160;<tt> </tt>[Footnote: 
Consider, for instance, a sequential file of variable-length records in which
a line is represented as a count field followed by the characters in the line.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The file position indicator must encode a character position
as the position of the count field plus an offset into the line;
from the position of the count field and the length of the line,
the next count field can be found.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Insufficient information is available for finding the <i>previous</i>
count field, so backing up from the first character of a line necessitates,
in the general case, a sequential read from the start of the file.]&#160;<tt> </tt>

<h2><a name="4-9-9-2">4.9.9.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <a name="fseek-4-9-9-2"><code>fseek</code></a> function</h2>

<p>
Whereas a binary file can be treated as an ordered sequence of bytes,
counting from zero, a text file need not map one-to-one to its
internal representation (see <a href="d9.html#4-9-2">&#167;4.9.2</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus, only seeks to an earlier reported position are permitted for
text files.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The need to encode both record position and position within a record
in a <code>long</code> value may constrain the size of text files
upon which <code>fseek</code>-<code>ftell</code> can be used
to be considerably smaller than the size of binary files.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Given these restrictions,
the Committee still felt that this function has enough utility,
and is used in sufficient existing code,
to warrant its retention in the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<code>fgetpos</code> and <code>fsetpos</code> have been added to deal with files
which are too large to handle with <code>fseek</code> and <code>ftell</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
