<p>
<h2><a name="3-7-1">3.7.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Function definitions</h2>
<p>
A <a name="function-definition"><i>function definition</i></a> may have its old form
(and say nothing about arguments on calls),
or it may be introduced by a <a name="prototype"><i>prototype</i></a>
(which affects argument checking and coercion on subsequent calls).&#160;<tt> </tt>
(See also <a href="c1.html#3-1-2-2">&#167;3.1.2.2</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

To avoid a nasty ambiguity,
the Standard bans the use of <code>typedef</code> names as formal parameters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For instance, in translating the text
<pre>        int f(size_t, a_t, b_t, c_t, d_t, e_t, f_t, g_t,
              h_t, i_t, j_t, k_t, l_t, m_t, n_t, o_t,
              p_t, q_t, r_t, s_t)
</pre>the translator determines that the construct can only be a prototype declaration
as soon as it scans the first <code>size_t</code> and following comma.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In the absence of this rule, it might be necessary to see
the token following the
right parenthesis that closes the parameter list,
which would require a sizeable look-ahead,
before deciding whether the text under scrutiny is a prototype declaration
or an old-style function header definition.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

An argument list must be explicitly present in the declarator;
it cannot be inherited from a <a name="typedef-3-7-1"><code>typedef</code></a> (see <a href="c5.html#3-5-4-3">&#167;3.5.4.3</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
That is to say, given the definition
<pre>        typedef int p(int q, int r);
</pre>the following fragment is invalid:
<pre>        p funk 			/* weird */
        { return q + r ; }
</pre><p>

Some current implementations rewrite the type of a
(for instance)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<code>char</code> parameter as if it were declared <code>int</code>,
since the argument is known to be passed as an <code>int</code>
(in the absence of prototypes).&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Standard requires, however, that the received argument be converted
<a name="as-if"><i>as if</i></a> by assignment upon function entry.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Type rewriting is thus no longer permissible.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<ul><ul><ul><ul><b>QUIET CHANGE</b><p></ul></ul></ul>Functions that depend on <code>char</code> or <code>short</code>
parameter types being widened to <code>int</code>,
or <code>float</code> to <code>double</code>, may behave differently.&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul>
Notes for implementors:
the assignment conversion for argument passing
often requires no executable code.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In most twos-complement machines, a <code>short</code> or <code>char</code>
is a contiguous subset of the bytes comprising the <code>int</code>
actually passed (for even the most unusual byte orderings),
so that assignment conversion can be
effected by adjusting the address of the
argument (if necessary) .&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
For an argument declared <code>float</code>, however,
an explicit conversion must usually be performed from the
<code>double</code> actually passed to the <code>float</code> desired.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Not many implementations can subset the bytes of a <code>double</code>
to get a <code>float</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(Even those that apparently permit simple truncation often get the wrong
answer on certain negative numbers.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

Some current implementations permit an argument to be masked by a declaration
of the same identifier in the outermost block of a function.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This usage is almost always an erroneous attempt
by a novice C programmer to declare the argument;
it is rarely the result of a deliberate attempt to render the argument
unreachable.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee decided, therefore,
that arguments are effectively declared in the outermost block,
and hence cannot be quietly redeclared in that block.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

The Committee considered it important
that a function taking a variable number of arguments,
such as <code>printf</code>,
be expressible portably in C.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Hence, the Committee devoted much time to exploring methods of traversing
variable argument lists.&#160;<tt> </tt>
One proposal was to require arguments to be passed as a
``brick''&#160;<tt> </tt>
(i.e., a contiguous area of memory),
the layout of which would be sufficiently well specified
that a portable method of traversing the brick could be determined.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Several diverse implementations,
however,
can implement argument passing more efficiently if the arguments
are not required to be contiguous.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus, the Committee decided to hide the implementation details
of determining the location of successive elements of an argument list
behind a standard set of macros (see <a href="d8.html#4-8">&#167;4.8</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
