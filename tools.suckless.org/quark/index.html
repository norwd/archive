<p>quark is an extremely small and simple HTTP GET/HEAD-only web server for static
content.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to do one thing and do it well, namely serving
static web directories and doing that right. Most other solutions either are
too complex (CGI support, dependencies on external libraries, ...) or lack
features you expect (TLS, virtual hosts, partial content, not modified since,
...). quark tries to find a midway and just restrict itself to being static
while still offering functions you only find in more bloated solutions and
being as secure as possible (chroot, privilege dropping, strict parsers, no
malloc at runtime, pledge, unveil, ...).</p>
<h2>Static web</h2>
<p>We believe that most of the web does not need to be dynamic and increasing
complexity on server-side applications is one of the main reasons for the web
obesity crisis. The common approach nowadays is to do everything on the server,
including parsing requests, modifying files and databases, generating HTML and
all that using unfit languages like PHP or JavaScript, which is a security and
efficiency nightmare.</p>
<p>Over the years we have seen massive amounts of security holes in numerous
applications of tools commonly used for these jobs (PHP, node.js,
CGI-implementations, ...). The reason why we are in this situation in the first
place is due to the fact that the jobs of data processing and data
presentation, which should be separate, converged together into one.</p>
<p>The solution is to rely on static regeneration independent from the web server,
which just serves static files. You can still implement e.g. form handlers for
dynamic content which run as their own network instance and operate
independently from the web server. What's left is just to generate the static
content using the database and repeating this process in case the database is
updated.</p>
<p>This way the jobs of data processing and data presentation are separate again,
with many advantages. All requests are handled with constantly low latency,
with the possibility of serving everything directly from RAM (using a ramfs).
Separated concerns make it very unattractive to attack the web server itself
and the attack surface that is left, if it is present at all, is the separate
form handler, which can be implemented in a very simple, safe and efficient
manner.</p>
<p>In case there is an attack on this infrastructure and the attacker manages to
DoS the form handler, the serving of content is still unaffected.</p>
<h2>TLS-support</h2>
<p>quark does not natively support TLS. A more suckless approach than to
implement TLS into it is to use a TLS reverse proxy (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/tlstunnel">tlstunnel</a>,
<a href="https://hitch-tls.org/">hitch</a> or <a href="https://www.stunnel.org/">stunnel</a>).
It accepts encrypted TLS connections and forwards them as unencrypted
requests to a server. In this case, one can run such a reverse proxy to listen
on a public IP address and forward the requests to a local port or UNIX-domain socket.</p>
