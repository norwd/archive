(\u201cMIRI\u201d) has adopted this Privacy Policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) to provide you, the user of hpmor.com (the \u201cWebsite\u201d), with information about how the Website collects and uses certain information it collects when you use the Website. MIRI values your privacy and has adopted this policy in an effort to remain transparent with respect to its collection of this information.<\/p>\n<h3>Email Privacy<\/h3>\n<p>MIRI does not provide, sell, or rent email addresses to anyone outside the organization.<\/p>\n<h3>What Information Does MIRI Collect?<\/h3>\n<p>As with most website operators, MIRI collects and maintains personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) about individual consumers collected online from those individuals. For the majority of our users, we obtain a minimal amount of PII including, but not limited to, IP addresses, geolocation data, pixel tags, web beacons, Website pages accessed, and your use of the Website. We collect this information so that we may better diagnose problems with our server, administer the Website, and build statistical metrics used to track Website visitor traffic. MIRI may, however, collect additional PII depending on what you voluntarily provide to us. For instance, MIRI offers certain services and methods of interacting with the Website which may require you to voluntarily submit additional information, such as your email address.<\/p>\n<h3>How Your Information May Be Used<\/h3>\n<p>As stated above, MIRI\u2019s collection of PII is premised on helping you enjoy a better user experience. MIRI obtains PII from its users in order to diagnose problems and properly administer the Website and its services. MIRI does not provide, sell, or rent your PII to anyone outside the organization, except as provided in this Privacy Policy. The Website also uses \u201ccookie\u201d messages to automatically help provide better services. A cookie may be placed in your computer so that when you visit the Website again, we can remember your preferences based on the information you provided before. Cookies allow us to track your usage of the Website so we know which aspects of our Website are the most popular. You can reject cookies or cancel them by changing your web browser settings accordingly. Although MIRI does not sell or rent your PII to third parties, MIRI may share your PII with third parties to provide the services offered through the Website. Additionally, MIRI may share your PII with its company parents or subsidiaries or to a third party in a sale of MIRI or the Website. MIRI may also share or otherwise use your PII to respond to a duly authorized subpoena or court order, to respond to regulatory requests by government authorities, or where we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to protect the safety, security, and\/or reputation of MIRI, the Website, its employees, officers, agents, board of directors, investors, and\/or its users, including as part of investigations, or in litigation, and, where necessary, to prevent fraud, false advertising, death, imminent bodily harm, or the violation of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or treaty, whether local, state, provincial, national, or international.<\/p>\n<h3>How is My Information Secured?<\/h3>\n<p>MIRI works to protect the security of your PII and, to the best of its ability, has implemented industry standard encryption to protect against unauthorized access to, or interception of, your PII. MIRI makes no guarantee or warranty regarding the continued uptime of its encryption measures, but will use its best efforts to maintain and if necessary restore such measures.<\/p>\n<h3>How Do I Cease MIRI\u2019s Collection and\/or Use of My Information?<\/h3>\n<p>You may cease MIRI\u2019s collection and\/or use of your PII by discontinuing your use of the Website, and adjusting your web browser settings to clear any cookies remaining on your computer from your prior use of the Website. You may also unsubscribe from any of our services by notifying us.<\/p>\n<h3>Online Tracking and California Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) Disclosures<\/h3>\n<p>MIRI neither tracks nor collects PII from your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. As that is the case, MIRI does not respond to a browser\u2019s DNT signal. The Website may host embedded third-party content, such as a social media feature, that may set cookies on your browser and\/or obtain information about the fact that you visited a specific MIRI website from a certain IP address. Any PII obtained in this fashion, however, is that which is voluntarily provided by you to the third party.<\/p>\n<h3>Notices and Privacy Concerns<\/h3>\n<p>All notices to MIRI pursuant to this Privacy Policy may be made in writing to our customer service department at privacy@intelligence.org in writing. You may also contact privacy@intelligence.org with any questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy and our privacy practices.<\/p>\n<h2>Content<\/h2>\n<h3>Website Content<\/h3>\n<p>MIRI has made every attempt to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information provided on the Website.
