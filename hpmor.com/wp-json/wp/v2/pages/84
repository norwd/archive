I already put three years into it, so if I quit now, those three years will have been wasted!&#8221; that&#8217;s sunk-cost reasoning; the three years are already spent and won&#8217;t be gotten back either way. \u00a0Conversely, if you say, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s worth one more year to finish my PhD program &#8211; I looked up salaries and people in my profession with PhDs get substantially higher salaries on average&#8221; &#8211; leaving aside that this is somewhat improbable in many fields &#8211; then you&#8217;re reasoning as a proper consequentialist, attending to <em>future<\/em>\u00a0consequences and the future\u00a0costs required to obtain future benefits.<\/p>\n<p>The sunk cost fallacy is\u00a0one among many, many known cognitive biases, and one that happens to have received a lot of press. \u00a0But we (the people behind CFAR) have encountered several friends with this <em>exact<\/em>\u00a0problem (whether to finish a PhD) who seemed\u00a0<em>highly<\/em>\u00a0attached to the costs they&#8217;d previously sunk, and had to be argued out of this sort of reasoning at some length. \u00a0These are people who, like us, have a strong interest in cognitive biases, decision theory, and correct reasoning &#8211; but although they <em>knew<\/em>\u00a0about the sunk cost fallacy, they&#8217;d never <em>practiced<\/em>\u00a0overcoming it or <em>trained<\/em>\u00a0themselves to overcome it, and so when they ran into the real-life situation, they fell prey to the usual mistake.<\/p>\n<p>We think it&#8217;s possible to teach modern rationality (i.e., modern-cognitive-science-based principles for saner thinking) to a <em>much<\/em>\u00a0higher standard than is attempted by present-day &#8220;critical thinking&#8221; programs at colleges, corporate seminars on productivity&#8230; or even the <em>lectures<\/em>\u00a0and <em>knowledge<\/em>\u00a0embedded in modern cognitive science books, which might tell you what&#8217;s wrong, but rarely give you training techniques and exercises you can use to fix yourself.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve accumulated large quantities of admittedly anecdotal evidence that people who learn about <em>many<\/em>\u00a0cognitive biases and train themselves to overcome them, become substantially smarter in their everyday lives &#8211; among the cases we know, they&#8217;ve negotiated higher salaries, changed fields, gotten out of bad relationships and into good ones, lost weight, and learned to stop doing things that make themselves miserable. \u00a0In some cases, they&#8217;ve abandoned long-held superstitions with much less fuss and mess than it usually seems to take.<\/p>\n<p>(Randomized tests of this sort of intervention are currently underway, but the life-outcome measurements aren&#8217;t in yet.)<\/p>\n<p>We want to systematize the practice of applied rationality, and reliably produce people who can reliably execute the skills of evidence-based sanity &#8211; what we&#8217;ve seen so far, we believe, is just the tip of the iceberg of what can be accomplished. \u00a0It&#8217;s worth noting that the whole &#8220;Enlightenment&#8221; business of the last several centuries began from greater use of the empirical method, arithmetic-based engineering, and similar <em>cognitive improvements<\/em>. \u00a0But that journey is far from over &#8211; humanity now has the next collection of recently discovered errors, so now it&#8217;s time to fix those too, and keep the project going.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Wanted: \u00a0Test subjects, workshop attendees, and funding.<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>We are looking for test subjects on which to try out new exercises as we imagine them. \u00a0People who live in the Bay Area are especially desired for in-person tests. \u00a0We definitely want as many of you as possible, <em>especially<\/em>\u00a0if you&#8217;ve had little previous exposure to the science of cognitive biases. \u00a0<strong>We will never have too many test subjects.<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0If you live near enough Berkeley to get there by BART on a Saturday or two, or if you&#8217;re interested in Internet-based testing, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheet\/viewform?formkey=dDhnS1RaNWc0NGFiZEY2ZVV2NjgyRHc6MA\">please sign up<\/a><em>.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Center for Applied Rationality runs occasional\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/appliedrationality.org\/workshops\/\">workshops<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0where people get a coherent package of skills presented in an organized way, with lots of practice and followup afterwards. \u00a0Many attendees report this as a peak experience and say that it helped their lives a <em>lot.<\/em>\u00a0 The current workshops are aimed at people who can get a lot of value out of them (especially entrepreneurs, hackers, and other ambitious+analytic folk) and priced accordingly, but scholarships are occcasionally available. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/appliedrationality.org\/workshops\/\">Apply here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, <strong>the Center for Applied Rationality needs\u00a0<em>funding<\/em> to keep doing all that amazing stuff<\/strong>. \u00a0I (Eliezer Yudkowsky aka Less Wrong) am not employed by the Center for Applied Rationality, and I don&#8217;t currently receive (or need) any funding from CFAR. \u00a0But I consider it <em>absolutely<\/em>\u00a0<em>vital<\/em> and a\u00a0<strong><em>top priority for the human species<\/em><\/strong> that this project of turning cognitive science into practical sane behavior, continue forward at the fastest possible rate with the best possible people. \u00a0It could help determine how sane of a planet we live on, in a few years, in a couple of decades. \u00a0CFAR is currently in a critical startup phase. \u00a0<strong><em>Please<\/em> <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/appliedrationality.org\/donate\/\"><strong>help CFAR out<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Center for Applied Rationality\u00a0is a\u00a0new nonprofit seeking to invent new ways to teach science-based rationality skills, for overcoming cognitive biases and thinking sanely using a human brain.
