how probability theory behaves in the presence of an &#8220;impossible&#8221; observation. \u00a0(For non-mathy readers, a huge rewrite of that document is currently underway which should make it much more easily accessible.) \u00a0In Harry&#8217;s &#8220;You turned into a cat!&#8221;

it&#8217;s not just a matter of not knowing any particular force that violates it; we have reason to believe that <em>no<\/em>\u00a0force should violate it. \u00a0And for the benefit of any second-grade math teachers out there,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/math\/algebra\/logarithms\/v\/introduction-to-logarithms\">LOGARITHMS<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Ch. 3: \u00a0&#8220;Comparing Reality to Its Alternatives&#8221; is the title of a paper by Kahneman and Dale Miller, describing (among other things) how people sometimes try to understand the real world by comparing it to something else, like an ideal perfect situation. \u00a0A more directly on-topic paper would&#8217;ve been Miller&#8217;s &#8220;Counterfactual thought, regret, and superstition: \u00a0How to avoid kicking yourself&#8221;

two years of blog posts that tried to introduce just about everything that I thought a rationalist needed to know as of 2007, starting with basic theory of knowledge, Bayesian probability theory, cognitive biases, evolutionary psychology, social psychology, and going on into the more arcane realms of reductionism and demystified quantum mechanics. \u00a0Believe it or not, Harry is only allowed to draw on around half of the easier Sequences &#8211;
