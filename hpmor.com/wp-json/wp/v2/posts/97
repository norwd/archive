But work continues with a paragraph now and then, and I recently realized that the structural problem with Ch. 78 might be solvable by splitting off a prelude from it. The fic has not been abandoned &#8211; I haven&#8217;t even gotten to the good parts yet!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 12\/25:<\/strong> Decided\u00a0<em>not<\/em>\u00a0to split 78. It&#8217;s finished at &gt;17,000 words, but I want to finish at least Ch. 79 before publishing anything, because 78 ends on a major cliffhanger. On the plus side, I\u00a0<em>think<\/em>\u00a0the end of Ch. 78 gets us back into the main flow of action again. All of this has taught me a valuable lesson about writing structure, &#8220;never recurse more than once&#8221; &#8211; you can have X happen so that Y can happen, but never have W happen so that X can happen so that Y can happen. Anything worth setting up can be set up in one step.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 12\/28:<\/strong> Ch. 79 done at 6,700 words. I think I&#8217;ll see if I can get this entire arc done before I start posting it &#8211; if not, I&#8217;ll give up and post before\u00a0<em>too<\/em>\u00a0long, but I&#8217;m encouraged by how fast Ch. 79 went.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 1\/19:<\/strong> Currently working on Ch. 81. I may or may not post 78 when I&#8217;m done with 81, but have a strong impression that I had better at least complete Ch. 81 before posting anything. This is due both to the extent that the chapters form a dramatic &#8216;block&#8217; and the number of backward edits I&#8217;ve been making.<\/p>\n<p>I am surprised at the number of people who assume that I am deliberately squatting on these chapters like some sort of evil hoardy dragon bent on causing them personal pain, despite the fact that I am, y&#8217;know, nice enough to write the chapters in the first place. Those sorts of yelling, impolite, demanding reviews &#8211; you know who you are &#8211; don&#8217;t make writing more pleasant for me. General life advice: Celeste&#8217;s Principle states that you should try to associate a behavior with pleasant, positive, rewarding feelings if you want that behavior to be repeated. Demanding that I release chapters isn&#8217;t going to make me stop writing, but it does feel like a small jolt of pain each time I get one and that&#8217;s really not what you want me to associate with HPMOR. That&#8217;s not blackmail, it&#8217;s me genuinely describing how my mind works.<\/p>\n<p>Writing lessons recently learned:<\/p>\n<p>(1) Next time, if ever, that I write a novel, I will know that the reason there is a phrase called &#8220;plot bunnies&#8221; is that they\u00a0<em>reproduce out of control<\/em>\u00a0if not otherwise restrained, and I will try to put my plot open parens closer to my plot close parens.<\/p>\n<p>(2) Thinking abstractly about the degree of\u00a0<em>tension<\/em>\u00a0that needs to hold in a particular place in the text, was very helpful in letting me see which events\u00a0<em>couldn&#8217;t<\/em>\u00a0happen, or needed to happen at a later point. For example, you can&#8217;t have a joke, or certain kinds of jokes, while you&#8217;re trying to build tension &#8211; laughter dissipates tension.<\/p>\n<p>(3) If you&#8217;re a fanfiction author and have completed chapters in the pipeline but you&#8217;re still working on them or want to post them as a set, don&#8217;t tell anyone unless you&#8217;re very thick-skinned &#8211; there&#8217;s a surprisingly large number of vocal readers who will take this as a personal insult, even though many others may be glad for the information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 1\/20:<\/strong>\u00a0 I am amazed at the incredible outpouring of warmth that I&#8217;ve gotten over the last two days. Thank you.\u00a0<em>This<\/em>\u00a0is what makes writing rewarding. I will take all your kind words to heart, and not post the arc until it&#8217;s properly cooked and finished and ready for a flurry of predictable closely-spaced posts. That&#8217;s what I thought most people would want after waiting several months, and the recent flood of reassurance has given me the strength to carry through on it.<\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s HPMOR words written: 3,800.<br \/>\nLatest chapter with a complete draft: Ch. 81.<br \/>\nHours past bedtime stayed up before even\u00a0<em>starting<\/em>\u00a0to go to sleep: 1.5.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 2\/7:<\/strong> \u00a0Currently 4,800 words into Ch. 83, the Aftermath (final chapter) of the next story sequence.<\/p>\n<p>You may also have noted that Fanfiction.Net has disabled links in all author profile pages. \u00a0As a result I&#8217;ve moved the entire content of the author&#8217;s profile to HPMOR.com, and am seriously considering making it the primary version with FF.net as the mirror.<\/p>\n<p>You can also hit the front page of HPMOR.com to simultaneously check the latest chapter and latest Note.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 2\/10:<\/strong> \u00a05,800 words into Ch. 83. \u00a0If you&#8217;re wondering why this has been going slower lately, one reason is that I&#8217;ve been putting a lot of effort into starting a new nonprofit organization that will invent, test, and propagate systematic exercises for improving human sanity. \u00a0E.g., not just, &#8220;here is the sunk cost fallacy&#8221;, but &#8220;here are exercises meant to make sure that your brain recognizes sunk costs in real life and chains into three techniques for detaching from them&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re currently hiring people to help invent (and write and test) these exercises. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/lesswrong.com\/lw\/9hb\/position_design_and_write_rationality_curriculum\/\">Apply here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheet\/viewform?formkey=dEFJQXd6S1M4V3duS2podVR5dXdzRlE6MQ\">We need people\u00a0to help test versions of these exercises as they are being developed.<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0 We actively\u00a0prefer\u00a0people who have\u00a0<em>not<\/em>\u00a0read through the Sequences on LessWrong.com, since we&#8217;re trying to develop exercises for fresh audiences. \u00a0We especially need you\u00a0if you&#8217;re in the Bay Area and willing to spend three hours on a Saturday afternoon being a test subject. \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheet\/viewform?formkey=dEFJQXd6S1M4V3duS2podVR5dXdzRlE6MQ\">Sign up here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 2\/28:<\/strong> 8200 words into the final chapter of the next sequence.
