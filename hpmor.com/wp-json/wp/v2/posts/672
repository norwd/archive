than all that other stuff. \u00a0Sometimes I don&#8217;t really understand why so few people try to get involved in the Plot. \u00a0But if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned in life, it&#8217;s that the important things are accomplished not by those best suited to do them, or by those who ought to be responsible for doing them, but by whoever actually shows up.<\/p>\n<p>The next <strong>Progress Report<\/strong> (not a story update, a report on writing progress) will appear on <strong>Jan 1st, 2014<\/strong> at <strong>5PM Pacific Time<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So &#8211;
