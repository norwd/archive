\u00a0I do\u00a0<em>like<\/em>\u00a0the Self-Actualization arc, but&#8230; \u00a0Lesson learned: \u00a0<em>Any setup you think you need to accomplish by a major diversionary arc can probably also be accomplished by a single event, if you can find that single event.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>2) \u00a0<em>Anything you think will be completely inexplicable to the readers, probably won&#8217;t be<\/em>\u00a0&#8211; they know less background info than you, so where you see a single huge missing fact you haven&#8217;t yet revealed, they see a plentiful bag of possible interpretations. \u00a0(Discovered when I compared all the reviewers&#8217; interpretations of the Wham Line at the end of 78, to the actual interpretation revealed in 79.) \u00a0An important corollary is that anything you think <em>won&#8217;t<\/em> confuse the readers, <em>will<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>3)<span style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;\">\u00a0 The description of the breaking storm over Hogwarts at the end of Ch. 78 probably did more to make the Wham Line &#8220;fit&#8221; than the whole previous Self-Actualization arc.<\/span>\u00a0\u00a0<em>Setup you think needs to be accomplished by plot events, can also just be done by atmosphere and tension in the immediate paragraphs; but this won&#8217;t be obvious when you&#8217;re trying to outline the abstract plot.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>All of these are corollaries to the key lesson I&#8217;m learning as a writer &#8211; for yes, this is my first real book-length effort, and I am very much still learning &#8211; <em>never divert.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Among the several people who suffered so that you could get your next Methods fix is Shannon Friedman (Chaotic Shannon in Ch. 78), who missed several dates with me so that I could get some writing done. \u00a0She&#8217;s starting up a counseling business, specializing in Internal Family Systems work &#8211; if she was talking to Harry,\u00a0she&#8217;d try to talk to his Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Internal Critic, and dark side separately, find out what they wanted, and try to negotiate a compromise that all of Harry&#8217;s parts could agree on. \u00a0(A chunk of our rationalist community, though by no means unanimously, have been evangelizing Internal Family Systems as the most effective type of counseling they&#8217;ve come across so far.) \u00a0Shannon is currently looking for new counseling clients; she&#8217;s located in the Bay Area (Mountain View) but can also do Skype video, and is charging HPMOR readers an introductory rate of $50\/hour. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/positivevector.com\/shannon-friedman\/\">Click here for more<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Quixey is a startup founded by LW readers, with a fair number of HPMOR-reading employees.\u00a0 They have funding and traction, are looking for top programmers, and are offering salaries competitive with what you&#8217;d get at Google.\u00a0 One year out of college is fine, if you&#8217;ve got the talent and you&#8217;re a good fit for their culture.\u00a0 To publicize their hiring efforts, they&#8217;re also running the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quixeychallenge.com\/?ref=EliezerYudkowsky\">Quixey Challenge<\/a> &#8211; if you&#8217;re in CS at CMU or MIT, you&#8217;ve probably already heard of this &#8211; which offers $100 to anyone (in the US) who can solve a programming challenge in one minute or less. \u00a0The next Quixey Challenge is Wednesday, March 21st. \u00a0If you&#8217;re a superprogrammer, and especially if you&#8217;re interested in working for a Bay Area company with a strong rationalist culture and highly competitive salaries, give it a shot!\u00a0 And if you get to the interview stage, be sure to tell them how you got there.<\/p>\n<p>Public service announcement: \u00a0If you have high talent, programming is <em>extremely<\/em>\u00a0easy to learn. \u00a0The way I became a programmer was by finding an old ZX81 computer with 4K of RAM and no tape drive, meaning that anytime you wanted to use a program you had to type it in from scratch, and pretty soon I was typing in my own programs. \u00a0This was at the age of 5 or 6. \u00a0This mysterious Talent doesn&#8217;t always correlate to intelligence, but if you did well at algebra and you&#8217;re currently making less than $120,000\/year, consider installing Python 3, looking at some random Python programs online, and then seeing if you can write programs yourself. College majors are a highly inefficient market, with Computer Science enrollments steadily\u00a0<em>dropping<\/em>, and competent programmers are in <em>extreme<\/em>\u00a0demand right now &#8211; in the Bay Area, companies are paying $10-$20,000 for\u00a0successful <em>referrals.<\/em>\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t require a four-year education to start getting paid to do this &#8211; if you&#8217;ve got enough Talent to learn to program just by reading code, then regardless of what other career you&#8217;ve built or costs you&#8217;ve sunk, you should definitely try your hand as a modern-day wizard. \u00a0This concludes the public service announcement.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>And now, the long-awaited fanart update!<\/p>\n<p>Audiovisual: \u00a0Centreoftheselights sings<strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/9gxYYw_NO9M\">her original Chaos Legion Song<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0on Youtube, and cameos as Ellie Knight in Ch. 78.<\/p>\n<p>Drawn: \u00a0Cover art\u00a0by <a href=\"http:\/\/mike-obee-lay.deviantart.com\/art\/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality-Cover-280590525\">Mike Obee Lay<\/a> (cameo pending). \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/wishcat.deviantart.com\/art\/Something-Precious-278123245\">Wishcat<\/a> brings us a view of Rianne Felthorne from Ch. 76 &#8211;
