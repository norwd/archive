may be, or even what we&#8217;re trying to impact&#8212;are we trying to help modern-day humans? do animals also count? do we really care most about the much larger number of people who will exist in a larger future? \u00a0But we share\u00a0a common interest, and a common way of looking at the world,\u00a0since we agree that maximizing impact per dollar is at least the correct question to ask; and that we are allowed to be calculating about it. \u00a0I am honored to count as fellow travelers all effective altruists who ask that\u00a0right\u00a0question, even if we arrive at different conclusions for the moment; and I feel a warm sensation in my heart whenever I hear about someone who got involved with effective altruism through a pathway that included HPMOR.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Fan art:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Saiida:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/saiida.deviantart.com\/art\/Facets-467887721\">Facets<\/a><\/li>\n<li>laughingmad:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/laughingmad.tumblr.com\/post\/85751745299\/i-made-the-chaos-legion-pendant-i-designed-a-while\">Chaos Legion Pendant<\/a><\/li>\n<li>etherpendant:\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/etherpendant.deviantart.com\/art\/HPMOR-Unicorn-Eater-457792397\">Unicorn Eater<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>e.b.:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bNPbrsm.jpg\">Fan Cover<\/a>\u00a0(cover)<\/li>\n<li>Rufus Scridgemore:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/rufusscridgemore.deviantart.com\/art\/The-Perfect-Crime-420892932\">The Perfect Crime<\/a><\/li>\n<li>mokkurkalfe:\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/mokkurkalfe.deviantart.com\/art\/HPMOR-Aint-I-A-Stinker-464540117\">Ain&#8217;t I a Stinker?<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>AndIMoveSmilingly:\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/andimovesmilingly.deviantart.com\/art\/In-Azkaban-442642431\">In Azkaban<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Arahneed:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/arahneed.deviantart.com\/art\/Keep-calm-and-Rationality-436666899\">Keep Calm and Rationality<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Annie A MC:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/annieamc.deviantart.com\/art\/Image-421334610\">Death Is My Enemy<\/a><\/li>\n<li>TRURURU-Matthew:\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/trururu-matthew.deviantart.com\/art\/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality-421155414\">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>yaolilylu:\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/imgur.com\/9hebTKl\">Stars<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Lanthanum:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/mirihpmor.wpengine.com\/?attachment_id=749%20\">All the lights in the sky are nuclear fusion<\/a>\u00a0+\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/mirihpmor.wpengine.com\/?attachment_id=750%20\">Super Galaxy Patronus<\/a>\u00a0(these form a temporal sequence, read in order)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(Reminder: \u00a0HPMOR is now out of room for new cameos. \u00a0I will let fan artists know if this changes.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recursive fanfictions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Superdupervenience:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/superdupervenience.tumblr.com\/post\/92865230741\/one-level-deeper\">One Level Deeper<\/a>\u00a0(Harry\/Quirrell Occlumency lessons, pre-slash, the author and several of her\/my\u00a0friends claim\u00a0this pairing is already canon and that I am blind to the subtext of my own writing)<\/li>\n<li>alexanderwales:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/m.fanfiction.net\/s\/10023949\/1\/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie\">Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#8217;s Zombie<\/a>\u00a0(ghost!Hermione, continues Ch. 89)<\/li>\n<li>75th:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fanfiction.net\/s\/10521956\/1\/Proximity\">Proximity<\/a>\u00a0(continues Ch. 85)<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #545454;\">writingathingin<\/span>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1YcLaTIbu9C5fxGJkSpBe8eSEDwVHp7Twth-rn7RvEXU\/edit\">Of Fakes, Phoenixes, and Friendship<\/a>\u00a0(continues Ch. 89, crack)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Most awesome things I have read since Ch. 101 posted:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong style=\"color: #1982d1;\"><a style=\"color: #1982d1;\" href=\"http:\/\/qntm.org\/ra\">Ra by qntm<\/a>,<\/strong><span style=\"color: #373737;\">\u00a0for everyone who keeps saying, &#8220;I liked the part where Harry was trying to figure out the laws of magic, can\u2019t you just get back to that instead of having all this plot?&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a style=\"color: #1982d1;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fanfiction.net\/s\/7231695\/1\/Carpetbaggers\">Carpetbaggers\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"color: #373737;\">by cofax, which addresses the question of what\u00a0Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edward did as\u00a0Kings and Queens of Narnia.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong style=\"color: #373737;\"><a style=\"color: #1982d1;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fanfiction.net\/u\/4976703\/alexanderwales\">Alexanderwales<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0is turning into an impressive and\u00a0prolific rationalfic writer. \u00a0See especially\u00a0<a style=\"color: #1982d1;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fanfiction.net\/s\/10360716\/1\/The-Metropolitan-Man\">Metropolitan Man <\/a>and<span style=\"color: #373737;\">\u00a0<a style=\"color: #1982d1;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fanfiction.net\/s\/9915682\/1\/The-Last-Christmas\">The Last Christmas.<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #373737;\">The legendary\u00a0<\/span><strong><a style=\"color: #1982d1;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mspaintadventures.com\/?s=6\">Homestuck<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"color: #373737;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>which is\u2026 Homestuck. \u00a0I&#8217;m still working my way through\u00a0this. \u00a0Best on a 7&#8243;
