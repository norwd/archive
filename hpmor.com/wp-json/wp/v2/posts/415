the day before the update &#8211; but something came up and I couldn&#8217;t work on HPMOR for that day. \u00a0Will try to make it up next month.<\/p>\n<p>Under the circumstances, I think I&#8217;d better answer a question that I&#8217;ve been a bit coy about up until now:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I knew from literally the first chapter how the story would end. \u00a0We have not gotten lost.<\/li>\n<li>The fic&#8217;s plot will resolve at least as much as got resolved in the original Rowling books. \u00a0All currently open plot parentheses\u00a0<em>will<\/em> be closed &#8211;

I&#8217;m strongly tempted to &#8211; but it doesn&#8217;t come at a very good break point to leave the story. \u00a0It&#8217;s not so much a dramatic cliffhanger, as that it wouldn&#8217;t be a finished place to leave things while writing the rest of the arc. \u00a0I&#8217;ll finish Ch. 86, see if the rest goes faster, and then if it doesn&#8217;t go faster, post Ch. 86.<\/p>\n<p>The fic is not abandoned;
