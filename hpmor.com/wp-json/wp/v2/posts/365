\u00a0Don&#8217;t panic! \u00a0This isn&#8217;t a <em>rewrite,<\/em>\u00a0just a few\u00a0revisions. \u00a0Ch. 1-20 have some stylistic and character inconsistencies with the later chapters; they were written before everyone&#8217;s personality had settled down more firmly in my mind, and there are some basic writing errors I now know how to correct. \u00a0Yesterday I revised Ch. 1-4 on FF.net, and if you don&#8217;t see any visible alterations it&#8217;s because the changes were pretty minor. \u00a06, 7, and 9 are the main chapters that might require larger revisions, and I expect there to be some controversy.<\/p>\n<p>Today I got to Ch. 5 (again minor alterations only) and am, at this instant, almost done with Ch. 6, which was the first chapter to require major repair. \u00a0One section of the chapter had Mood Whiplash &#8211; tension rising too quickly, with insufficient warning &#8211; which I think I&#8217;ve now repaired mostly. \u00a0The deeper problem in Ch. 6 is that Harry&#8217;s conflict with Professor McGonagall looks too much like a victory &#8211; it is a <em>major<\/em>\u00a0flaw of Methods that Harry doesn&#8217;t lose hard until Ch. 10, so he must at least not win too much before then. \u00a0That&#8217;s the part I&#8217;m working on at this very instant.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow I hope to get to Ch. 7 and Ch. 9. \u00a0In Ch. 7, the Harry-and-Draco conversation needs to be toned down even further because multiple parents have announced their intention to have their children read this fanfic &#8211; and I know that revision is going to be controversial, but Draco&#8217;s current conversation is also a little out-of-character by the standards of the Draco in later chapters. \u00a0And in Ch. 9, I&#8217;m trying to decide whether to remove the Ghostbusters song entirely, or just foreshadow\/explain it harder &#8211; a lot of people loved it, but a lot of people hated it, and I&#8217;m not sure HPMOR needs the extra variance.<\/p>\n<p>And before anyone asks, the printed version of HPMOR that someone made briefly available on Lulu was taken down &#8211; probably due to complaints from the troll forum Dark Lord Potter; from what I can see of the chronology, the book was taken down a few moments after someone posted a Dark Lord Potter thread accusing me (it wasn&#8217;t me) of selling the book for a profit (the poster made it available at Lulu&#8217;s base cost). \u00a0This particular forum hates hates hates Methods and anything to do with it, so you can probably assume they&#8217;ll complain to any service you use to make HPMOR generally available in printed form.<\/p>\n<p>I am now biting the bullet and starting on Britpicking Ch. 1-37 &#8211; trying to eliminate Americanisms from the test. \u00a0See the just-launched\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/HPMOR\/comments\/ueduz\/authors_britpick_thread_ch_137\/\">Official Britpick Thread<\/a> on \/r\/HPMOR. \u00a0Please note that after some bad prior experiences, I am hoping for actual British readers, rather than Americans working from Internet guides, to offer their advice. \u00a0No Britpicks have been contributed yet, so assistance is much desired!<\/p>\n<p>Also much desired are <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheet\/viewform?formkey=dEFJQXd6S1M4V3duS2podVR5dXdzRlE6MQ#gid=0\">more Bay area test subjects<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0for testing rationality-training units. \u00a0We&#8217;re starting to run out!
