I started by posting 78 before 85 was finished &#8211; so I gave up and wrote the previous alternate ending. \u00a0Also, I didn&#8217;t want to have the fic spend a long time with a current stopping-point\u00a0<em>quite<\/em> that gloomy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>86:<\/strong> \u00a0I regret that I could not come up with any reasonable way to have Harry shout\u00a0<em>&#8220;Temporal fugue!&#8221;<\/em> or\u00a0<em>&#8220;Kage bunshin no jutsu!&#8221;<\/em> before attacking.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why the heck Ch. 86 took so long, it can be summed up as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>70%: Not enough hours to work on HPMOR. \u00a086 &amp; 87 arrived courtesy of my employer authorizing me to work full-time on Methods for a week.<\/li>\n<li>30%: Ch. 86 is (1) a bunch of fiddly things that needed to happen before the next arc so everything keeps moving in the right direction, (2) mostly in the form of dialogue affecting people&#8217;s states of knowledge, in (3) a &#8216;reaction&#8217; chapter where momentum is naturally low. \u00a0I ended up deleting a good deal of what I wrote for 86 because it just wasn&#8217;t possible to pack in\u00a0<em>all\u00a0<\/em>the fiddly stuff, and I figured I was probably overestimating how much fiddly stuff was needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ch. 87 (Hermione-centric) went much faster and will go up on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Ch. 88\u00a0<em>must<\/em> begin a longer sequence and the longer sequence has some fiddly bits. \u00a0So there&#8217;ll probably be another interval before Ch. 88 and its attached sequence gets posted.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Center for Applied Rationality update:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Center for Applied Rationality is holding <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/appliedrationality.org\/workshops\/\">4-day\u00a0workshops on Jan 25-28 and Mar 1-4<\/a>.<\/strong> \u00a0These are high-intensity workshops aimed at <strong>entrepreneurs, hackers,<\/strong>\u00a0and other ambitious, analytic folk;
