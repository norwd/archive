&#8211; in a world where only 20-30% of studies replicate, they not only search the literature, but try to figure out what&#8217;s actually true.) \u00a0MetaMed offered to demonstrate by tackling the problem of my ever-advancing sleep cycle.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of the things I&#8217;ve <em>previously<\/em>\u00a0tried:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking low-dose melatonin 1-2 hours before bedtime<\/li>\n<li>Using timed-release melatonin<\/li>\n<li>Installing red lights (blue light tells your brain not to start making melatonin)<\/li>\n<li>Using blue-blocking sunglasses after sunset<\/li>\n<li>Wearing earplugs<\/li>\n<li>Using a sleep mask<\/li>\n<li>Watching the sunrise<\/li>\n<li>Watching the sunset<\/li>\n<li>Blocking out all light from the windows in my bedroom using aluminum foil, then lining the door-edges with foam to prevent light from slipping in the cracks, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to use a sleep mask<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 15px;\">Spending a total of ~$2200 on three different mattresses (I cannot afford the high-end stuff, so I tried several mid-end ones)<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Trying 4 different pillows, including memory foam, and finally settling on a folded picnic blanket stuffed into a pillowcase (everything else was too thick)<\/li>\n<li>Putting 2 humidifiers in my room, a warm humidifier and a cold humidifier, in case dryness was causing my nose to stuff up and thereby diminish sleep quality<\/li>\n<li>Buying an auto-adjusting CPAP machine for $650 off Craigslist in case I had sleep apnea. \u00a0($650 is half the price of the sleep study required to determine if you need a CPAP machine.)<\/li>\n<li>Taking modafinil and R-modafinil.<\/li>\n<li>Buying a gradual-light-intensity-increasing, sun alarm clock for ~$150<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Not all of this was futile &#8211; I kept the darkened room, the humidifiers, the red lights, the earplugs, and one of the mattresses; and continued taking the low-dose \u00a0and time-release melatonin. \u00a0But that didn&#8217;t prevent my sleep cycle from advancing 3 hours per week (until my bedtime was after sunrise, whereupon I would lose several days to staying awake until sunset, after which my sleep cycle began slowly advancing again).<\/p>\n<p>MetaMed produced a long summary of extant research on non-24 sleep disorder, which I skimmed, and concluded by saying that &#8211; based on how the nadir of body temperature varies for people with non-24 sleep disorder and what this implied about my circadian rhythm &#8211; their best suggestion, although it had little or no clinical backing, was that I should take my low-dose melatonin 5-7 hours before bedtime, instead of 1-2 hours, a recommendation which I&#8217;d never heard anywhere before.<\/p>\n<p>And it worked.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t *#&amp;$ing believe that #*$%ing worked.<\/p>\n<p>(EDIT in response to reader questions: \u00a0&#8220;Low-dose&#8221; melatonin is 200microgram (mcg) = 0.2 mg. \u00a0Currently I&#8217;m taking <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Puritans-Pride-Melatonin-200-mcg-120-Tablets\/dp\/B004R614MG\/\">0.2mg<\/a> 5.5hr in advance, and taking <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Natrol-Melatonin-Release-Tablets-90-Count\/dp\/B000U5ZPJ6\/\">1mg timed-release<\/a> just before closing my eyes to sleep. \u00a0However, I worked up to that over time &#8211; I started out just taking <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Life-Extension-Melatonin-300-Capsules\/dp\/B000X9QZZ2\/\">0.3mg<\/a> total, and I would recommend to anyone else that they start at 0.2mg.)<\/p>\n<p>Sticker shock warning: \u00a0MetaMed&#8217;s charge for an analysis starts at $5K, or around double the cost of everything else I tried put together &#8211; it&#8217;s either for people who have money, or people who have resistant serious problems. \u00a0(Of course MetaMed dreams of eventually converting all of medicine to a saner footing,\u00a0but right now they have to charge significant amounts to initial customers.) \u00a0And by the nature of MetaMed&#8217;s task, results are definitely not guaranteed &#8211;
