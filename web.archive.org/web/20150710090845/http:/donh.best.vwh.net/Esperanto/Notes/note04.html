<h1 align="center">"Velkintajn Foliojn Deþiras..."</h1>
<h2 align="center">No. 4 of a series of occasional notes to aid in the 
learning of Esperanto</h2>

<p align="left">
There are a few situations in which English-speaking Esperantists tend to make 
a really horrible error with their participles, confusing the past active and 
past passive participle. I thought of this the other day when I saw an extremely 
competent Esperanto speaker, in a newsgroup posting, refer to a *"velkita folio" 
(apparently "withered leaf").
</p>

<p align="left">
Well, let's be charitable -- it might have been a simple typo. But in far too many 
cases I've heard members of Esperanto groups, in conversations, refer to themselves 
as *"pagita membro" (a paid member). Show me a group in which I can be a "pagita 
membro" and I'll join at once, my only question being: "How much?" as I hold out 
my hand for my stipend.
</p>

<p align="left">
Problem is that, in English, we almost invariably assume that the past participle 
is passive, and so when translating it into Esperanto without thinking, we almost 
always use the -ITA ending. But even in English the past participle isn't always 
passive. Take a look at two situations:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
(1) When the participle is used as an adjective. In this situation, the participle 
    of a <em>transitive verb</em> (one that can take a direct object) is <em>almost always</em> passive. 
    But the participle of an <em>intransitive verb</em> (one that can't take a direct 
    object) is <em>always</em> active. [Some verbs have both transitive and intransitive 
    meanings, in which case the participle can be either active or passive]. 
    Examples (with Esperanto translations given later):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
    A satisfied customer ("to satisfy" is transitive -- participle is passive)<br>
    A fallen tree ("to fall" is intransitive -- participle is active)<br>
    A drowned rat ("to drown" can be either -- participle can be either, depending on meaning)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
(2) When the participle is used as part of a compound verb, it is neither active nor 
    passive -- activity or passivity is determined by the helping verb ("to have" or 
    "to be" respectively. Examples:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
    The customer has satisfied me (active)<br>
    The customer was satisfied (passive)<br>
    The tree has fallen (active)<br>
    The tree ... woops! an intransitive verb can't have a passive form!<br>
    The rat has drowned (active)<br>
    The rat was drowned (passive)
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
There are, as usual, a few exceptions to these rules. The most obvious one, to my 
mind, at least, is that obnoxious "paid". In this case, used as an adjective, it 
can be active ("paid member") or passive ("paid hit-man"). The active use, in this 
particular case, is effectively an idiom.
</p>

<p align="left">
In Esperanto, of course, activity or passivity is a function of the participial 
ending only. Any intransitive verb can have an active participle; any transitive 
verb can have either an active or a passive participle. And they are used exactly 
as they are meant. Examples:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
(1) When the participle is used as an adjective:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
    Kontentigita ac^etanto. (n.b.: Most people would simply say "kontenta ac^etanto")<br>
    Falinta arbo<br>
    Droninta rato (n.b.: verbs in Esperanto are generally either transitive or 
        intransitive, not both)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
(2) When the participle is part of a "compound verb". WARNING: In Esperanto there 
    really is no such animal -- the only helping verb is "esti", the participle is 
    in reality an adjective, and the English compound verb effectively becomes the 
    simple Esperanto form <em>X-o estas Y-a</em>, where Y is the participle. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
    La ac^etanto estas kontentiginta min<br>
    La ac^etanto estis kontentigita<br>
    La arbo estas falinta<br>
    La rato estas droninta<br>
    La rato estis dronigita
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
Now look at our two misexamples. "Withered leaf" -- is this a leaf that <em>has</em> withered 
or a leaf that <em>was</em> withered? Actually, "to wither" is, I believe, intransitive -- at 
least in this usage -- and we are really trying to say <em>has withered</em>. So we are 
definitely talking "active", and we want <em>velkinta folio</em>.
</p>

<p align="left">
"Paid member" is a bit more difficult, since "to pay" is most definitely transitive, and 
most uses of "paid" are definitely passive. "Paid money" is, for instance, <em>pagita mono</em>; 
and "a paid hit-main" is definitely <em>pagita asasino</em>. But "paid member" is not "a member 
who was paid" but "a member who <em>has</em> paid", and the Esperanto, then, has to be 
<em>paginta membro</em>.
</p>

<p align="left">
Ultimately, when you need to use a past participle, always think of what you are trying 
to say. As a simple rule of thumb, try thinking of your participle in terms of the 
following formula: "who/which [has, was] done whatever is in the verb". If you must 
select "has", the participle is always active (-INTA); if, rather, you'd select 
"was", the participle is passive (-ITA).

</p>

<p align="left">
Simple exercises:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
(1) Use participles to translate the following phrases ("to post" = <em>afiþi</em>, at 
    least in internet parlance):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
    The woman who-has-posted<br>
    The information that-was-posted<br>
    The tree has fallen.<br>
    The cat has eaten the rat.<br>
    The rat was eaten by the cat.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p align="left">
The alert reader will have noticed that the apparently symmetric English "has" and "was" 
in the examples given above are replaced by the unsymmetric Esperanto "estas" and "estis" 
respectively. At this point the alert reader should be saying, wisely: "Huh???"
</p>

<p align="left">
The problem is not that the Esperanto forms are unsymmetric, but that the English 
<em>meanings</em> are unsymmetric. Simply put,
</p>

<blockquote>
  X has Yed
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
means: "X <em>is</em> in a state of having Yed".
</p>

<p align="left">
On the other hand, 
</p>
  
<blockquote>
  X was Yed
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
<em>generally</em> means "X <em>was</em> in a state of having been Yed".
</p>

<p align="left">
So the meanings aren't really very symmetric after all, even if the forms are. 
In Esperanto, this non-symmetricity of meanings is reflected in the forms used.
</p>

<p align="left">
Unfortunately, that second example can also (occasionally) mean: "X <em>was</em> in a state 
of <em>being</em> Yed", 
or even "X was coming into a state of being Yed" -- the meaning has to be determined from 
context. The same thing is true, to greater and lesser degrees, in certain other European 
languages. This led to the great several-decade-long war of -ATA vs. -ITA, which detractors of 
Esperanto have often pointed to as an example of impreciseness in the use of the participle 
system. Sadly, it was nothing of the sort -- it was a reflection of such imprecision in the 
native languages of those who fought over the uses and meanings of these participles. 
Considered strictly in the context of Esperanto, the participles' use and meanings are 
quite clear and precise.
