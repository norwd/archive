<h1 align="center">Very, Very Short Sentences</h1>
<h2 align="center">No. 1 of a series of occasional notes to aid in the 
learning of Esperanto</h2>

<p align="left">
If you turn to Unit Six of Cresswell &amp; 
Hartley's <em>Teach Yourself Esperanto</em>, 
you'll find, right at the beginning, that 
some sentences -- relating to weather -- 
consist of a verb without a subject. You 
can say, to use the examples in the book:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>pluvas</strong>  = it's raining<br>
  <strong>neøas</strong>   = it's snowing<br>
  <strong>hajlas</strong>  = it's hailing<br>
  <strong>frostas</strong> = it's freezing
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
This is very nice because it means that you 
don't have to learn a lot of words to start 
talking in Esperanto -- especially since the 
weather is always a great topic of conversation! 
Of course, there are a lot of other weather 
words that can be used in this way:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>ventas</strong>       = it's windy<br>
  <strong>varmas</strong>       = it's hot<br>
  <strong>malvarmas</strong>    = it's cold<br>
  <strong>nebulas</strong>      = it's foggy<br>
  <strong>nubas</strong>        = it's cloudy<br>
  <strong>fulmas</strong>       = there's lightning<br>
  <strong>tondras</strong>      = it's thundering<br>
  <strong>fulmotondras</strong> = it's thunderstorming<br>
  <strong>tempestas</strong>    = it's stormy<br>
  <strong>uraganas</strong>     = there's hurricanes<br>
  <strong>ciklonas</strong>     = there are tornadoes<br>
  <strong>trombas</strong>      = there are waterspouts
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
Some fun, hey? You can find other terms usable 
in this way in the <em>Meteologia Terminaro</em> (UEA, 
1960).
</p>

<p align="left">
Not so commonly known or used -- probably 
because similar expressions are not all that 
widely used in many national languages -- is 
the fact that in Esperanto you can make 
subject-free sentences even when you're not 
talking about the weather. This is possible 
any time you are talking about <strong>a general 
condition</strong>, one having to do with the 
environment or ambience that you're 
discussing. As an example, consider the 
following sentence that a Chinese friend 
once wrote in a letter to me:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>Plenis en la æambro je homoj.</strong>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
As you can see, the verb -- "plenis" -- has 
no subject. Now ordinarily I myself would have 
used, for the same situation, a form parallel 
to the English:
</p>

<blockquote>
  The room was full of people.<br>
  <strong>La æambro estis plena je homoj.</strong>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
The difference is that I would be describing a 
<strong>characteristic of the room itself</strong>, while my 
friend was describing <strong>the situation in the 
room</strong>.
</p>

<p align="left">
Is there any reason to choose one over the 
other? A pedant would probably say that her 
method of speaking more closely mirrors the 
reality of the situation; but as far as 
communicating the general idea to people, 
either expression is equally good. Nevertheless, 
the subject-free verb allows you a certain 
amount of stylistic variation in how you speak 
or write -- something worth cultivating.
</p>

<p align="left">
Simple exercises:
</p>

<p align="left">
(1) From "brumo" = haze, say: "It's hazy."
</p>

<p align="left">
(2) From "tajfuno" = typhoon, say: "There's a 
    typhoon."
</p>

<p align="left">
(3) Here's a cute one. Take the sentence given 
    above, "Plenas en la æambro je homoj," and 
    reduce it to a two-word sentence, a 
    subject-free verb and an adverb, with the 
    same meaning as the sentence given. Hints: 
    (1) use Esperanto's system of forming one 
    new word by joining two old ones together 
    to create the verb, and (2) try collapsing 
    one of the short prepositional phrases into 
    a single adverb, also common practice in 
    Esperanto.
</p>

<h2 align="center">A Couple of Other Very, Very, Very Short Sentences</h2>

<p align="left">
Esperanto also has a lot of interjections (some of 
which are of the sort known as "expletives"). Two 
very useful interjections are:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>Tuj!</strong> = immediately, at once!<br>
  <strong>Ek!</strong> = Get a move on, get the lead out!
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
You may want to memorize these. Use them only in 
case of great need, though.
