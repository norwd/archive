<h1 align="center">Freedom of Word Order?</h1>
<h2 align="center">No. 3 of a series of occasional notes to aid in the 
learning of Esperanto</h2>

<p align="left">
Esperanto speakers like to brag about the freedom of word order that the language 
provides. To an extent -- to a very great extent! -- this bragging is justified. 
Where English is, to some degree, locked into a subject-verb-object order in its 
sentences, and an adjective must generally precede the noun it modifies (there are 
exceptions to these rules, governed by some very special grammatical rules), Esperanto 
allows any permutation of [object, subject, verb], and the adjective is not only allowed 
to follow its noun as well as precede it, but can even be separated from it by other 
words in the sentence, without loss of comprehension. These new freedoms are made 
possible by, of course, the much-maligned -N ending, and the much-maligned noun-
adjective agreement, respectively.
</p>

<p align="left">
At a lower level, however, word order is not quite as free. "La" always precedes the 
noun with which it is associated (as does "tiu"). A preposition always precedes its 
object. And when we come to adverbs, we really have to watch where we put them.
</p>

<p align="left">
The Esperanto adverb, like its counterparts in other European languages, has several 
functions. It can modify a verb (hence the name), an adjective, or even another adverb. 
In other words, while an adjective is an attribute of an object, an adverb is an 
attribute of an action or another attribute. Given this multiplicity of functions, it 
seems somehow unfair that the adverb can only have one (or, if it shows location, two) 
forms, where an adjective can have four.
</p>

<p align="left">
The outcome of this is that, while you can move adjectives around to suit the 
circumstances and your own preferences of the moment, for an adverb to be correctly 
understood it has to go, preferably, before the word it modifies. For instance:
</p>

<p align="left">
<blockquote>
  La libro aspektas ruøe = The book looks red.<br>
  La libro vere aspektas ruøe = The book truly looks red.<br>
  La libro aspektas vere ruøe = The book looks truly red.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p align="left">
Of course, it doesn't hurt to put a noun in between an adverb and a verb, since 
the adverb can't modify a noun:
</p>

<p align="left">
<blockquote>
  Vere la libro aspektas ruøe = Truly, the book looks red.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p align="left">
This can even liven up your style a little.
</p>

<p align="left">
Also, if there's only word that an adverb can modify, then obviously it 
doesn't have to precede that word, but can go just about anywhere:
</p>

<p align="left">
<blockquote>
  Surtable la libro sidas = The book is sitting on the table.<br>
  La libro surtable sidas = The book is sitting on the table.<br>
  La libro sidas surtable = The book is sitting on the table.
</blockquote>
</p>

<hr>

<p align="left">
On the other hand, there are a few words that are often classed as 
adverbs (you will find them listed as such in the <em>Plena Analiza Gramatiko 
de Esperanto</em>), but aren't. These are particles which can be attached not only to 
verbs, adjectives and adverbs, but also to nouns. I can think of four (or maybe 
five) offhand. These words should <em>always</em> be placed immediately before the 
word with which they're associated.
</p>

<p align="left">
They are: <em>ankaý</em>, <em>eæ</em>, <em>ne</em> (and, by extension, <em>jes</em>), 
<em>nur</em>.
</p>

<p align="left">
Consider the following examples:
</p>

<p align="left">
<blockquote>
  Eæ la libro aspektas ruøe = Even the book looks red (other things do, too).<br>
  La libro eæ aspektas ruøe = The book even looks red (it does other things, as well).<br>
  La libro aspektas eæ ruøe = The book even looks red (its appearance has some other 
    qualities, too)
</blockquote>
</p>

<p align="left">
I've stuck <em>jes</em> in here because of its formal symmetry with <em>ne</em>. In actual 
practice, of course, that symmetry does not exist, because a sentence without <em>ne</em> 
is <em>assumed</em> to be a positive declaration; no positive particle is needed. There is 
a growing tendency these days, however, to use <em>jes</em> as an emphatic particle. So 
far, it would primarily be used only with a verb, as follows:
</p>

<p align="left">
<blockquote>
  La libro ne aspektas ruøe = The book doesn't look red<br>
  La libro jes aspektas ruøe = The book most emphatically looks red
</blockquote>
</p>

<p align="left">
But there is no reason to assume that it can't be used with other types of 
words as well (this even happens in English, though usually as a parenthetical and 
literary remark):
</p>

<p align="left">
  La libro aspektas jes ruøe = (approx) The book looks, yes, red
</p>

<p align="left">
Simple exercises:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
(1) Translate the following into Esperanto, using simple sentences containing only 
    six words each. You may find that you don't want to use a standard (i.e. 
    English) adjective-noun order, for better clarity.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
    It was not the boy who caught a big fish.<br>
    The boy did not catch a big fish.<br>
    It was not a big fish that the boy caught.<br>
    The boy caught a fish that was not big.
</p>
</blockquote>
