Purpose
═════════════════════

It is the intent to display a broad range of abrasive particle size information as compactly and intelligibly as possible.  Since these cover several orders of magnitude a logarithmic scale is most appropriate.  A logarithmic scale also has the property of equidistant spacing for any geometric progression, meaning that a theoretically ideal abrasive series will be uniformly spaced in the chart.  Stated another way, two grits that differ by a specific ratio will be a fixed distance apart on the vertical axis of the chart whether they are 1.0 and 1.5 micron or 200 and 300 micron.

The chart started out as a table of conversions from grit number to microns but grew in scope to include products that are directly specified in microns.  It is therefore also to a degree a record of availability of products that may be of interest in certain markets.  The logarithmic visual representation is intended to be easier to internalize than numbers simply read from a list.

The chart does not and cannot quantify or compare absolute performance.  (See section "What the chart is not" below.)



Reading the Chart
═════════════════════

The chart consists of a series of labels arranged in columns by family.  The vertical placement of each label correlates to particle size in microns (micrometers).  Some columns contain more than one product or standard such as the column containing both Edge Pro Diamond and Norton stones.  In each case the series are differentiated by color or break and the column labels match the relative placement of the first item of each.  ("Edge Pro ◊" is above "Norton" in both the column label and the column itself, and all Norton items share a distinguishing color.)  The "Other" column has every item named so there is no confusion. (Refer to Acronyms and Abbreviations below.)  In single-family columns congruent standards and alternate names are written in smaller type below the reference standard title, e.g. ISO 8486 below FEPA Bonded, and JIS R 6010 below FEPA Coated. (JIS R 6010 for coated product is not to be confused with JIS R 6001 for bonded product, charted separately.)

Some columns have a selection of items highlighted, for example the 3M Trizact™ CF "Gator" belts within the Trizact category, and diamond products in the Norton column, with annotation in matching color.  Others have annotations referring to specific items by name or the entire column.

Range bars, terminating in a point, represent particle size limits imposed on the large majority of a sample, such as D3 and D94 points.  Variance bars, terminating in a crossbar, represent the allowed 
tolerance of the median value D50.  A bar terminating in an arrowhead indicates an open-ended grade with no limit on how fine a passing sample may be.  In the Natural Stone column these marks have a less rigorous meaning, clarified below.

Items with a background color represent products with a physical color such as the lapping films and Pride Water Stones, or a color expressly associated with the product such as the DMT® products.  The colors representing physical product color should be consistent within a series but will not be consistent between series.  For example the colors of the 3M Diamond Microfinishing Film should be reasonably accurate relative to each other, nevertheless the 30, 9, and 3 micron films might be the same physical color as the 3M Aluminum Oxide Lapping Film despite being a different color in the chart.

The black and orange vertical dashed lines (barber poles) provide a visual reference for a constant geometric spacing.  Each segment (black or orange) represents a doubling or halving of particle size.

Items of notably uncertain origin or placement have been styled in gray type.  (See details below.)

Items in purple type were displaced vertically to eliminate overlap and make the labels readable.  In the base chart:

 • The Micro-Mesh™ MXD 600, 800, and 1200 values are nearly identical and had to be displaced by 5%.
 • Clover® "B" and "C" compounds overlapped; they were displaced 4%.
 • Baryonyx Knife Company (BYXCO) "Bull Thistle" stone was displaced 3%.
 • BYXCO "Ptarmigan" and Tormek "PA-70" are each 3µ and were displaced 5%.

What the chart shows
═════════════════════

Where possible the volume or mass median diameter, abbreviated D50, is used.  Where a standard specifies an acceptable range of D50 values the arithmetic mean of the extrema is used.  If a grade is specified by sieve fractions the D50 range is approximated.  Some sources, especially those for specific products rather than standards, specify only "average particle size in microns" or merely "microns."

It might appear that the format of the chart lacks precision but in fact it is more than sufficient—its precision exceeds any reasonable measure of the underlying data.  In the base chart a vertical shift of one pixel represents a change of about one percent, while the tightest range for a single D50 value specified by any standard is more than ±3% with most values being closer to ±9%.  Further the standards allow particles in significant quantities (D3 and D94 values) over a much larger range than this.  In revision 14 these tolerances are graphically represented where applicable.  A few labels had to be displaced to prevent crowding; these values are colored differently as an indicator as noted above.

The base chart is arbitrarily limited to values between 0.2 and 700 microns.  Macrogrit standards start as coarse as grit 4, equivalent to roughly 5000 microns (5mm), and there are products (e.g. Linde B, LUXOR® Orange, lapping films) that extended well into the submicron range that are omitted from the base chart. Extended range is available for customized editions.

A single sieve standard, ASTM E11 (2020), is included for reference.  Sieves are not themselves abrasive product but provide the foundation for grading macrogrit sizes—roughly 220 and coarser.

Charted microgrit values for ANSI Bonded, ANSI Coated, and JIS R 6001 are those specified for electrical resistance (Coulter counter) method.  Charted microgrit values for FEPA F and FEPA P* are those for photosedimentometer or Sedigraph method.  *See details below.

International Standards ISO 6344 and ISO 8486 are codifications of FEPA P (Coated) and FEPA F (Bonded) respectively.  JIS R 6001, ANSI B74.12 (bonded), and GB 2477 all share effectively the same macrogrit sieve specifications as ISO 8486, while microgrit specifications are distinct.  Edge Pro basic alumina and silicon carbide stones are FEPA F graded, distinct from Edge Pro Diamond Matrix Stones charted separately.

International Standards ISO 6106 is reflected in localized standards including GB/T 6406-2016 and GOST R 53922-2010, and supersedes others including DIN 848-1:1988 and AS 4514-2006.  Grain designations are prefixed with D or B for Diamond or cBN (cubic born nitride) respectively.

Revision 12 updates the FEPA P / ISO 6344 column to draft 2021 values in which grades P3000, P4000, and P5000 are codified.  Grades P240 to P1200 are unchanged, via US sedimentometer.  Grades P1500 and finer are now specified by Sedigraph measurement.  For the purpose of charting the conversion algorithm from ISO 8486-2:1996 is (inversely) applied to grades P240 through P1200.  This provides approximate Eppendorf photosedimentometer equivalents from US sedimentometer values, addressing the discontinuity that was introduced between the raw values of P1200 and P1500 due the change of measurement apparatus.  This conversion implicitly assumes standard particle characteristics.

In revision 13 median sizes for standard sieve grades (macrogrits, generally 220 and coarser) were computed directly from the sieve specifications, replacing representative values declared by authoritative sources.  Now the chart may disagree with those values but grits which share identical specifications are represented congruently.  Extensive effort was made to compute reasonable midpoints from the sieve specifications.  Least-squares fits to the lower and upper retained fraction limits were used to establish a range for median values; the suite of models included Rosin–Rammler and log-normal distributions as described in sieve analysis literature for particles produced through comminution, as well as log-linear interpolation.  For ISO 8486 grits 150, 180, and 220 the midpoints chosen were biased toward the coarse end of their ranges as these three grits have an expanded fine limit relative to grits 4 through 120 while the coarse limit follows a geometric progression throughout.

ANSI Bonded values come from ANSI B74.12 (Table 2) and B74.10, for macrogrits by sieving and microgrits by electrical resistance measurement respectively.  ANSI Coated values are from ANSI B74.18.  Sieve specifications for the macrogrits differ between the two, while microgrits 240 to 600 share a common specification.  B74.18 ends at 600 while B74.10 continues through 1200.  Allowing for measurement method the present ANSI Coated values are in agreement with the CAMI-approved Product Standard PS8-67 (1967).  CAMI was the previous ANSI sub-authority before UAMA.  In rv.9 through rv.12 Bonded and Coated were shown in a single column as the microgrits are shared and UAMA declared: "In comparing coated with bonded macrogrits, the most that can be said is that the sizes are approximately the same, but the specified requirements differ sufficiently to require individual appraisal of batches of material."  In rv.13 they were split to show differences revealed by the analysis referenced above.

ANSI B74.12 contains a very loose specification for grit 240 with an indeterminate D50—over half of its volume could be dust.  This was not used as B74.10 contains a much tighter specification for grit 240 but its existence should be noted.

The "Diamond Compound" column includes colors for an apparent ad hock near-standard for US diamond paste manufacturers and suppliers.  These include: Advanced Abrasives Corporation, Amplex Superabrasives, BORIDE Engineered Abrasives, Diamond Innovations, DIANAMIC® Abrasive Products, Engis®, Norton, PPT Pro Polishing Tools, United States Products Co., and others.  The color/micron mapping is not exact; they are to serve as a guideline only.

"Natural Stone" items are charted by estimated performance rather than physical geologic grain size.  This departure is necessary for the values to have practical meaning.  All items represent a range though some item names eclipse any range bars that could have been plotted.  The Variance and Range marks hold a different meaning in this column: the crossbar represents a nominal range of performance, while the dot represents additional variation that exists for this type of stone.  An individual sample will not exhibit a performance range that covers this entire span.  These estimates are a synthesis of multiple sources including Henk Bos' four part "Grinding & Honing" series in Info 20M [ https://bosq.home.xs4all.nl/info%2020m/ ], Dan's Whetstone Company, NaturalWhetstones.com, and especially input from members of KitchenKnifeForums.com (KKF).  See caveats below.

"3M Polishing" is short for 3M Wetordry™ Polishing Paper, product designations 281Q, 286Q, 481Q, 486Q.

"Grit Symbol" is an antiquated naming scheme for coated abrasives.  The series shown is valid for alumina, silicon carbide, and garnet.  Similar naming has been applied to flint or emery but the scale is not the same.

"Glasspaper" or glass paper is also known as cabinet paper.  Historically the abrasive could be crushed glass or flint but it seems flint is now universal.  This is an old grading system that is still in use but significant variation exists in stated equivalents by remaining manufacturers.  In revision 13 midpoints computed from the sieve specifications in British Standard BS 871:1981 are used in place of these equivalents.  This standard is withdrawn and these values should be considered historic.  Grade "00" is specified only by an "All to pass" sieve of 90µ; it is therefore placed proportionately to the "All to pass" sizes given for the other grades and styled in gray.

"Diamond Mesh" values are nonstandard but in common and reasonably uniform use up to 14,000 (1 micron); finer than that large variations exist.

"Emery" values are approximate, possibly being brand, country, and even era dependent.  Not including these however would likely lead to conflation with Grit Symbol or Glasspaper grading, which they are not.

"Clover" compound values come from the Henkel Loctite Adhesive Sourcebook.  Micron values are given explicitly for "Average particle size of abrasive grains" and it also gives grit numbers on an unspecified scale from 54 through 1200.  The Technical Data Sheet dated 2005 reads: "Each grit is held within either ANSI or FEPA specifications for particle size distribution" however the listed micron values do not fall within the median ranges of either ANSI or FEPA, bonded or coated.  I cannot explain this discrepancy.

"New SuperStone" refers to ceramic fiber abrasive files from Argofile Japan Limited, not to be confused with Super Stone whetstones from Naniwa.

"Wicked Edge" values are the original ones provided by Wicked Edge, with adjustments from [ https://knife.wickededgeusa.com/forums/topic/2200-3000-diamond-stones/page/2/#post-52567 ].  A different table exists with discordant values. [ https://support.wickededgeusa.com/portal/en/kb/articles/wicked-edge-grit-micron-progression-chart ]  Wicked Edge was unresponsive to a request to clarify this situation.  For the time being the classic values are preserved as there is no indication of a corresponding change to the product.

As sub-sieve standards use different measurement apparatus, calibration media, and aggregating distributions their values are not directly comparable.  In general no attempt has been made to unify their representation through assumption-laden conversions, with the exception of FEPA P (Coated) as warranted by its internal discontinuity.



What the chart is not
═════════════════════

The chart does not and cannot quantify or compare absolute performance.  While the chart does contain specific products its primary purpose is to catalog and display different standards, including proprietary ones.  Since different products following the same standard may have vastly different performance due to different formulation it is impossible to make a direct comparison by these numbers alone.  Abrasive performance is not measured by particle size but by the rate that material is removed and the surface roughness of the finished piece under specific conditions, the latter by itself requiring multiple parameters to quantify.  (Ra, Rz, Rrms, etc.)  Abrasive performance is highly variable and depends upon at least these factors that are not quantified with a single median particle size figure:

 • hardness
 • chemical composition
 • friability (tendency to expose new edges and break into finer particles in use)
 • agglomeration or aggregation
 • particle angularity (sharpness)
 • particle sphericity (aspect ratio)
 • particle size distribution (e.g. tighter grading than standard)
 • backing or bonding characteristics (give, flex, etc.)
 • filler or carrier characteristics
 • cutting point density (open vs. closed coat, binder proportion etc.)
 • workpiece composition and hardness
 • pressure and speed of application (affecting grit penetration depth)
 • cutting aid (lubricant)
 • dressing or conditioning

A reference for several of these factors:  
  http://www.horiba.com/fileadmin/uploads/Scientific/eMag/PSA/Guidebook/pdf/PSA_Guidebook.pdf
  
Some practical examples:

 • Diamond compound on leather cuts much more slowly and produces a much higher surface finish than the same diamond grade bonded to or embedded in a metal lapping plate.

 • Soft but sharp abrasive may work very fast on soft metal yet be ineffective on high hardness steel.

 • Micro-Mesh™ pads are specifically designed to cut and finish in a manner finer than their actual particle size would indicate due to the cushioned abrasive and flexible bonding.

 • Open coat sandpaper leaves a rougher finish than closed coat paper with the same particle size as each grain has greater exposure and experiences higher pressure producing greather penetration.  Particle shape and orientation (e.g. electrostatically oriented coated abrasives) also have significant effects.

 • At higher grits coated abrasives typically act finer than bonded abrasives with the same particle size due to give of the backing and limited refreshment of the abrasive.
 
 • The Edge Pro Diamond Matrix 2300 stone was specifically formulated to follow the Edge Pro (FEPA F) 1000 stone, despite having a significantly larger particle size grade.
 
 • For high gloss polishing Solid Surface countertops 3M recommends: 366L 100μ dry; 268XA A35 damp; 268XA A10 damp; 268XA A5 damp; 286Q 9μ damp.  Note the apparent reversal from 5μ to 9μ between steps four and five.
 
 • Charts in https://www.asahidia.co.jp/eng/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/B02.pdf
 
Because (where possible) this chart displays actual particle size rather than estimated performance it diverges from some other references that you may find.  For example it is clearly stated by 3M that the Trizact A ratings are particle size in microns, yet some charts show them differently.  This may be explained by the fact that 3M includes charts giving approximate conversion to FEPA P in some of its literature.  These charts place the Trizact belts at a significantly finer grit than their grading, presumably because 3M claims them to finish to that level relative to some average FEPA P product.  This may be explained by tighter grading and/or their specific formulation.

Values based solely on equivalent or estimated performance are avoided with a few exceptions:

 • Spyderco ceramics initially imported from Komitadjie's chart (since refined)
 • 3M Scotch-Brite™ non-woven-fiber coated abrasive
 • New SuperStone ceramic fiber files from Argofile Japan Ltd.
 • Natural whetstones
 
Spyderco-type ceramic is a fused material and cannot be graded with the same particle distribution analysis as other abrasives.  For an examination of this see: http://moleculepolishing.wordpress.com/2013/08/08/the-mystery-of-the-spyderco-and-the-wicked-edge-ceramic-stones/  

Wicked Edge microfine ceramics were more recently examined in Molecule Polishing blog; https://moleculepolishing.wordpress.com/2016/03/20/ceramic-stones-for-the-weps-compared-again/ and https://moleculepolishing.wordpress.com/2016/03/20/speed-of-the-wicked-edge-stones-and-diamond-films/

Ceramic fiber cannot be treated as nominally-spherical particles.  Argofile Japan labels the New SuperStone files with JIS R 6001 grades corresponding to their performance.

Regarding Natural Stone it must be understood that even among experienced users there is some disagreement on performance estimates as different applications will provide different results.  The given ranges are large, sometimes extremely so, due not only to the variability of natural material but also to different applications and techniques including surface conditioning.  The latter is especially important for harder types of "novaculite" (Arkansas, Charnley Forest, Llyn Idwal) where performance is largely dependent on the surface finish applied, much like solid sintered ceramics from Spyderco, Norton Ascent, Idahone, etc.

Dan's Whetstone Company writes: "Arkansas Novaculite stones are classified by specific gravity and not the size of the grain.  The grain of the silica crystals that form Novaculite are essentially the same size, 3-5 microns, whether the stone is classified as Soft Arkansas or True Hard Arkansas."

KKF user captaincaed summarized: 

	• Hardness is often more important than abrasive particle size since the line between abrasive and binder is fuzzier in natural stones vs synths.
     If you have a solid mass of abrasive and the particles are large-ish, let's say 5-10um, the close packing and non-friability means you'll have
     a flat honing surface that finishes in the 0.1-1.0um "effective grit" range since you're only using the very tip of each abrasive iceberg.
     If you slurry a stone like this it will cut more like it's particle size implies, e.g. translucent Arkansas.
    
	• Many top ends of many stone ranges are when honing razors with fixed angles and light pressure.
     For knives I find the effective top end of the range much lower unless you're being incredibly careful/fussy.

	• Split ANSI Bonded and ANSI Coated to show differences in sieve specifications
	
	• Add "New SuperStone" ceramic files by Argofile Japan Limited; declared as JIS R 6001 equivalent grading
	
	• Realign derived values: Grit Symbol, Emery, Flex-Hone, Scotch-Brite, Bristle Disc
	
	• Remove "UAMA Coated" as no confirmation or provenance could be provided by UAMA
	
	• Restyle Clover 6A as not discontinued; it is still available in the Pat Gel® formulation
