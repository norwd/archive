<h3>Options</h3>
<p>Classic literate programming has language specific tools (WEB for Pascal, CWEB for C++,
and FWEB for Fortran). The language independent approach sacrifices some pretty-printing
and indexing abilities for generality (noweb, FunnelWeb, and nuweb). Other approaches
recognize pseudo statements written as comments in the source code instead of relying on
a secondary WEB source file. These systems are used for interface documentation (JavaDoc,
doxygen, DOC++, autoduck, POD) or for literate programming (CLiP, cnoweb).</p>

<h3>Literate Programming Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/cweb.html">The CWEB System of Structured
Documentation</a> is a version of WEB for documenting C, C++, and Java programs. WEB was
adapted to C by Silvio Levy in 1987, and since then both Knuth and Levy have revised and
enhanced the system in many ways, notably to support C++ and ANSI C. Thus CWEB combines
TeX with today's most widely used professional programming languages.</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nuweb/">nuweb</a> works with any programming
language and LaTeX.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/">noweb</a> is designed to meet the
needs of literate programmers while remaining as simple as possible. Its primary
advantages are simplicity, extensibility, and language-independence. Noweb uses 5 control
sequences to WEB's 27. The noweb manual is only 3 pages; an additional page explains how
to customize its LaTeX output. Noweb works "out of the box" with any programming
language, and supports TeX, latex, and HTML back ends. A back end to support full
hypertext or indexing takes about 250 lines; a simpler one can be written in 40 lines of
awk. The primary sacrifice relative to WEB is that code is seldom prettyprinted.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ross.net/funnelweb/">FunnelWeb</a> is a powerful
literate-programming macro preprocessor that enables you to weave programs and
documentation together. FunnelWeb is a production quality tool that was specifically
engineered for practical everyday use.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.physik.uzh.ch/~psaha/java/rambutan/">Rambutan</a> is a literate programming
system for Java, quite similar to CWEB and the original WEB system.</li>
<li><a href="http://w3.pppl.gov/~krommes/fweb_toc.html">FWEB</a> is a WEB system of
structured documentation for multiple languages (FORTRAN).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/xmlLitProg.html">SGML and Literate
Programming</a> Collection of references for literate programming techniques and style in
the context of descriptive markup languages, e.g., SGML, XML, DSSSL, HyTime, etc.
Numerous researchers have observed that the goals of information re-use and data
normalization embraced by both literate programming and SGML-based markup languages
provide the basis for using the two technologies together.</li>
<li><a href="http://xmlp.sourceforge.net/">xmLP</a> is a literate programming tool
written in XSL-T. xmLP differs from traditional literate programming tools when it comes
to weaving. Traditionally, weaving involves both generating cross-reference information
and producing formatted output. However, tools like XSL-T make it unnecessary for an XML
literate programming tool to deal with display rendering. Hence the xmLP weaver is
intentionally minimalist, and does nothing except add cross-reference information to the
original literate document.</li>
<li><a href="http://ocamaweb.sourceforge.net/">OCAMAWEB</a> is a CWEB like literate
programming tool. It is designed to target all languages and actually has a version
targeting the MATLAB language. OCAMAWEB is written in the OCAML programming language.
OCAMAWEB is actually intensively used at MIRIAD Technologies to produce technical
documentation for MATLAB codes.</li>
<li><a href="http://daniel.lanovaz.org/Site/Blog/Entries/2004/10/31_Thinking_with_Style.html">Thinking With Style</a>
This article is itself a software book. You can compile this book into an executable
program. A ?What You See Is What You Get? (WSYWIG) editor (Word 2003) created the
software book. The book is stored as XML.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Literate Programming - Editors</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://leoeditor.com/">Leo</a> is a new kind of

</ul>

<h3>Literate Programming - Supporting Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTex</a> TeX is a typesetting system
written by Donald Knuth, who says that it is "intended for the creation of beautiful
books and especially for books that contain a lot of mathematics".</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">Acrobat Reader</a>
View, navigate, and print PDF (portable document format) files.</li>
<li><a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a> tools are ports of the popular
GNU development tools for Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000. As a result, it is possible to easily
port many significant Unix programs without the need for extensive changes to the source
code. Even if the development tools are of little to no use to you, you may have interest
in the many standard Unix utilities provided with the package. They can be used both from
the bash shell (provided) or from the standard Windows command shell.</li>
