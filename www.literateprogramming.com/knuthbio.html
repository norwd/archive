<p>Donald E. Knuth was born on January 10, 1938 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He studied
mathematics as an undergraduate at Case Institute of Technology, where he also wrote
software at the Computing Center. The Case faculty took the unprecedented step of
awarding him a Master's degree together with the B.S. he received in 1960. After graduate
studies at California Institute of Technology, he received a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1963
and then remained on the mathematics faculty. Throughout this period he continued to be
involved with software development, serving as consultant to Burroughs Corporation from
1960-1968 and as editor of Programming Languages for ACM publications from 1964-1967.

<p>He joined Stanford University as Professor of Computer Science in 1968, and was appointed
to Stanford's first endowed chair in computer science nine years later. As a university
professor he introduced a variety of new courses into the curriculum, notably Data
Structures and Concrete Mathematics. In 1993 he became Professor Emeritus of The Art of
Computer Programming. He has supervised the dissertations of 28 students.

<p>Knuth began in 1962 to prepare textbooks about programming techniques, and this work
evolved into a projected seven-volume series entitled The Art of Computer Programming.
Volumes 1-3 first appeared in 1968, 1969, and 1973. Having revised these three in 1997,
he is now working full time on the remaining volumes. Approximately one million copies
have already been printed, including translations into six languages. He took ten years
off from this project to work on digital typography, developing the TeX system for
document preparation and the METAFONT system for alphabet design. Noteworthy by-products
of those activities were the WEB and CWEB languages for structured documentation, and the
accompanying methodology of Literate Programming. TeX is now used to produce most of the
world's scientific literature in physics and mathematics.

<p>His research papers have been instrumental in establishing several subareas of computer
science and software engineering: LR(k) parsing; attribute grammars; the Knuth-Bendix
algorithm for axiomatic reasoning; empirical studies of user programs and profiles;
analysis of algorithms. In general, his works have been directed towards the search for a
proper balance between theory and practice.

<p>Professor Knuth received the ACM Turing Award in 1974 and became a Fellow of the British
Computer Society in 1980, an Honorary Member of the IEEE in 1982. He is a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the National
Academy of Engineering, and a foreign associate of l'Academie des Sciences (Paris) and
Det Norske Videnskaps-Akademi (Oslo). He holds five patents and has published
approximately 160 papers in addition to his 19 books. He received the Medal of Science
from President Carter in 1979, the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize for
expository writing in 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences Award in 1987, the J.D.
Warnier Prize for software methodology in 1989, the Adelsköld Medal from the Swedish
Academy of Sciences in 1994, the Harvey Prize from the Technion in 1995, and the Kyoto
Prize for advanced technology in 1996. He was a charter recipient of the IEEE Computer
Pioneer Award in 1982, after having received the IEEE Computer Society's W. Wallace
McDowell Award in 1980; he received the IEEE's John von Neumann Medal in 1995. He holds
honorary doctorates from Oxford University, the University of Paris, St. Petersburg
University, and more than a dozen colleges and universities in America.

<p>Professor Knuth lives on the Stanford campus with his wife, Jill. They have two children,
John and Jennifer. Music is his main avocation.

<p>Featured Title: The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-3 Boxed Set By Knuth, Donald E.
For the past 20 years I've been making copious notes in my personal copies of The Art of
Computer Programming, whenever I've noticed how those books could be made better. Finally
the time is ripe to typeset those books from scratch, using the tools of digital
typography that I worked on during the 1980s. The new editions incorporate literally
thousands of improvements, including hundreds of instructive new exercises and answers to
exercises. I think most readers will enjoy these new things as much as I did when I first
learned them. I've been especially careful to include any new historical details that
have come to my attention, and to provide up-to-date information about all the research
problems stated in previous editions. Computer Science has been changing and growing at a
fantastic rate, yet I believe nearly everything in The Art of Computer Programming is
crucial information that will never become obsolete.
