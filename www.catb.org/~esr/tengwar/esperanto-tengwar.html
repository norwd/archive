<h1 class="c1">The Tengwar for Esperanto</h1>

<p>This paper describes a mode of the Tengwar of Feanor adapted for
the writing of the artificial language Esperanto.</p>

<p>The original Tengwar chart is in the appendices to <i>The Return
of the King</i> (volume III of <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>
(the chart is in Appendix E, page 494 of the Ballantine pb
edition). References to the Tengwar in this paper can be chased to
this chart:</p>

<div class="c2"><img src="tw.png"
alt="You need a PNG-capable browser." /></div>

<p>The chart is copied from Michael Everson's <a
href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n1641/n1641.htm">Unicode/ISO
10646-2 proposal for the Tengwar</a>. References are this given as
given as n(x/y), where n is Tolkien's number, x is the table column
number and y the row number. Where Tolkien describes a tehta that
appears in the Everson table but is unnumbered, I reference it
simply as (x/y).</p>

<p>In studying what follows, it is particularly important to
remember that in any given mode the Tengwar consonants form a
phonetic grid in which alterations in form correspond to
alterations in sound in a predictable way. Before continuing, you
should probably reread (or at least re-skim) Tolkien's discussion
of the Feanorian letters, pages 495-500 following the chart.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the relationships: There are 24 primary
Tengwar letters. The letters are organized into four series or
"T&eacute;mar". Each series is used to represent sounds created by
different parts of the mouth. Series I and II are almost always
used for dental and labial sounds. Series III is generally used for
either palatal or velar sounds and series IV for either velar or
labiovelar sounds, depending on the phonology of the language
represented. These four series were further broken down into six
grades or "Tyeller". Each grade is used to represent sounds created
by different ways that air flows through the mouth and nose. Grade
1 and 2 were used for voiceless and voiced plosives. Grade 3 and 4
were used for voiceless and voiced fricatives (including, in modern
terminology, affricates). Grade 5 was used for nasals. Grade 6 was
used for semi-vowel consonants. Each Tengwar letter was assigned a
phonetic value determined by its position in this grid. People
speaking different languages will often re-define this grid, so
only a few of the letters have a fixed phonetic value.</p>

<p>Vowels may be represented either by "tehtar" (diacriticals or
accent marks written above a preceding or following vowel) or by
dedicated letters ("full-writing"). Some other diacriticals and
letter modifications ccan be used to indicate dipthongization,
following s, and lengthening.</p>

<h1>Esperanto phonology and orthography</h1>

<p>The basic facts we need to begin constructing a Tengwar mode for
any given language are (a) a phoneme inventory, and (b) whether its
basic syllables are "closed" (consonent-ended, like English and
Tolkien's Westron) or "open" (vowel-ended, like Italian or
Tolkien's Quenya).</p>

<p>Esperanto has 34 phonemes. They are as follows:</p>

<dl>
<dt>/m/</dt>

<dd>The voiced bilabial nasal stop that begins English "mum".
Esperanto writes this as 'm'.</dd>

<dt>/p/</dt>

<dd>The voiceless bilabial stop that begins English "pop".
Esperanto writes this as 'p'.</dd>

<dt>/b/</dt>

<dd>The voiced bilabial stop that begins English "bib". Esperanto
writes this as 'b'.</dd>

<dt>/v/</dt>

<dd>The voiced labiodental fricative that begins English "verve".
Some Europeans render this as a bilabial approximant. Esperanto
writes this as 'v'.</dd>

<dt>/f/</dt>

<dd>The unvoiced labiodental fricative that begins English "fife".
Esperanto writes this as 'f'.</dd>

<dt>/r/</dt>

<dd>The voiced palatal-alveolar approximant that begins English
"rare". Note that this sound varies considerably by English
dialect; the American form is typically a retroflex palatal, the
British Received Pronunciation form front alveolar, and some Scots
dialects use a trilled r. All these forms are allophones in both
English and Esperanto, together with other variants like French
uvular r. Esperanto writes this as 'r'.</dd>

<dt>/d/</dt>

<dd>The voiced alveolar stop that begins English "did". European
Esperantists may use a more dental articulation. Esperanto writes
this as 'd'.</dd>

<dt>/t/</dt>

<dd>The voiceless alveolar stop that begins English "tot". European
Esperantists may use a more dental articulation. Esperanto writes
this as 't'.</dd>

<dt>/y/</dt>

<dd>The voiced palatal approximant that begins English "yoyo" (<a
href="#rye">Rye</a> follows IPA in writing this /j/). Esperanto
writes this as 'j', unlike English.</dd>

<dt>/h/</dt>

<dd>The unvoiced glottal approximant that begins English "ha-ha".
Esperanto writes this as 'h'.</dd>

<dt>/l/</dt>

<dd>The voiced alveolar lateral approximant that begins English
"lull". Esperanto writes this as 'l'.</dd>

<dt>/ts/</dt>

<dd>This is the alveolar affricate that begins "tsar". It is not a
native phoneme in English; English speakers should guard against
assimilating it into /z/ or /s/. Esperanto writes this as 'c',
unlike English (but like, for example, Italian).</dd>

<dt>/z/</dt>

<dd>The voiced alveolar fricative that begins English "zoos".
Esperanto writes this as 'z'.</dd>

<dt>/s/</dt>

<dd>The unvoiced alveolar fricative that begins English "sauce".
Esperanto writes this as 's'.</dd>

<dt>/w/</dt>

<dd>The voiced labiovelar approximant that begins English
"wah-wah". Orthodox Esperanto writes this as a u-breve; the breve
is often omitted, and some reformed orthographies have re-adopted
'w'). It only occurs in dipthongs with leading /e/, /a/, and (in
one exceptional instance) /o/. 
<!-- According to Rye, the exception is "powpo" (stern, poop) -->
</dd>

<dt>/j/</dt>

<dd>The voiced palato-alveolar affricated stop that begins English
"judge" (<a href="#rye">Rye</a> writes this /dZ/). Esperanto writes
this as a g-circumflex combination (often ASCIIfied as g^), but
'gh' is also in common use.</dd>

<dt>/ch/</dt>

<dd>The voiceless palato-alveolar affricated stop that begins
English "church" (<a href="#rye">Rye</a> writes this /tS/).
Orthodox Esperanto writes this as a c-circumflex combination (often
ASCIIfied as c^), but 'ch' is also in common use.</dd>

<dt>/zh/</dt>

<dd>The voiced palato-alveolar fricative that is the first
consonant of English "azure" and second of "vision" (<a
href="#rye">Rye</a> writes this /Z/). Orthodox Esperanto writes
this as a j-circumflex combination (often ASCIIfied as j^), but
'jh' is also in common use.</dd>

<dt>/sh/</dt>

<dd>The unvoiced palato-alveolar fricative that begins English
"shush" (<a href="#rye">Rye</a> writes this /S/). Esperanto writes
this as a s-circumflex combination (often ASCIIfied as s^), but
'sh' is also in common use.</dd>

<dt>/n/</dt>

<dd>The voiced alveolar nasal stop that begins English "nun".
Esperanto writes this as 'n'.</dd>

<dt>/g/</dt>

<dd>The voiced velar stop that begins English "gag". Esperanto
writes this as 'g'.</dd>

<dt>/k/</dt>

<dd>The voiceless velar stop that begins English "kick". Esperanto
writes this as 'k'.</dd>

<dt>/x/</dt>

<dd>The voiced velar fricative that ends Scottish "loch".
Allophonic variants include an uvular fricative as in Dutch or
Arabic. Not native to English; English speakers should beware of a
tendency to assimilate it to /h/. Esperanto writes this as an
h-circumflex combination (often ASCIIfied as h^), but 'hh' is also
recognized usage.</dd>

<dt>/i/</dt>

<dd>The close front unrounded vowel of English "be".</dd>

<dt>/e/</dt>

<dd>The half-open front unrounded vowel of Italian or Spanish
"le"</dd>

<dt>/a/</dt>

<dd>The half-open back unrounded vowel of Italian or Spanish
"la"</dd>

<dt>/o/</dt>

<dd>The half-open back rounded vowel of Italian "lo".</dd>

<dt>/u/</dt>

<dd>The close back rounded vowel of English "crude".</dd>

<dt>/ei/</dt>

<dd>/e/ to /i/ glide, like the vowel in English "tray". Esperanto
writes this "ej".</dd>

<dt>/ai/</dt>

<dd>/a/ to /i/ glide, like the vowel in English "try". Esperanto
writes this "aj".</dd>

<dt>/oi/</dt>

<dd>/o/ to /i/ glide, like the vowel in English "coy". Esperanto
writes this "oj".</dd>

<dt>/ui/</dt>

<dd>/u/ to /i/ glide. Does not occur in English, though it is
closely approximated by American English slang "fooey". Esperanto
writes this "uj".</dd>

<dt>/ew/</dt>

<dd>/e/ to /w/ glide. Does not occur in English. Orthodox Esperanto
writes this with `e' followed by u-breve. In this context the breve
is frequently dropped.</dd>

<dt>/aw/</dt>

<dd>/a/ to /w/ glide, like the vowel in English "Sauron" or
"plough". Orthodox Esperanto writes this with `a' followed by
u-breve. In this context the breve is frequently dropped.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The phonotactics of Esperanto are neither regular nor well
described. The main issue for our purposes is whether closed or
open syllables predominate. On the one hand, almost every basic
word has a vowel ending (indicating its grammatical type). On the
other hand, the (common) objective inflection adds an 'n' suffix,
and Esperanto (reflecting the Slavic languages its inventor was
familiar with) is even richer in complex consonant clusters than
English or Westron.</p>

<h1>Consonants</h1>

<p>With a few exceptions, the consonant inventory of Esperanto is
quite similar to that of English. The exceptions are /ts/ and /x/.
This strongly suggests using a mode as similar to Tolkien's
existing modes for English as possible:</p>

<pre>
 1(0/0) = /t/   2(0/1) = /p/   3(0/2) = /ch/   4(0/3) = /k/ 
 5(0/4) = /d/   6(0/5) = /b/   7(0/6) = /j/    8(0/7) = /g/  
               10(0/9) = /f/  11(0/A) = /sh/  12(0/B) = /x/  
               14(0/D) = /v/  15(0/E) = /zh/
17(1/0) = /n/  18(1/1) = /m/ 
25(1/8) = /r/  22(1/5) = /w/  23(1/6) = /y/ 
                              27(1/A) = /l/
29(1/C) = /s/  30(1/D) = /s/  31(1/E) = /z/   32(1/F) = /z/ 
33(2/0) = /h/
</pre>

<p>We use 25(1/8) rather than the more obvious 21(1/4) because
Esperanto /r/ is meant to be pronounced trilled; this makes it
easier to distinguish the /r/ from the /l/, especially for speakers
of Asian languages.</p>

<p>This gives us full-writing tengwar for every Esperanto consonant
except /ts/. We could write that using /t/ 1(0/0) combined with the
"right silme" sign for following-s (5/C), but it would also be
useful to have a full-written version. So we should slip /ts/ into
one of the gaps. The obvious position is 9(0/8), which at grade I
of series 3 should be a unvoiced dental affricate (IPA theta). /ts/
is not at all a bad fit here.</p>

<h1>Vowels</h1>

<p>We'll tackle the full-writing option first. We need a minimum of
five signs, for /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/. All of these occur in
the Sindarin inscription on the West-Gate of Moria in Volume I,
though not all are shown in Appendix E. In the `Mode of Beleriand',
then, the vowel letters are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>/a/</dt>

<dd>a curl open to the right (like cursive latin `c'), tengwa
(3/2).</dd>

<dt>/e/</dt>

<dd>tengwa 35(2/2).</dd>

<dt>/i/</dt>

<dd>the `short carrier' tehta (2/5), resembling an undotted
'i'.</dd>

<dt>/o/</dt>

<dd>tengwa 23(2/7).</dd>

<dt>/u/</dt>

<dd>tengwa 36(2/3).</dd>
</dl>

<p>We need additional signs for the dipthongs. Tolkien says that
the Elves used two overhead dots (3/4) for following-y; this will
handle /ai/, /ei/, /oi/, and /ui/. He also writes of the u-curl
(4/A in this mode) being used above a full-writing vowel to signify
following w.</p>

<p>Now for the tehtar. For /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/ we can use
the same tehtar used in Westron and Tolkien's mode for English (as
used in the title-page inscription of LotR):</p>

<dl>
<dt>/a/</dt>

<dd>three dots arranged in a triangle, or a circumflex (4/1)</dd>

<dt>/e/</dt>

<dd>an acute accent (4/6)</dd>

<dt>/i/</dt>

<dd>an overhead dot (4/4)</dd>

<dt>/o/</dt>

<dd>an acute accent with a terminating downward hook (4/8)</dd>

<dt>/u/</dt>

<dd>a grave accent with a terminating downward hook (4/A)</dd>
</dl>

<p>How to represent the dipthongs in tehtar? We cannot superimpose
them, as there are adjacent vowels in Esperanto: "praulo"
(ancestor) and "boato" (boat) are examples. Therefore we must write
dipthongs as the full letter for the initial sound with a
following-y or /u/ tehta above it.</p>

<h1>Quenya or Sindarin style?</h1>

<p>We have left until last the vexing question of whether Esperanto
tehtar should be written Sindarin- or Westron like (tehtar over
following consonant) or Quenya-like (tehtar over preceding
consonant). Inspecting words in the Esperanto corpus, it appears
that `open' syllables with final vowels predominate. Thus in the
1.1 version of this mode I settled on the Quenya-like
convention.</p>

<p>However, Erich Rickheit observes: "Esperanto is an inflected and
agglutinative language; one needs to be interested in morphemes,
rather than words. Most of the most common morphemes are closed;
especially, the most common grammatical affixes (-et-, -ig-, -igh-,
-ec-, -em-), and the commonest verb inflections (-as, -is, -os) are
closed. Also, treating final syllables as open would mean that
changing an inflection (say, from nominative to accusative) would
change a glyph not otherwise part of the inflection, which is a bit
of a dissonance."</p>

<p>He continues: "The other useful side effect of going to the
closed mode is that the glides /y/ and /w/ become the glyph, with
the vowel 'hanging on' as a tehtar, rather than being a tehtar when
used as glide and a glyph when used as a consonant; this is more
consistent with the Esperanto use of the Latin alphabet."</p>

<p>This is persuasive. I'm therefore now recommending the Sindarin
style.</p>

<h1>Punctuation</h1>

<p>I have not been able to find any specification of Esperanto's
punctuation rules, but it appears from texts that Esperanto employs
modern European punctuation. It would be nice to have at least
signs for period, comma, exclamation point, question mark, colon,
semicolon, parentheses, and quote marks.</p>

<p>Half of these are attested in the corpus of Tengwar texts:</p>

<p>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>comma</dt>

<dd>pusta or "pause" sign (5/0).</dd>

<dt>period</dt>

<dd>double pusta (5/1).</dd>

<dt>question mark</dt>

<dd>(5/2)</dd>

<dt>exclamation mark</dt>

<dd>(5/3)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Parentheses would look perfectly reasonable in a tengwar
context. Indeed, the visual enclosure of text in parentheses to set
off auxiliary remarks would appeal to the Eldar fondness for making
the relationships between geometric forms in their orthography
meaningful.</p>

<p>Colon, semicolon, and quotes, however, pose a problem. They do
not occur in the corpus. Colon and semicolon probably have to be
mapped into the pusta "pause" sign. English quotes look rather too
much like floating tehta, but French-style guillemets might do.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Here are all the signs and tehtar in the full mode, collected
for reference:</p>

<pre>
Consonants:

 1(0/0) = /t/   2(0/1) = /p/   3(0/2) = /ch/   4(0/3) = /k/

 9(0/8) = /ts/ 10(0/9) = /f/  11(0/A) = /sh/  12(0/B) = /x/  
               14(0/D) = /v/  15(0/E) = /zh/
17(1/0) = /n/  18(1/1) = /m/ 
25(1/8) = /r/  22(1/5) = /w/  23(1/6) = /y/ 
                              27(1/A) = /l/
29(1/C) = /s/  30(1/D) = /s/  31(1/E) = /z/   32(1/F) = /z/

(3/2) = /a/  35(2/2) = /e/  (2/5) = /i/  23(2/7) = /o/  36(2/3) = /u/

Vowel tehtar:

(4/1) = /a/  (4/6) = /e/  (4/4) = /i/  (4/8) = /o/  (4/A) = /u/

Combining signs:

following-s = (5/C, 5/D)  following-y = (3/4)

Punctuation:

comma or pause = (5/0)   period = (5/1) 
exclamation mark = (5/2) question mark = (5/3)
</pre>

<h1>Samples</h1>

<p>Erich Rickheit supplied these samples.</p>

insult his crewmates in Esperanto: "Please call the hall porter,
there appears to be a frog in my bidet".</p>
