<p>
	The last game I played extensively was "Diablo 2" during the year 2000 when Internet finally became affordable in France. I loved that it was a difficult game to master, I loved the mandatory grinding which made accomplishments meaningful. I loved to trade and the economy players invented. 
</p>
<p>
	Most importantly I loved the countless hours spent with my friends and brother, helping each other. When Blizzard released "Diablo II Resurrected" last year I knew immediately I wanted to go back. And I went all in. 
</p>
<p>
	To my delight, my wife expressed the desire to play. This created a need for a second PC in the house. The "Beautiful D2R Machine" project is the intertwined tales of building a PC during a pandemic and slaying monsters with my best friend.
</p>
<p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="d2rmachine.webp" width="2000" height="1500" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom:1ch;"/>	<span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;"><i><small>The finished project</small></i></span>
</p>

<div class='heading'>Working with a bench</div><hr/><p>
   Having sworn off USB, I wanted to build something around Thunderbolt-3. The issues of my previous build, compounded by the DB4 chassis where opening the case required re-applying thermal paste to four panels, inspired me to use a Streacom BC 1.1 workbench.
</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="bm.webp" width="2000" height="1000" style="width: 100%; height: auto; 	margin-bottom:1ch;"/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;"><i><small>Streacom BC 1.1. Both beautiful and useful.</small></i></span>

<div class='heading'>Thunderbolt disillusion</div><hr/><p>
	The workbench turned out to be a sound idea. The Beautiful Machine<a name="back_1" style="text-decoration: none;" href="index.html#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> was working well with an ASRock Phantom Gaming ITX TB-3 so I tried the same setup. The worse nightmare of a PC builder surfaced with random freezes. I tried everything. Updating the BIOS and all the drivers, using the exact RAM parts number found on the QVL, switching RAM, using only one RAM, monitoring temperatures of chipset, CPUs and GPUs, and even enabling/disabling innumerable poorly documented mobo settings. I was never able to figure it out and RMAed it.
</p>
<p>
	I tried something beefier, the MSI Z590I ITX, advertised as a dual Thunderbolt-4 with Display Port pass-through video. One of the ports was Dead on Arrival and I never managed to make the pass-through work. Disillusioned, I ended up with a freeze free ASRock Z590 Phantom Gaming-ITX/TB4 with no support for pass-through.
</p>
<p>
	At this point, I don't know what to do with desktop machines. USB is a mess and Thunderbolt motherboards either don't support video or have stability issues. If I had to redo it, I would buy a ThinkPad and use an external GPU or use a KVM monitor such as the BenQ PD2720U or the GigaByte M27Q.
</p>



<div class='heading'>Finding a GPU, an adventure in the adventure before the adventure</div><hr/><p>
	The hardest part of building the PC in the sweet month of August 2021 was dealing with the worldwide GPU shortage. The perfect one for this job, the Nvidia 3060 Ti was sold out everywhere. It could be found on eBay for $1,300 which accounted for a 350% markup.
</p> 
	<img loading="lazy" src="sold_out.webp" width="2000" height="1098" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom:1ch;"/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;"><i><small>3060 Ti, sold out for the whole year 2021.</small></i></span>
<p>
All I could find was a kind co-worker willing to sell a ZOTAC 1080 Ti AMP Extreme. The thing was a beast weighting more than all other components combined (bench included). It was so massive that it stuck out the back.
</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="1080extreme.webp" width="2000" height="918" style="width: 100%; height: auto; "/>	<span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small>La bete (the beast)</small></i></span>
<p>
 It was not even going to be able to run D2R maxed out but it would be better than the 15fps of an Iris Xe.
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="battlefield.webp" width="2000" height="839" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom:1ch;"/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;"><i><small>Finding which mobo works. Also HUGE GPU!</small></i></span>
<p>
<b>Fun fact:</b> Working with a workbench means you have no "power on" button to start up the PC. The consensus way is to locate the PWR and GRD pins on the motherboard and short them with a screwdriver. Having the MacGyver song playing in the background helps to find the courage to do it. I confirm it works.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, I bought a PC Power Button ATX cable with a tiny button at the end so anybody could turn it on. You can see it on the photo in the lower left near the screwdrivers. It turns the mundane task of turning a PC on into a ceremony. I almost felt compelled to say "Ignition" before pressing it.
</p>



<div class='heading'>DA2 case</div><hr/><p>
	With a working, freeze free PC, it was time to put it in a case. I love Streacom design ever since I got a DB4. This time I went for the DA2. It was a back and forth between black and silver. 

</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="da2.webp" width="2000" height="860" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom:1ch;"/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;"><i><small>Streacom design at its finest.</small></i></span>
</p>


<div class='heading'>Catastrophe</div><hr/><p>
	It was a joy to tinker with the workbench and it sped up experimentations considerably but it is a double edged sword if you lack experience.
Catastrophe ensued when I tried to transfer the workbench build into the DA2. The case is clearly advertised as dual slots...and I had no idea they existed but the ZOTAC 1080 Ti AMP Extreme is a 2.5 slots! Even if I used a hammer, the GPU was not going to fit in.

<p>
By the time I ran into that issue, Diablo II Resurrected was released. I had a PC with no case and wires everywhere which took me back way before 2000. But it worked and we started playing with this setup, crossing fingers the cat would leave it alone.
</p>

<div class='heading'>End of the GPU story</div><hr/><p>
I could have picked a bigger case but I really wanted something tiny. I tried several ways to find a GPU that would fit.  I was on Best Buy website on the lookout for rare restock notices. I registered on all Discord groups I could find. 
</p>
<p>
After a month of searching, I found a craiglist listing from someone who had scored two 3070 Ti in a sale and was willing to part away with the other for a 20% markup. I thought about it as a reasonable "finder fee" and accepted the deal.
</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="quick_check.webp" width="2000" height="1500" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom:1ch;"/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;"><i><small>Let me check if it works real-quick.</small></i></span>


<div class='heading'>Final Specs</div><hr/><p>
  I picked up a lightweight Intel Core i5 CPU since my understanding is that games are not CPU bound these days. The final list of components is as follows.
</p>
<p>
   <ul>
   	<li>Cpu : Intel Core i5-11600 2.8GHz</li>
   	<li>Mobo: ASRock Z590 Phantom Gaming-ITX/TB4 Motherboard</li>
   	<li>SSD : SAMSUNG 980 PRO 2TB PCIe NVMe Gen4</li>
   	<li>RAM : Corsair CMK32GX4M2E3200C16 32GB (2x16G) DDR4 3200 Vengeance</li>
   	<li>FAN1: Pure Rock Slim 2</li>
   	<li>FAN2: Noctua NF-P14s redux-1500 PWM</li>
   	<li>Case: Streacom ST-DA2V2B DA2 V2 SFF Mini Tower ITX- Black</li>
   	<li>PSU : Corsair SF Series, SF750, 750 Watt, SFX</li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>	
Fun fact: What do you do when you assemble the whole PC, move the case and see this tiny thing fall on the table?
</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="whatisit.webp" width="2000" height="1874" style="width: 28%; height: auto; margin-bottom:1ch;margin-right:2ch;"/><img loading="lazy" src="whatisit2.webp" width="2000" height="1939" style="width: 27%; height: auto; margin-bottom:1ch;margin-right:2ch;"/><img loading="lazy" src="whatisit3.webp" width="2000" height="1354" style="width: 38.7%; height: auto; margin-bottom:1ch;"/><p>
It looks like a heat sink that would have somehow fallen from the component it was supposed to cool. A very tiny one (screw for scale). Can you guess where it came from?

<div class='heading'>Let's play like it is 2000!</div><hr/><p>On September 23, 2021 we logged in. And it was amazing. The HD graphics were even better than I remembered them.

<p>
Servers had a hard time to keep up. I was happy to see that Blizzard's gamble succeeded beyond their expectations and that many people still loved Diablo 2. On top of that the developers did an outstanding job of explaining<a name="back_2" style="text-decoration: none;" href="index.html#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> what was happening behind the scene which I appreciated.

The only real issue was the abscence of chat rooms. That was going to make trading difficult. Instead we relied on Discord's Chaos Sanctuary<a name="back_3" style="text-decoration: none;" href="index.html#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> vibrant community.

<p>
I created the character I remembered enjoying the most, an Amazon, intending to make it into a bowazon. I already pictured cleaning the River of Flame with multishot Goldstrike. Vicky made a sorceress because she loved to be a caster in World of Warcraft. 
</p>

<div class='heading'>The game has changed</div><hr/><p>	
	Things went well for a while. We cruised through Normal and Nightmare difficulty. However as we were making progress, I started to notice the game had changed a lot. It was much more vast with new quests and a synergy system. Also both monsters and items had increased in power. This made it exciting since everything was new. It was also weird to find items that used to be good and realize they were now unremarkable. Here is a short selection of "heartbreaks".</p>
<p>
	<b>Goldskin</b> used to be good in Classic D2. Besides giving more gold to help gamble it provided a whooping "+35 all resistances". Also it made your character look like gold which was really cool.
</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="bad_goldskin.webp" width="2000" height="1125" style="width: 100%; height: auto; "/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small>In 2021 players would not even bother identifying an Unique Full Plate Mail.</small></i></span>


<p>Bows, bowazon, and dual leech (life/mana) rings used to be all the rage. Probably the best build at the time. <b>Goldstrike</b> was not only good, it was beautiful to use since it came with a incessant "First of Heaven" on multishot with Wagnerian sound effects.
</p>

<p>In a game where bowazon was queen, the second best weapon was <b>Eaglehorn</b>. </p>

<p>The ultimate item, the one everybody was after used to be <b>Windforce</b>. The screenshot shows me trading one for a <span class="rune">MAL</span> rune, in an attempt to boost my amazon to an acceptable level in Hell.</p>	
<img loading="lazy" src="bad_hydra.webp" width="2000" height="1125" style="width: 100%; height: auto; "/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small><span class="rune">MAL</span> rune for Windforce. An insult for what used to be THE best item in D2.</small></i></span>


<p>A powerful PvP build was the Nova sorceress with which the ultimate shield to yield was <b>Stormshield</b>. Thanks to Wizardspike<a name="back_4" style="text-decoration: none;" href="index.html#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> FCR, the goal was to teleport next to the opponent and Nova it into dust. I collected many PvP ears that way back in the days with the amount of modesty you would expect from a 20-something French kid.</p>

I was pleasantly surprised to see very few scamming attempts. Many people displayed remarkable ingenuity in order to steal your stuff back in the days.

<p>
Above, the good old sleight of hand where a scammer cancels a trade and attempts to rush target into accepting the deal ("my mom called me") without rechecking the item. Originally performed with a ring to look like a Stone of Jordan, people became creative with Emerald socketed shako to pass as Harlequin Crest. 
</p>







<div class='heading'>A new beginning</div><hr/><p>	
Hell difficulty was when the fun stopped. The bowazon had been severely nerfed and did not hold up to my memories. No bow was powerful enough and as a result Vicky's sorceress was carrying a dead weight.
</p>
<p>
In the old days that would have mean starting a new character from scratch. But the developers had the brilliant idea to allow (once per difficulty level) re-spec. That allowed me to renounce bows and embrace javelin by turning the bowazon into a javazon.
</p>
<p>However we still had trouble making progress. Vicky found teleport farming stressful with a fragile one-shotable Sorceress and the javazon had no teleport. So we both created a second character. A sorc for me and, hail to the king, an Hammerdin for Vicky.
</p>

<p>We got much better result with this configuration and started to find really cool stuff like University of Zakarum shield, two <span class="rune">SUR</span> runes and the main part of <span class="set">TAL RASHA</span> set. The forge quest was also kind to Vicky with max drops.

<div class='heading'>The Monarch business</div><hr/><p>	
	With a javazon, a sorceress and a hammerdrin, our team took off. We were able to farm the cow level and Mephisto both in Hell difficulty. It appeared that everybody's first character was a Sorceress. This made <span class="unique">SPIRIT</span> runeword in a Monarch a highly sought after item. Since we found many white monarchs while slaying cows we decided to process them and sell them.
</p>

	<img loading="lazy" src="monarch_business.webp" width="2000" height="1125" style="width: 100%; height: auto; "/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small>A white Monarch about to be cubed to add sockets!</small></i></span>
<p>
We tried to cube them to add four sockets. Odds were 1:2 each time.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the process, the <span class="unique">SPIRIT</span> Monarch was advertised in the WTS section on The Chaos Sanctuary channel. A four socket Monarch would go for a <span class="rune">LEM</span> while a perfect FCR roll easily fetched two <span class="rune">IST</span>. 
</p>







<div class='heading'>Becoming Key runners</div><hr/><p>		
	Eventually the market for Spirit Monarch dwindled. We decided to pivot. I had memories of an unused Black Tower Key<a name="back_5" style="text-decoration: none;" href="index.html#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> asset which was never used in D2. Patch 1.10 found a cool way to give it a purpose. Three bosses, The Countess, The Summoner, and Nihlathak respectively drop the <span class="key">Key of Terror</span>, the <span class="key">Key of Hate</span>, and the <span class="key">Key of Destruction</span>.
</p>
<p>	
With three of each (a 3x3) players could open three portals leading to the most difficult area in the game. Defeating three bosses named Lilith, Uber Duriel, and Uber Izual gave three Diablo organs which when cubed opened a fourth portal to access Uber Tristram. 
</p>
<p>	
There a player would have to face Uber Diablo, Uber Baal, and Uber Mephisto at the same time. If victorious, a single torch granting amazing power would drop. 
</p>

<p>
	These quests were designed to be endgame difficult with monsters immune to all magic which were way beyond what we could achieve.
 Gathering the keys however, and selling them for runes (a 3x3 went for two <span class="rune">Ist</span>), was something we could do. 
</p>
<p>
Our problem is that these bosses were either far down a dungeon or very hard to kill. The sorceress could teleport fast enough but the all mighty Hammerdin was too slow. The solution was to cube our two <span class="rune">Sur</span> into a <span class="rune">BER</span> and invests all our savings into a <span class="rune">JAH</span>. With that we made the legendary teleport-granting armor, <span class="unique">ENIGMA</span>. 
</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="making_ber.webp" width="2000" height="1125" id="ber" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top:2ch;"/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small>Cubing our two <span class="rune">SUR</span> into a <span class="rune">BER</span> was an exhilarating moment.</small></i></span>



<p>
Diablo 2 is unforgiving in many aspects but especially when it comes to runewords. The base has to be the right kind. It must have the exact number of sockets. And you must insert the runes in the exact order. That is part of the thrill but there were many horror stories circulating, with screenshots, that made the process unsettling.
</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="horror_enigma.webp" width="2000" height="1121" style="width: 100%; height: auto; "/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small>The horror. Also saw a JahIstBer</small></i></span>

<p>We must have checked the recipe ten times. Dry run the order and made sure the armor had three sockets. These three runes were all our saving and there was no way to recover if something went wrong.
</p>

<p>Thankfully, everything went well. We now had the perfect keys harvesting team.</p>

<div class='heading'>Farming Keys</div><hr/><p>
With two teleport capable characters we were able to check all three key sources in a game within two minutes. Vicky learned the three types of Halls of Vaught layout by heart. She was an unstoppable Nilhatak hunter able to do runs in 25 secs.
</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="2cats.webp" width="2000" height="1500" style="width: 100%; height: auto; "/>	<span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small>Two cats working Nilhatak for a DKey.</small></i></span>
<p>
Nilhatak was considered by some to be the most difficult boss to kill. Surrounded by a horde of minions, he is a powerful necromancer able to cast devastating corpse explosion which he does generously, targeting his fallen lackeys. This effectively creates an almost impenetrable barrier around him. 
</p>
<p>
For this reason, Destruction keys were initially worth more than Terror of Hatred. In practice, corpse explosion could be voided by wearing <span class="unique">NATURE'S PEACE</span> ring and, had we thought of it, equipping <span class="unique">Tyrael's Might</span> on our merc to provide "Slain Monsters Rest in Peace".
</p>	

<p>
Gathering keys with two players in a game and in a party greatly increased the odds of having a key drop. They were not exactly raining on us but our team of two got more of them than players gathering solo.

<div class='heading'>Torch business and cutting the middle man</div><hr/><p>	
Grinding to collect keys was repetitive and we became tired of it fast. On top of that we noticed that people who bought keys from us went to Uber Tristram, collected the torch and re-sold them with a markup. Rinse, Repeat. The harder time they had selling their torches, the cheaper they were trying to buy our keys.
</p>
<p>
	In a Daniel Plainview moment, we decided to cut the middle-man and made the decision to harvest our own keys and convert them into torches to sell them ourselves!
</p>
<p>
Vicky created a third character, another paladin, and we invested all our savings into making it an Uber-specialized Smiter.
</p> 

<div class='heading'>Our First uber Tristam</div><hr/><p>	
Our first attempt nearly failed. Failing an Uber Tristam is particularly unappealing since you spend nine keys to open portals and get nothing in return.
</p>
<p>
 Our plan was for the Sorc to support Vicky's Smiter which would wield a budget <span class="unique">Heaven's light</span> and wear a  <span class="unique">Smoke</span> armor with a procced <span class="unique">Treachery</span>.
</p>

<p>Collecting organs from Lilith, Uber Duriel, and Uber Izual went ok although we had to tip our hat to Lilith for being a fear inspiring opponent able to one shot us.</p>

<p>But Mephiso in Uber Tristam kicked our ass beyond belief. We almost compromised the only portal when he started to camp next to it and instant kill us upon entry. The sorceress made a hero jump followed by teleport to attract Mephisto away and allow us to land.
</p>

<p>We had badly underestimated the difficulty and quickly ran out of Full rejuv potions. We were ready to give up after 20mn of non-stop battling and dying. In despair, I left the game and offered a gross amount of rune for 40 full rejuv on the Discord channel, hoping to get a fast response. It was a dangerous move since the game crashed often. Had Vicky crashed while my character was away, we could have lost it all as it happened to Wudijo in a now infamous stream<a name="back_6" style="text-decoration: none;" href="index.html#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>To my amazement someone showed up instantly. I will never forget the character name who entered the game, "rejuv".
</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="first_uber_tristam_rejuv.webp" width="2000" height="1125" style="width: 100%; height: auto; "/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small>Rejuv saved our first Uber attempt</small></i></span>	
</p>
<p>
 I brought back the 40 full rejuv and became a cheerleader. To my relief, Vicky managed to attract Mephisto far from its minions and slayed him. 
</p>

<p> 

 Baal and Diablo remained. It was an impressive sight to see Vicky's smiter disappear under a rain of fire. Surrounded by two Uber bosses, mage skeletons and demons, there was no retreat possible. The only way out was to keep on fighting and hoping life tap and life leech would keep up with the damage received.
</p>

No retreat is possible.</small></i></span>	

<p>
After much smiting, Vicky emerged from a pile of burning enemies holding an <span class="unique">Unidentified Unique Charm</span> and two <span class="unique">Standard of Heroes</span>. We had achieved the ultimate Diablo 2: Resurrected challenge and got a torch!
</p>

</p>


<div class='heading'>Farming torches</div><hr/><p>
	We ended up visiting Uber Tristam more than thirty times and came back every time with a torch. It was a lot of fun. Now we were the ones buying keys and selling torches. But we were not finished.
</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="builing_keys.webp" width="2000" height="1125" style="width: 100%; height: auto; "/><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-bottom: 2ch;margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small>Buying keys now. It is the cycle of life.</small></i></span>	
	
<p>Quality of our equipment kept on improving. We made a second smiter to stake Concentration and Fanatism aura. We gave them both <span class="unique">Grief</span> to cut through Mephisto like butter. We made <span class="unique">Chain Of Honor</span> and we did not even need to proc <span class="unique">Treachery</span> anymore. We made <span class="unique">Call To Arms</span> so our life total would sky rocket.
</p>
<p>Despite all our gears, Lilith never stopped being intimidating. She always managed to kill us every once in a while which was pretty cool. This is a good design decision from the developers to have crafted an opponent that cannot be completely tamed even with the best equipment. I like the idea of a beast commanding respect from players well into their endgame.

<div class='heading'>Philanthropy</div><hr/><p>		
	We became really good at collecting torches. Compounded by Vicky's luck allowing her to identify any torch into the most in demand (sorc and paladin) we became rune gazillionaires. And since we liked doing it so much, we offered Uber Tristam services for free<a name="back_7" style="text-decoration: none;" href="index.html#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>Helping people without asking anything in return was perhaps the most enjoyable part of our D2R career. People were reluctant at first, fearing for the torch to be stolen but the Discord vouching system helped to clear out doubts. The first person we helped was named BlizzSorc. I will never forget the torch we got her since it was a perfect 20/20 Sorc.</p>

<p>We also helped people to recover from botched Uber Tristam. Even a portal clogged with the three bosses was not a problem. At this point, our gears had become so good we could jump in and cut through anything.</p>

<div class='heading'>Moonlighting as a Merc</div><hr/><p>	
Over time, our reputation grew and players asked us to batch gather torches for a fee. I could not believe my eyes when one of them dropped 15x3 = 45 keys on the floor. I thought maybe they had found a way to duplicate them. However they refused to pay fees with Destruction keys because they had a hard time to get them. This dissipated our doubts and we took the contract at a rate of 2 keys per torch retrieval.

<div class='heading'>Epilogue</div><hr/><p>		
	Vicky and I took part in so many fun adventures and enjoyed the game more than we projected.
</p>
<p>The most memorable part of Diablo II: Resurrected were the interactions with the other players. Helping each others<a name="back_8" style="text-decoration: none;" href="index.html#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, trying to grab the loot, negotiating prices during trade confirmed Diablo II as a legendary title and a  timeless concept.
</p>

<p>
It also made me reflect about Diablo III and how I felt about it. While it was a fun game, I found it too safe to be enjoyable. Players have separate loot, loots always matching their character class, items bound to the account, and no trading. People were siloed, making it a game played side by side, not together.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe this is what people want nowadays. Maybe Diablo 2 difficulty and savageness belong to another era. Regardless of where the franchise goes, thanks to the developers who worked hard to bring back this great game to my life. We had a blast.
