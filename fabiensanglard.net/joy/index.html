  When I was a child, growing up in the 80s, I read pretty much anything I could find about computers. There was not a lot translated to French. I even read the MS-DOS Version 5 Reference Guide. The cover was dry and the content was not very tasty either.
</p>

<p>To be fair, history was still in the making and there was not much to write about. But the least I can say is that time has made it up to me. There are so many good books now. Reading them is a great source of joy. 
  </p>

<a href="livres.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="livres.webp" width="2028" height="711" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid black;"/></a><span style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-top: 1ch;"><i><small>My favorite computer books</small></i></span>

<div class='heading'>My favorite books</div><hr/><p>
To make it to my list of favorites, a book should have at least one of these attributes.
<ul>
<li>Being well researched. The author will have gathered multiple sources to confirm events.</li>
<li>Not fall into the cult of personality ("looks at this genius") trap. Dictated autobiographies make me cringe. Nobody is perfect and if the work genuinely mentions mistakes, it is a good sign.</li>
<li>Allow me to live something I did not experience (e.g: Ultima Online which France internet prices forbade).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class='heading'>The current list</div><hr/><p>
<b><u>Amiga</u></b></p>
<p> Before moving to PC. I had an Atari 520 STe. I completely missed the beautiful Amiga. Luckily this is a field particularly well covered.

</ul>

<p>Not an history book but noteworthy nonetheless, the "Hardware Reference Manual" is a beauty.</p>

<p>
<b><u>Origin System Inc (OSI)</u></b>

<p>Back in the 90s, OSI was the coolest video-games company. Even their motto "We Create Worlds" rocked.</p>

<ul>
<li>  I never understood how they could end up being acquired. Even less how they could end up being shut down. The MoonGate (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Through-Moongate-Richard-Garriott-Systems-ebook/dp/B07SKKTSNQ">1</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Through-Moongate-Richard-Garriott-Systems-ebook/dp/B08WRTKLJV/">2</a>) series explains it.
</li>
<li>I was never able to experience Ultima Online for financial reasons. All I could do was drool over screenshot in magazines. The tales of Braving Britannia (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Braving-Britannia-Adventure-Ultima-Online/dp/172185388X">1</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Braving-Britannia-Melancholy-Malice-Ultima/dp/B08L681PZM">2</a>) explains it like you just got PKed on day one.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
<b><u>Computer Culture</u></b>
<ul>
  <li>
<b>Kevin Mitnick</b>. Many books were published about the adventures of the famous fugitive in the early 2000s. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Takedown-Pursuit-Capture-Americas-Computer/dp/0786889136">Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of Kevin Mitnick</a> felt authentic.</li>
<li><A href="https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396">Hackers The heroes of the computer revolution</A>. "The Right Thing" that used to be brought up so often by John Carmack comes from here.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b><u>Video-games</u></b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Diablo I and II</b>. I wrote a lot about video-games but I never entered the field as a professional. The tales of Condor/Blizzard North reassured me about my choice. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stay-Awhile-Listen-Legendary-Video-Game-ebook/dp/B00G8UL474">first volume</a> of Stay a While and Listen uses an experiment layout which I hated. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stay-Awhile-Listen-Heaven-Secret/dp/098840995X">second tome</a> uses a narrative structure that is Masters of Doom level masterpiece which I adored.</li>
  <li><b>Prince of Persia</b>. Jordan Mechner's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Prince-Persia-Journals-1985-1993-Illustrated/dp/0578627310">diary</a> from his Karateka and PoP days felt genuine and relatable.</li>
  <li><b>Wolfenstein 3D/Doom/Quake</b>. No need to present the ultra-classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Culture/dp/0812972155">book</a>. If I could pick only one in this list, it would be that one. This is the work that changed my life and made me strive for excellence.</li>
  
  <li><b>Street Fighter series</b>. There is next to no literature about the making of the series. I never understood why, especially compared to everything written in American companies. <a href="https://readonlymemory.vg/shop/book/like-a-hurricane/">Like a Hurricane</a> is a collection of interviews from the people who made, sold, and designed Street Fighter from its beginning.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p> 


<b><u>Companies</u></b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Apple</b>. The fascinating <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537">story</a> of Steve Jobs. Honorable mention to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Kingdom-Private-Story-Computer/dp/0688039731">The Little Kingdom</a> whose only fault is to have been published too early (1984).</li>
<li><b>Nintendo</b>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Over-Nintendo-Conquered-World/dp/0679736220">How</a> the Japanese company took over the world and stayed on top of it.</li>
  <li><b>Cray</b>. You cannot look at a Cray I and not want to learn more about the genesis of these super computer. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supermen-Seymour-Technical-Wizards-Supercomputer/dp/0471048852">story</a> did not disappoint.</li>
  <li><b>The Pixar Touch</b>. The inspiring <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pixar-Touch-Making-Company/dp/0307278298">story</a> of the company that pioneered Animated Feature.</li>
  <li><b>Google</b>. Two great books, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Google-Thinks-Works-Shapes/dp/1416596585">In the Plex</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790">Work Rules</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Microsoft</b>. The first part, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Drive-Making-Microsoft-Empire/dp/0887306292">HardDrive</a>, covers the origins of the company and its founders. The same author covers the rise of Internet Explorer in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Overdrive-Bill-Gates-Control-Cyberspace/dp/0471180416">Overdrive</a>. The Netscape point of view is in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Speeding-Net-Netscape-Challenged-Microsoft/dp/0871137097">Speeding the Net</a>. The making of Windows NT kernel is in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Microsoft/dp/0029356717">Showstoppers</a>.</li>
