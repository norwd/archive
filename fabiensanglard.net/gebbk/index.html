  <img loading="lazy" src="cover.webp" width="500" height="642" style="width: 40%; height: auto; float:right;margin-bottom: 1ch; margin-left: 2ch;"/>  I am pleased to announce that the '<i>Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D</i>' has been translated to Korean!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a surprise to be contacted by Hanbit Media, almost three years after the release of the English version. I had never heard of them and I did not know what to expect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I remember struggling when I wrote the Wolf3D Black Book. Not because I could not find the words but because I had the greatest difficult in arranging text and drawings in an elegant way.
  I like to explain things with visuals so much that I used more than a hundred figures in the book.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   At times it felt like no matter what I tried, there were always gaps at the bottom of some pages. I ended up releasing the GEBBWOLF3D with a bunch of these issues, telling myself it was "not too bad" and "to be expected".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I worked on the DOOM Black Book, my skills had improved. Typesetting was not an after-thought but an integral part of the redaction process. I clearly remember anticipating how drawings would appear several pages in advance. I ended up producing something that to this day I am still proud of. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
 After I shipped the GEBBDOOM, I picked up the GEBBWOLF3D again, flipped through the pages and felt ashamed. What was once "not too bad" was now unbearable. I painfully fixed the issues but left the exercise with the belief that arranging drawing to achieve visual elegance is just as hard as writing words.
  <br/>

  <div class='heading'>Porting from English to Korean</div><hr/><p>
   Now imagine the difficulty of translating that thing. You need to explain technical concepts in a different language and make sure everything is kinda where it was in English. You don't have the freedom to change orders, add, or delete anything like the original author did. I won't even get into flow issues where the language is not left->right and top->bottom. That sound like a daunting task that only passion would allow to be done well. 
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I was apprehensive.
<br/>
<br/>
  I was reassured when I saw the cover of "게임 엔진 블랙 북 : 울펜슈타인 3D". I think its quality puts my minimalist-because-I-cannot-do-better version to shame. It has a Zelda/<a href="pop.png">Prince of Persia French box</a> touch that I love.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is a book that can be judged by its cover. Much to my relief, Hanbit Media has opted for full color and from the exert I have seen, it looks like they have put the effort into typesetting so that pages feature no blanks. So far I have seen a lot of praise on Twitter<a name="back_1" style="text-decoration: none;" href="index.html#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
  <br/>
  <br/>
   It would almost make me regret to have done it all by myself since the quality they reached is so high. And probably exempt of typos!

  Thanks to <a href="https://jhrogue.blogspot.com/2020/10/3d.html">Jaeho Park</a> for translating the whole thing. I hope they give the DOOM Black Book the treatment soon.
