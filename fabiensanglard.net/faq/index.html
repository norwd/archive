  Here are answered the questions I receive the most often.
</p>

<b>What do you use for your drawing?</b>
<hr>
<p>
	I used to use <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">Gliffy</a>. Now I use InkScape.
</p>




<b>What do you use for your comments system?</b><br>
<hr>
<p>
	From 2004 to 2014, I used <a href="http://www.gentlesource.com/documentation/comment-script/">GentleSource comment system</a> with Akismet to detect bots and spam.<br/>
	From 2014 to 2018, I used <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>.<br>
	In 2018, I took everything down because it added little and consumed a lot.

<b>How can I get started with Game Programming?</b><br>
<hr>
	<ol style="margin-bottom: 25pt; margin-top: 0px;">
		<li>Read the source code of a shoot-em-up: They are easy to understand. <a href="http://xout.blackened-interactive.com/ProtoType/Prototype.html">Prototype</a>
		won first place in the first shmup-dev competition. You can find the full source code and assets <a href="https://github.com/fabiensanglard/Prototype">here</a>.
		 If C/C++ is too scary or you are more used to GC environments, you can read my <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/Prototyp/index.php">Java version</a>.</li>
		<li>Write a shoot-em-up: Use Prototype's sprite assets and let your creativity go wild. That's how I started.</li>
		<li>Read books. Mr Elusive (Jan Paul van Waveren from id Software) has a <a href="http://mrelusive.com/books/books.html">list of the best books</a>: Read all of them.</li>
                <li>Read good game engine code: The code reviews on this side are good starting points.</li>
		<li>Practice and write a more complex game. Language doesn't matter, the important is to attempt to emulate yourself.</li>
	</ol>




<b>How can I become a good C developer?</b><br>
<hr>
<p>
	I wrote an article recommanding the best books about C. You can find it <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/c/index.php">here</a>.
</p>


<b>What do you think of C++?</b><br>
<hr>
<p>
I have a love/hate relationship with it. I like the design philosophy to never make you pay for what you don't use. I love to be close to the metal. I hate that it is such a rich environment that some developer can write code that almost nobody but themselves can read. It is the only popular language for which I have never met a "guru". By this, I mean a person able to read anything and understand it right away. Especially when meta-programming is involved the thing can become an unbearable pain to read.
