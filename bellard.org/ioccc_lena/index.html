<h1>Tiny and Obfuscated Image Decoder</h1>

The goal of this project was to write a very small C program
generating a non trivial RGB image. It won the 2018 Obfuscated C Code
Contest as
the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/hint.html">"most
inflationary" entry</a>. Here are
the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/years.html#2018_bellard">corresponding
files</a>.
<p>
This tiny C program outputs a 128x128 RGB image file to the standard
output using the portable pixmap file format (PPM). The output looks
like:

It contains the famous "Lena" image which is used in many image
compression tests.
<p>
The uncompressed image is 12 times larger than the source code of the program which includes the image data and the complete decoder. The actual image data is 1220 byte long, which gives a compression ratio of 40. Using a JPEG-like algorithm would not be enough to reach this level of compression (the Lena image would be barely recognizable). So the algorithm is based on the latest advances in image compression. It includes the following features:
<ul>
  <li>DCT transform with variable block size (4x4, 8x8, 16x16 and 32x32)</li>
  <li>DC and directional predictors</li>
  <li>arithmetic coding</li>
  <li>YCgCo color space.</li>
</ul>
The image data is encoded to a C string with some tricks to make the best use of the IOCCC size constraints. The identifiers were shortened to a single letter to save space. No specific obfuscation was needed as the algorithms already have a significant complexity.

of the Tiny and Obfuscated Image Decoder</a> by Andrew Kensler.
<p>

The DCT transform is based on integer coefficients to avoid rounding
errors. However I had not enough space to precompute them in the IOCCC
entry so they were computed each time with a floating point expression
which explains most of the slowness of the decoding. With comments
from László Papp and Alex Rhatushnyak I updated the program to
precompute the inverse DCT
coefficients: <a href="https://bellard.org/ioccc_lena/prog.c">prog.c</a>. The result is a much
faster decoding while still complying with the IOCCC size
constraints. As the original IOCCC entry, it can be compiled and run
under Linux with:
<pre>
gcc -O2 prog.c -o prog -lm
./prog > lena.ppm
</pre>
Here is the corresponding deobfuscated
version: <a href="ld.c">ld.c</a>, <a href="img.h">img.h</a>.
