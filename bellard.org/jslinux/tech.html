  <h2>JSLinux - Technical Notes</h2>

  <h3>History</h3>

  This emulator has a long history. The current version is based
  on <a href="../tinyemu/index.html">TinyEMU</a> and compiled to
  Javascript or WASM
  with <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/">emscripten</a>.

  <p>
  In 2011 I wrote the initial
  version of JSLinux, the first PC/x86 emulator in Javascript running
  Linux. I reused parts of another of my emulators
  (<a href="http://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>) for the x86 helpers and the
  devices.
  <p>
  After some time (2015), I modified it to use
  the <a href="http://asmjs.org/">asm.js</a> Javascript subset so that
  it is faster with the browsers supporting it.

  <p>In 2016, after having
  written <a href="../tinyemu/index.html">TinyEMU</a>, initially
  a
  <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> emulator, I decided to make
  a Javascript version from its C code by
  using <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/">emscripten</a>. I
  added a <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Virtio">VirtIO</a> 9P
  filesystem inspired by the one
  in <a href="http://s-macke.github.io/jor1k/demos/main.html">jor1k</a>
  by Sebastian Macke so that it is easier to use remote filesystems
  and to import or export files.
    
  <p>Then I found interesting to reuse the VirtIO devices for the x86
  JS emulator, so I converted the JSLinux asm.js code to C and
  converted it back to Javascript
  with <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/">emscripten</a>
  ! With a careful tuning, the new version is now faster than the
  hand-coded asm.js version.

  <p>The next step was to run another operating system than Linux, for
    example Windows NT. A first release of this emulator ran Windows
    NT with QEMU inside the emulated Linux system. It
    was still usable because the x86 emulator supports an x86
    virtualization extension (AMD SVM) used by QEMU.

  <p>The current version of JSLinux runs Windows NT by emulating the
  few missing PC devices (PS/2 keyboard and mouse, IDE disk, dummy VGA).

 <h3>x86 CPU Emulation</h3>

    A x86 CPU with the following features is emulated:
    <ul>
      <li>Pentium class CPU</li>
      <li>x87 with bit exact 80 bit floating point numbers</li>
      <li>PAE support</li>
      <li>CMOV instructions</li>
      <li>MMX and SSE2 support</li>
      <li>AMD Virtual Machine extensions (SVM) with Nested Page Table support</li>
      <li>RDPMC support to read the instruction count</li>
    </ul>
    
    Known limitations:
    <ul>
      <li>No segment limit and right checks when accessing memory</li>
      <li>No debug support (DRx registers)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Emulated Devices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8259 Programmble Interrupt Controller</li>
      <li>8254 Programmble Interrupt Timer</li>
      <li>16450 UART (only used to debug)</li>
      <li>Real Time Clock</li>
      <li>PCI bus</li>
      <li>VirtIO console</li>
      <li>VirtIO 9P filesystem</li>
      <li>VirtIO network</li>
      <li>VirtIO block device</li>
      <li>VirtIO input</li>
      <li>Simple framebuffer</li>
      <li>IDE controller (optional)</li>
      <li>PS/2 keyboard and mouse (optional)</li>
      <li>Dummy VGA display (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>RISC-V CPU Emulation</h3>

    A 32 bit or 64 bit RISC-V CPU is emulated with 64 bit FPU and
    compressed instructions.
    <p>
    Only the RISC-V 64 bit Buildroot and Fedora distributions are now
    available. The RISC-V 32 bit images are still available but no
    longer actively maintained:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./vm.html?cpu=riscv32&amp;url=https:%252F%252Fbellard.org%252Fjslinux%252Fbuildroot-riscv32.cfg">buildroot-riscv32</a> with console.</li>
      <li><a href="./vm.html?cpu=riscv32&amp;url=https:%252F%252Fbellard.org%252Fjslinux%252Fbuildroot-riscv32-xwin.cfg&amp;graphic=1">buildroot-riscv32</a> with X Window.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Performance</h3>

    On a typical desktop PC (2017) with a Firefox browser, the
    x86 emulator runs about 100 MIPS. Detailed benchmarks are possible
    with the integrated <code>vmtime</code> utility.
    
    <h3>Javascript Terminal</h3>

    It is an improved version of the original JSLinux one. It has a
    scrollbar and supports URL highlighting.

    <h3>Linux distribution</h3>

    It uses the <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a>
    and <a href="https://buildroot.org/">Buildroot</a>
    distributions. Custom packages are added for vfsync, qemacs,
    tcc. Optional X Window support is available with
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxbox">Fluxbox</a>
    window manager.
    
    <h3>Networking</h3>

    Access to Internet is possible inside the emulator. It uses the
    websocket VPN offered by Benjamin Burns (see
    his <a href="http://www.benjamincburns.com/2013/11/10/jor1k-ethmac-support.html">blog</a>). The
    bandwidth is capped to 40 kB/s and at most two connections are
    allowed per public IP address. Please don't abuse the service.
    
    <h3>What's the use ?</h3>

    I did it for fun, just because Javascript engines are fast
    enough to do complicated things. Real use could be:
    <ul>
      <li>Benchmarking of Javascript engines (how much time takes your
        Javascript engine to boot Linux ?) and use of new browser
        technologies (asm.js, WASM).</li>
      <li>Learning to use command line Unix tools without leaving the browser.</li>
      <li>Secure file access within the browser (vfsync).</li>
      <li>Running old PC software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Source code</h3>

    The source code of the RISC-V version is available in
    the <a href="../tinyemu/index.html">TinyEMU</a> project. A
    precompiled easy to install demo is also available.

    <h3>Similar projects</h3>
    
    Several other PC or Linux emulators are available. In particular:
