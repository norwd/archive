<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
LibBF is a small library to handle arbitrary precision floating point
numbers. Its compiled size is about 90 KB of x86 code and has no
dependency on other libraries. It is not the fastest library nor the
smallest but it tries to be simple while using asymptotically optimal
algorithms. The basic arithmetic operations have a near linear running
time.
</p>

Features:
<ul>
<li>Arbitrary precision floating point numbers in base 2 using
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754
semantics</a> (including subnormal numbers, infinities and NaN).</li>
<li>All operations are exactly rounded using the 5 IEEE 754 rounding
  modes (round to nearest with ties to even or away from zero, round
  to zero, -/+ infinity). The additional non-deterministic faithful
  rounding mode is supported when a lower or deterministic running
  time is necessary.</li>
<li>Stateless API (each function takes as input the rounding mode,
  mantissa and exponent precisions in bits and return the IEEE status
  flags).</li>
<li>The basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, division, square root) have a near linear running
  time.</li>
<li>Multiplication using a SIMD optimized Number Theoretic Transform.</li>
<li>Exactly rounded floating point input and output in any base between
  2 and 36 with near linear runnning time. Floating point output can
  select the smallest amount of digits to get the required precision.
<li>Transcendental functions are supported (exp, log, pow, sin, cos, tan,
  asin, acos, atan, atan2).</li>
<li>Operations on arbitrarily large integers are supported by using a
  special "infinite" precision. Integer division with remainder and
  logical operations (assuming two complement binary representation)
  are implemented.</li>
<li>Arbitrary precision floating point numbers in base 10 corresponding
  to the IEEE 754 2008 semantics with the limitation that the mantissa
  is always normalized. The basic arithmetic operations, output and
  input are supported with a quadratic running time.</li>
<li>Easy to embed: a few C files need to be copied, the memory
  allocator can be redefined, the memory allocation failures are
  tested.</li>
<li>MIT license.</li>
