<h1>BPG Image format</h1>

<h2>News</h2> 
<ul>
<li>(Apr 21 2018) Release 0.9.8 is available.
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a new image format. Its purpose is
to replace the JPEG image format when quality or file size is an
issue. Its main advantages are:

<ul>
<li>High compression ratio. Files are much smaller than JPEG for
similar quality.
<li>Supported by most Web browsers with a small Javascript decoder
(gzipped size: 56 KB).
<li>Based on a subset of 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding">HEVC</a>
open video compression standard.
<li>Supports the same chroma formats as JPEG (grayscale, YCbCr 4:2:0,
4:2:2, 4:4:4) to reduce the losses during the conversion. An alpha
channel is supported. The RGB, YCgCo and CMYK color spaces are also
supported.
<li>Native support of 8 to 14 bits per channel for a higher dynamic range.
<li>Lossless compression is supported.
<li>Various metadata (such
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format">EXIF</a>, ICC profile, XMP)
can be included.
<li>Animation support.
</ul>

<h2>Download</h2> 

The following archive contains the source code of the <tt>bpgenc</tt>, 
<tt>bpgdec</tt> and <tt>bpgview</tt> command line utilities (for
Linux) and the associated <tt>libbpg</tt> library (read the README
file in the archive). It also includes the source code of the
Javascript decoder.

<h2>Performance</h2> 

<ul>
<li>Mozilla did
 a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160311235158/http://people.mozilla.org/~josh/lossy_compressed_image_study_july_2014/">study
 of various lossy compressed image formats</a>. HEVC (hence BPG) was a
 clear winner by a wide margin. BPG files are actually a little
 smaller than raw HEVC files because the BPG header is smaller than
 the corresponding HEVC header.

<li>BPG natively supports 8 to 14 bits per channel when most other
formats use 8 bits (including most of the JPEG implementations
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP">WEBP</a>). It gives a
higher dynamic range (which is important for cameras and new displays)
and a slightly better compression ratio (because there are less
rounding errors in the decoder).

<li>BPG uses high quality decimation (10 tap Lanczos filter) and
interpolation (7 tap Lanczos filter) to handle the chroma samples in
4:2:2 and 4:2:0 formats.

<li>BPG can be supported in hardware with standard HEVC decoders and
encoders (it uses a subset of the Main 4:4:4 16 Still Picture Profile,
Level 8.5).

</ul>

<h2>Technical information</h2> 

The specification of the BPG file format is
available <a href="bpg_spec.txt">here</a>.

<h2>Licensing</h2> 

<ul>
<li>The BPG decoding library uses a modified version of FFmpeg
released under the LGPL version 2.1 as HEVC decoder. The BPG decoding
library excluding the FFmpeg code is released under the BSD license.
<li>The BPG encoder as a whole is released under the GPL version 2
license. The BPG encoder sources excluding x265 are released under the
BSD
license. The <a href="https://www.videolan.org/developers/x265.html">x265</a>
library is released under the GPL version 2 license. The optional
<a href="https://hevc.hhi.fraunhofer.de/">JCTVC HEVC reference
encoder</a> is released under the BSD license.
<li>Some of the HEVC algorithms may be protected by patents in some
countries (read the <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html">FFmpeg
Patent Mini-FAQ</a> for more information). Most devices already include
or will include hardware HEVC support, so we suggest to use it if
patents are an issue.
