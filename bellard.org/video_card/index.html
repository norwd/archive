<CENTER><H1>A $10 Video Digitalizer</H1></CENTER>

If you are really interested, I can try to find the piece of paper where
I drew the circuit. It was my first incursion in the strange world of TV :) 

<P> The card was plugged on the TV scart connector ("peritel")
and returned the digitally converted signal to the PC by the Centronic 
connector. It was able to digitalize on the fly about 5 images/sec, with a
resolution of 100x150 pixels, in 16 gray levels.

<P> Here are some examples of sources (on a 286 PC) and
digitalizations (all is given "as is").
