<h2>News</h2>

(Jun 13, 2005) First public release
<p>

<h2>What is it ?</h2>

This is not a hoax ! With a PC running Linux and a recent VGA card,
you can emit a real digital TV signal in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF">VHF band</a> to your <a
href="https://www.dvb.org/">DVB-T</a> set-top box.
<p>
DVB-T emitters are usually very expensive professional devices. Now
with a standard PC you can broadcast real DVB-T channels !
<p>
Examples to transmit <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pal">PAL</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECAM">SECAM</a> analog signals
directly to your TV are also presented.
<p>

<h2>What do you need ?</h2> 

<ul>

<li>A good knowledge of X Window and Linux and basic knowledge in electronics.</li>

<li>A DVB-T set-top box able to receive VHF signals with a bandwidth
of 8 MHz (unfortunately most decoders sold in UK only receive UHF
signals). You can use French DVB-T receivers which accept VHF and UHF
RF signals.</li>

<li>A PC with a recent VGA card able to display in resolutions up to
4096x2048 with 8 bit per pixel with a pixel clock of <em>exactly</em>
76.5 MHz. ATI Radeon 9200SE are reported to work (their PLL can
generate every frequency which is a multiple of 2.25 MHz up to 400
MHz). Other VGA cards may work too. If your card cannot generate a
76.5 MHz pixel clock, I can provide alternate images to do some testing.

<li>A cable connecting the <a
href="http://www.epanorama.net/documents/pc/vga_bd15.html">VGA
output</a> to the set-top box RF input. It is possible to use
antennas, but since the transmit power is very low, it is better to
begin with a cable connection.

<pre>
15 pin VGA connector                 9.5mm RF connector
-------------------                 -----------------------
1 (red signal)         <----->      RF signal   (central pin)
6 (red ground)         <----->      GND
</pre>
</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Screenshots</h2> 

Here are some screenshots showing the transmitted pictures. A <a
href="http://www.netgem.com">Netgem iplayer</a> DVB-T set-top box was
used as receiver. The On Screen Display of the set-top box shows the
signal parameters and quality. The pictures were grabbed using a PC TV
grabber connected to the composite video output of the set-top box.

<h2>How to proceed ?</h2> 
<ul> 

<li>Add the following configuration at the end of your X Window server
configuration file (usually <tt>/etc/X11/XF86Config</tt> or
<tt>/etc/X11/Xorg.conf</tt>):

<pre>

</pre>

This configuration won't be used by default by the X Window server, so
you can leave it in your default X Window configuration.
<tt>VideoCard0</tt> is assumed to be the name of your default video
card.

</li>

<li>Launch an X server using this configuration (we assume the display
:0 is your already running X11 display):

<pre> 
X :1 -ac -screen ScreenDAC
</pre>

Your monitor will of course not be able to display anything because
the timings are far from correct VESA timings. Unless you are using a
very old monitor, there is no chance you can destroy it... 
<p>
Wait a few seconds and switch back to the starting X11 display (in
most Linux distributions Ctrl-F7 does it). Then look at the X11 log
file to see if everything was OK (usually in /var/log/XFree86.1.log or
/var/log/Xorg.1.log).
</li>

<li>Download the following gray level image: <a
href="dvbt.pgm.gz">dvbt.pgm.gz</a> and decompress it.
<p>
Display it on the :1 X11 display:
<pre>
display -display :1 -window root dvbt.pgm
</pre>
</li>

<li>Switch to the :1 display (usually with Ctrl-F8 or Ctrl-F9, your
monitor will blank) and connect the set-top box RF input to the VGA
output using the cable you made.</li>

<li>Configure your DVB-T set-top box to do a manual scan on channel 5
(178.75 MHz central frequency). After a few seconds, it should find a
valid DVB-T signal (parameters: QAM 16, fft=2K, guard=1/32,
conv=2/3). Two new channels should appear: <em>Lena Picture</em> and
<em>Balears Picture</em>. Each one should display a nice still
picture.

<li>You can also try the PAL (<a href="pal.pgm.gz">pal.pgm.gz</a>) or SECAM (<a href="secam.pgm.gz">secam.pgm.gz</a>) analog signals. You need to connect the
VGA cable directly to your TV RF input and to use the <tt>dac1</tt>
X11 mode instead of <tt>dac2</tt> (edit the X11 configuration file):
<pre>
...
        SubSection "Display"
                Depth     8
                Modes    "dac1"
        EndSubSection
...
</pre>
Then by tuning your TV on the VHF channel 5 (176.00 MHz image
frequency) you should see a black and white Lena picture.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does it work ?</h2> 

Every VGA card contains high speed <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter">Digital
to Analog Converters</a> (DACs), one for each Red, Blue and Green
component. Here we use only the red DAC. The provided images have been
computed so that the signal output to the DAC is a valid RF signal.
<p>
As we did not want to generate a 176 MHz signal directly, we use the
fact that the VGA DACs generate a lot of harmonics. The real generated
DVB-T signal has a central frequency of 25.71 MHz. Then the second
harmonic has a frequency of 25.71+2*76.5 = 178.71 MHz which is almost
exactly the central frequency of the VHF TV channel 5.
<p>
The DVB-T signal is generated with a DVB-T and DVB-H modulator I wrote
from scratch. This is the most complicated step because the DVB-T
modulation is quite complicated (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COFDM">COFDM modulation</a>). A
custom polyphase filter is used to interpolate the baseband COFDM
complex signal. Then it is translated to the 25.71 MHz frequency.
<p>
I used a patched version of <a href="http://ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a> to
generate a custom DVB Transport Stream containing two DVB
services. Each one contains a still MPEG picture. One of the still
picture is the very nice <a
href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml">Lena</a>.
<p>
For PAL and SECAM, I also wrote a simple TV black and white PAL
encoder. Adding color would be possible, but I am not motivated enough
to do it :-)

<li><a href="http://www.erikyyy.de/tempest/">Tempest for Eliza</a> is
an AM radio modulator also using a VGA card. I got the idea of
transmitting TV signals with a VGA card by looking at this project.

<li>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio/">GNU Radio
project</a> contains source code for several modulators.</li> 

</ul>

I am sorry to announce that the source code won't be available any
time soon.
