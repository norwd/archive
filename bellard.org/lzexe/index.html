What was LZEXE ?</H2>
LZEXE was the first wide known executable file compression for PCs under
MSDOS. It allowed the MSDOS executables (.EXE or .COM files) to be compressed
and then launched without having to decompress them explicitly.

<P>I wrote LZEXE in 1989 and 1990 when I was 17. At that time, hard disks
were small and expensive, and 5'' floppies were small (360K). Since I had
only two floppy drives on my PC (an Amstrad PC1512), saving space was really
an issue.

<P>Although I wrote LZEXE for my own use, I gave it to some friends, and
it was then put on some BBS's. LZEXE became then very famous, although
I did not do anything to promote it. This success was quite unexpected
for me.
<H2>
How did it work ?</H2>
The compression engine of LZEXE was inspired by the method LZSS implemented
in free sources distributed by Okumura (package available <A HREF="okumura.zip">here</A>).
I rewrote it completly in 8086 assembler with a simpler structure and with
an output bitstream allowing a small and very fast decompression engine.

<P>The main problem was to find a way to decompress the executable just
after its loading and to launch it. The decompressor had to be included
in the executable and needed to be very small.

<P>A good source of inspiration was the program EXEPACK from Microsoft
which did a very simple compression on the executables. I used almost the
same scheme. The main point was to decompress the executable while not
using more memory than its decompressed size. It is not so easy because
the compressor must guaranty that at each time during the decompression
the compressed and decompressed parts do not overlap.
<H2>
Versions</H2>
There were only two official versions of LZEXE. The version 0.90 was the
first one, available in late 1989. The second and last one, the version
0.91 corrected a few bugs and adds some utilities. It was published in
the beginning of 1990.

<P>The version 0.91 of LZEXE turned out to be very reliable. Almost no
bug have been found. I never had the time to work on a new version, even
if I had many projects about it.

<H2>Other programs</H2>
LZEXE inspired of course many other people. The most famous clone of LZEXE
is PKLITE. (to be completed)

<P>If you look at the source code of the decompression engine of PKLITE,
you'll notice that it looks like the one of LZEXE.
