<h1>Pi Computation Record</h1>

<p>
I am pleased to announce a new world record for the computation of the
digits of Pi. The following number of digits were computed:
<pre>
  2242301460000 hexadecimal digits (base 16)
  2699999990000 decimal digits (base 10)
</pre>

The base 10 result needs about 1137 GB<sup><a href="announce.html#note1">(1)</a></sup> of storage. Parts
of the result are available <a href="pidigits.html">here</a>.
<p>
Most of the computation was carried out on a single desktop computer
costing less than 2000 euros. The previous records since 1995 were done
using multi-million euro supercomputers.
<p>
Computation time:
<ul>
<li>computation of the binary digits: 103 days</li>
<li><td>Verification of the binary digits: 13 days</li>
<li><td>Conversion to base 10:  12 days</li>
<li><td>Verification of the conversion: 3 days</li>
<li><td>Total: 131 days</li>
</ul>

The previous record of about <a
 href="http://www.hpcs.is.tsukuba.ac.jp/~daisuke/pi.html">2577 billion
 decimal digits</a> was published by Daisuke Takahashi on August 17th
 2009.

<h2>Formula and verification</h2>

The main computation used the Chudnovsky formula to give the binary
result. Then the binary result was converted to a base 10 result. 
<p>
The binary result was verified with a formula found by the author with
the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe algorithm which directly gives the n'th
hexadecimal digits of Pi. With this algorithm, the last 50 hexadecimal
digits of the binary result were checked. A checksum modulo a 64 bit
prime number done in the last multiplication of the Chudnovsky formula
evaluation ensured a negligible probability of error.
<p>
The conversion from binary to base 10 was verified with a checksum
modulo a 64 bit prime number.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

PC used during the computation:
<ul>
<li>Core i7 CPU at 2.93 GHz</li>
<li>6 GiB <sup><a href="announce.html#note1">(1)</a></sup> of RAM</li>
<li>7.5 TB of disk storage using five 1.5 TB hard disks (Seagate
    Barracuda 7200.11 model)</li>
</ul>
Backups were done using 2 TB hard disks (Seagate Barracuda LP model).
<p>
The verification of the binary digits used a network of 9 Desktop PCs
during 34 hours. It could have been done on the same PC as the main
computation by using 13 more days.

<h2>Operating System</h2>

The Linux Operating System was used with the 64 bit Red Hat Fedora 10
distribution. The 7.5 TB disk storage was managed using software
RAID-0 and the ext4 filesystem. Files of up to 2.5 TB were manipulated
during the computation.

<h2>Pi Software</h2>

All the software was written by the author. The most important part is
an arbitrary-precision arithmetic library able to manipulate huge
numbers stored on hard disks. Technical details are available <a
href="pipcrecord.pdf">here</a>.

<dd>The standard SI and binary prefixes are used. For example:
<ul>
<li>1 GB = 10^9 bytes</li>
<li>1 TB = 10^12 bytes</li>
<li>1 GiB = 2^30 bytes (approx. 1.07 GB)</li>
</ul>
