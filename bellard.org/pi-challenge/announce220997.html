<H1>
The 1000 billionth binary digit of PI is '1' !
</H1>

After about one month of computation on more than twenty high-end
workstations and PCs, we can announce that:

<P>
The 1000 billionth (10^12) binary digits of PI are

1000 0111 1111 0111 0010 1011 0001 1101 
1100 1001 0111 1000 0110 1001 0001 0100

[In the more compact hexadecimal notation, we obtain
<BR>
<B>87F72B1DC9786914B15B16FE9218B042A3D410</B>].


<P>

The computation was carried out by using the algorithm described in <A
HREF="http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/plouffe/Simon/MOCpi.ps"> On The Rapid
Computation of Various Polylogarithmic Constants </A> by David Bailey,
Peter Borwein, and Simon Plouffe. However, the slightly faster <A
HREF="../pi/index.html"> Bellard's binary
formula</A> was used.
<P>

A generic parallel computation program was developped to handle the
communications between the server and the clients. It has been
designed to handle huge computations with small communications between
the server and the clients with a high reliability.

<P>

The first computation took 220 days of CPU time, and 12 days of real
time. A second computation was done to verify the first. We computed
the digits starting at offset (10^12)-9 using the same formula. Since
the intermediate results are not correlated, this is a good
verification method. The second computation took 180 days of CPU time
because of a better optimized code. The computer used were mainly
UltraSparc workstations. We used some Pentium PCs, DEC Alpha 200 and
3000, and SGI10000 computers too.

<P>

I want to thank some friends who accepted to launch the program on
some idle computers they managed to find. In particular, I thank
Samuel Orzan, Theresa Lam, Bruno Beaufils, Stephane Munier and Lionel
Ulmer.
