We draw 2.10^6 pixels on a region of 512x256 pixels in 640x480x16. We used
the vesafb driver with a PCI Matrox Mystic card on a Pentium 166 computer.&nbsp;
The time reported was measured with the <TT>gettimeofday </TT>system call.
Hence, the total running time is taken into account.
<P>The test program is available <A HREF="index.html#test">here</A>.
<P>This test is intended to measure the overhead of the kernel space acceleration
against a user space one. The primitive choosen (to draw a single pixel)
is very simple so I assume that this is the worst case we could have. I
tested several different cases (clipping or no clipping in user space,
changing the size of the requests). The pixels coodinates were generated
with a very simple function so that the overhead is very small here too
(see the source code).
<P>When the clipping was done, about 1/4 of the pixels were drawn outside
the clipping rectangle. Note that with kernel acceleration, the clipping
is always performed for security issues.
<P>Here are the results :

<P>This tests shows that the kernel mode acceleration introduces a non
negligible overhead for each command (it is about 3.3 times slower than
user space acceleration for a DrawPixel test).
<P>This is a quite positive result because it means that the overhead of
building the display list, doing the system call and interpreting the display
list takes the time of about two DrawPixel primitives, which is very small.
For example, the X11 server should have in every case a much bigger overhead
in its protocol interpretation.
<P>The optimal request size seem to be about 1000 words on this computer.
It is not very big so the display list handling may not consume a lot of
memory in user space.
<P><B>This test shows that even for small primitives (even up to lines
of a few pixels), the kernel space acceleration can be interesting</B>.
<P>By using inlining in the kernel code, we estimate that the penalty can
come at about one DrawPixel lost per accelerated primitive.
