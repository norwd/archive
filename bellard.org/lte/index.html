<h1>LTE/NR Base Station Software</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<a href="https://www.amarisoft.com/products-lte-ue-ots-sdr-pcie/#software">LTEENB</a>
allows to build a
real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_%28telecommunication%29">4G
LTE</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_NR">5G NR</a> base
station (called an <em>eNodeB</em> (4G) or <em>gNodeB</em> (5G)) using
a standard PC and a low cost software radio frontend. All the physical
layer and protocol layer processing is done in real time inside the
PC, so no dedicated hardware is
necessary. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NarrowBand_IOT">NB-IoT</a>
and Cat-M1 devices are also supported. The software is now developped
and distributed by <a href="http://amarisoft.com">Amarisoft</a>.
<p>
LTEENB is provided with a complete Evolved Packet Core (EPC) so that
it can work without an existing LTE network behind it. In short, it is
possible to use it like a Wifi access point. The EPC contains the
following programs:
<ul>
<li> LTEMME is an MME including the HSS, SGW and PGW.
<li> LTEIMS is an IMS server providing voice (VoLTE) and SMS support.
<li> LTEMBMSGW is an MBMS gateway.
</ul>

<h2>Example configuration</h2>

<h2>Potential use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low cost LTE/NR network simulator. Since everything runs on a PC, it is
very easy to add and test new LTE or NR features.
<li>Educational purposes. Configuring and running a base station is a
way to learn many details of LTE/NR.
<li>Low cost LTE/NR network infrastructure for private or public
networks.
</ul>

<h2>Availability</h2>

The <a href="https://www.amarisoft.com/products-lte-ue-ots-sdr-pcie/#software">LTE/NR eNodeB/gNodeB software</a>
is commercialized by <a href="http://amarisoft.com">Amarisoft</a>.
<p>
A <a href="https://www.amarisoft.com/products-lte-ue-ots-sdr-pcie/#software">UE simulator</a> is
now available. It simulates hundreds of terminals sharing the same
antenna. It uses the same hardware configuration as the LTE eNodeB.
