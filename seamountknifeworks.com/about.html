Seamount Knife Works :: About
</h1>
<br>
<div class="newspaper">
  <p>Thank you for your interest in SEAMOUNT KNIFE WORKS. What follows 
  will give you an introduction to me and my custom knives.
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm <a href="about-phil.html">Phil Wilson</a>,
  a Mechanical Engineer with some formal training in Art. This is 
  an unusual combination but has given me the background to be able 
  to combine the best of form and function into a usable tool. I 
  like to think of it as "Engineered" sculpture.
  </p>
  <p>Knife performance is fundamental in my work. I strive to use the very 
  best materials with the emphasis on state of the art blade steels 
  and heat treating. All of my knives are intended for actual use 
  in the field. I believe in sole authorship, that is the total 
  process of knife making is done by me in my shop.
  </p>
  <p>
  I start with blade steel bar stock and do all the grinding, machining and heat 
  treating. The average knife has about $40 of materials and expended 
  small tools and takes from 8 to 20 hours to complete.
  </p> 
  <p> The standard designs have all been field tested by me under actual hunting 
  and fishing conditions. I also get very good feed back from hunting 
  outfitters, commercial fishermen, avid sports men and women and 
  Chefs who are actually using SEAMOUNT KNIVES. If you currently 
  have or end up with one of my knives I would very much appreciate 
  knowing about your experiences with it.
  </p>
  <p>As the name SEAMOUNT implies I make knives for use in saltwater 
  fishing (SEA), Big Game hunting (MOUNT), and also for kitchen 
  use. Fillet knives are a natural niche for me because I am an 
  avid saltwater fisherman. Salt water fishing knives live a very 
  hard life. They are subjected to an extremely corrosive environment, 
  must be tough, hold an edge while being used on abrasive skinned 
  fish like Sturgeon, Sharks, Halibut and Stripped Bass.
  This interest and specialty has challenged me to use materials
  and develop heat treating techniques to meet these very demanding requirements.
  </p>
  <p> The same materials and techniques can be applied to Big Game Hunting 
  Knives. Environmental changes from cold and dry, to very wet and 
  humid, are common in hunting camps. Edge holding is mandatory 
  because sharpening is very inconvenient to do while field dressing 
  an animal at night in the middle of a driving snow storm.
  </p>
  <p>This year I entered into collaboration with 
    <a href="https://www.spyderco.com" target="_blank">Spyderco Knives</a>.
  They are producing a very good reproduction of my South Fork design. 
  They are using CPM S90V for the blade steel and green G10 for the handle scales.
  It is an excellent knife for the price considering the blade steel and 
  the quality of the construction.</p>
  <p>Two years ago Spyderco introduced another of my designs called the Sprig.
  It is a Bird and Trout knife and useful for small game as well as general fishing
  and outdoor applications.</p> 
  <p>Blade steel is CPM S90V with a green G10 handle similar to the South Fork.
  The blade is ground thinner than the South Fork in keeping with the intended lighter use.
  </p>
  <p>See the <i>articles section</i> and the Spyderco catalog and Spyderco website for
  more information on these knives</p>
