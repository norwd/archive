<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Top">Old Computers Web Site</A></H1>

<!-- <P ALIGN=CENTER> <STRONG> UNDER CONSTRUCTION </STRONG> </P> -->
<P>This is a website that holds information about some old computers (the ones
I own), old devices, and old software. Most of the resources you can find here
are specially related with me (who is building this site). </P>

<P>Most of the information you can find here is difficult to find over all the
net, and my own interests pushed me to write and publish whatever I could. I'd
like to have this as a personal old computer stuff inventory, and for anyone
who needs the information. </P>

<P>I tried to make the site clear. By now, it's all done following HTML 3.2,
and there are no server side scripts. It only has some javascript for the
webring this site is in, and perhaps some javascript from
the free server this web may be in.
All the html pages you can find here are HTML compliant (tested). About
websites, I believe in the 3 clue words: content, content, and content. That's
the main target of these documents. </P>

<H1>Web Site Building </H1>
<H2>English</H2>
<P>I'm not English-native, then this whole website may have some lexical,
grammatical or syntactical errors. I would be pleased if I receive any
note about that; I'll try to correct it as soon as possible, and it will
help me improving my English.
</P>

<H2>File types</H2>
<P>All of the files in this web site exist as MIME types. Some servers doesn't
allow the downloading of files that aren't MIME classified (<KBD>.bat</KBD>,
<KBD>.log</KBD>, ...).</P>

<H2>File parts</H2>
<P>Due to limitations in the free servers that host this site, some of the
files have been splitted into different parts. For example, imagine you have
the file <KBD>compres.zip</KBD> in 4 parts: <KBD>compres_1.zip</KBD>,
<KBD>compres_2.zip</KBD>, <KBD>compres_3.zip</KBD>,
<KBD>compres_4.zip</KBD>. Then, you have to merge
all the files into one. You can use a command like that in <STRONG>DOS</STRONG>:
</P>
<CODE>
copy compres_1.zip /b + compres_2.zip /b + compres_3.zip /b +
	compres_4.zip /b compres.zip
</CODE>
<P>Under UNIX-like systems, you can use the following command under a SH
shell: </P>
<CODE>
cat compres_1.zip compres_2.zip compres_3.zip compres_4.zip &gt; compres.zip
</CODE>
