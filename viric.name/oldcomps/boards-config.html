<H1><A NAME="Top">Board configurations</A></H1>

<P>In my life I've acquired lots of different hardware (It's been cheap, or
I've been given it). Bot most of the times, it didn't came with the parameters
of the device, or the jumper configuration of a board. Then I proceed looking
for them in Internet, but it's so hard to find them. I'll try to put here
enough information for the boards I own which I also have its configuration due
it is a hard-to-find infomration. </P>
