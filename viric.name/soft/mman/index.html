<h1>mman - My MANual</h1>

<p><kbd>mman</kbd> is a small tool like the Unix' <kbd>man</kbd>, but
instead of accessing the system's man pages, it accesses special pages
located in your <kbd>$HOME/.mman/</kbd> (or <kbd>$MMANDIR</kbd>).
It distinguishes each mmanpage
also according to a section number and a name.
</p>

<p>You can view your mmanpages with "<kbd>mman mypage</kbd>", and edit or create them using
a simply "<kbd>mman -e mypage</kbd>". Those pages are meant to be in simple text
format. But if you master
<a
href="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/ups/ReferenceManual/html/manpages.html">nroff-man</a>,
you can use "<kbd>mman -m mypage</kbd>", and it
will store a nroff-man version of the page. Feel free to use section numbers before
the name of the command. Here you have its <em>usage instructions</em>:</p>
<pre>
usage: mman [-e|-m] [section] name
   -e   Edit a TEXT man page
   -m   Edit a troff -man man page
</pre>


<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>I use the mmanpages to store explanations or examples of the parameters
for certain commands I use often. For example, I have a mmanpage for <em>mencoder</em>,
where I have examples of the parameters I usually use when encoding or filtering
video. I'm tired of looking at
very-big manpages in order to find always the same details I cannot memorize, and
there came <kbd>mman</kbd>.</p>

<p>If you use clearcase, you may have a mmanpage called <em>cl</em>, with all
the clearcase commands you need from time to time. The same about some sh
syntax: how to write the <kbd>case</kbd> instruction? I had to look always
at the manual for this. Now I have it in short in the mmanpage for sh.</p>

<h2>Synchronization of mmanpages between computers</h2>

You can use a VCS as
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a>, and keep a central
repository
where you update to and from. If you don't want any VCS, you can use <a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">unison</a>.

<h2>Download and installation</h2>

<p>Download the latest version (GPL licensed):
<a href="mman">mman</a> - v1.0 (The manual is in the header of the
file). It's a script in <kbd>sh</kbd></a> - don't look for
any special filename extension. Put the downloaded <kbd>mman</kbd> in your path.
