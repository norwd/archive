<h1>Bug</h1>

<p><em>Bug</em> is a simple todo-tracking system for the unix commandline. It's
written in <em>POSIX sh</em>, and it only
requires the typical Unix utilities: grep, cut, tr, ... It should probably work
with a small <a href="www.busybox.net/index.html">busybox</a>. The lack of dependencies
was the biggest motivation for its development.</p>

<p>Its database format is a text file containing simple tabbed columns which can
be even hand-edited. It uses $EDITOR for submitting or editing the issues and
for changing states or priorities. It relies on four fixed fields: ID, Priority,
State, and Subject. There is also a fifth free-text field for any other
information you may want to store about the issue. There is no database locking
or notifications, so it's mostly for tracking the user's own issues.</p>

<p>You can look at a <a href="bug-shot.png">screenshot</a> if you want.</p>

# Instructions:
#  1. Your $BUG_PROJECT should point to a file. It will be the database you'll
#     be using. Use an absolute path. It may be, for instance, "~/todo.bug"
#
#  Having the $BUG_PROJECT set:
#  1. Create the database:
#      bug create
#  2. Add an issue
#      bug add
#     Use integers for the priorities. Higher -&gt; more priority.
#     Use any words you prefer for the state
#     Don't break the number of lines until "-- Description --". Write
#     multilines only below that label.
#  3. List the issues (all but description, priority sorted)
#      bug list [ | grep as_you_wish ]
#  4. View an issue
#      bug view <ID>
#  5. Edit an issue
#      bug edit <ID>
#     Change the state, the priority, add data as long as you fix it, ...
#     When I consider an issue is fulfilled, I negate its priority.
#  6. Delete an issue
#      bug delete <ID>
#     Do that whenever you will not need the issue anymore.
