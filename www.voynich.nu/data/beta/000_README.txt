The files in this directory are related to a general reformating 
of transliteration files of the Voynich MS text.
Their maturity is only at beta-testing level. 

The files have been greatly reduced in number after the release 
of IVTFF format 2.0 .

----------------
The Landini-Stolfi Interlinear file in intermediate IVTFF format. 
It still requires checking by comparison against the input file.
It uses the Eva alphabet.
I believe that there is an issue with the Takahashi transliteration
included in it.
