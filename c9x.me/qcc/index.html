<title>QCC - A Quick C Compiler</title>

<article>
<h1>QCC</h1>
<h2>A Quick C Compiler</h2>

<h3>What is this ?</h3>

<p>This is a tiny C compiler, I wrote it in a very
restricted dialect of OCaml. It is in the same family as <a
href="http://bellard.org/otcc/">otcc</a> but will work for
the x86_64 architecture. <!-- My medium term goal is to port it
into the C dialect it compiles, so I can bootstrap the
thing. --> It will generate dynamically linked ELF files for the
64bits architecture x86_64 (AMD64 or IA-32e). It has no
intermediate language and generates code as it parses the C
source file. This makes it very fast, unsafe and
unoptimizing. Code generated sucks, no doubt, but the
compiler is very short and understandable.

<p>Unless your code is dead wrong, QCC should remain very
silent and produce an output file. In its current state, it
will happily compile the expression <code>1 = 2</code>,
depending on the context, the semantics will differ.

<p>I wrote it to learn x86 64bits machine code and ELF files
with dynamic linking. It is very easily extensible and
hackable, you are welcome to add your own set of
improvements.

<ul>
  <li>It is alive:
    download <a href="src/qcc.ml">qcc.ml</a> (~20K).
  <li>Or see it in color
    <a href="src/qcc.ml.htm">qcc.ml.htm</a>.
  <li>See also a small useful example which qcc can compile
    <a href="src/qccx.c">qccx.c</a>.
  <li>The <a href="src/NOTES">NOTES</a> file contains
    some gathered information about ELF and machine code.
</ul>

<h3>Supported features</h3>

The C subset supported features the following language
constructs.

<ul>
  <li>Local and global functions with clean scoping.
  <li>The statements if, while, for, break and return.
  <li>Nested blocks with proper declaration support.
  <li>Forward references (recursion).
  <li>String literals.
  <li>C unary and binary operators with proper precedence
    and associativity.
  <li>Shortcutting && and ||.
  <li>Post increment and decrement.
  <li>Type int (caution, it is 64 bits wide).
  <li>Pointer types (through explicit casts).
  <li>Function pointers.
  <li>External function calls and variables (through dynamic
    linking).
</ul>

<h3>Inner machinery</h3>

<p>Disgusting.

<p>I used the architecture one can find in otcc, i.e. the
dumbest possible. Just parse while emiting code. You can
find a small and quite readable example of this technique in
<a href="https://ghostarchive.org/archive/tzhGF">
TempleOS' mini compiler</a>; reading it will help you
understand how qcc works.

<p>One neat trick I pulled from otcc is the symbol patching
mechanism. Namely, when we don't know the value of a given
symbol yet while emitting code we use the bits dedicated to
this value in the machine code to store a linked list of all
locations to be patched with the given symbol value. See the
code of the <code>patch</code> function for details about
that.

<p>What makes compiling for 64bits architecture harder is
that integer are 32bits while pointers are 64bits. That is
really bad if we want to compile properly because this
implies the need to keep track of types. Fortunately, we
don't want to compile properly so I made integers 64bits
wide. This does not cause much trouble with the ABI.

<p>The layout of produced ELF files includes a single code
segment. It will contain global variables and string
literals at the beginning and code just after. Yes, data is
in the code section. Because we don't know how many global
variables the program will use we patch memory accesses with
the right addresses only when we read the whole input file.
Unresolved symbols will be handled by the dynamic linker.

<p>The handling of lvalues is a bit cleaner than in otcc
since I wanted the parsing to be smooth. This allows proper
post-increment and pre-increment treatment. My solution
makes use of a fun system of late patching of the generated
code, see <code>patchlval</code> for details. A friend of
mine called this <em>speculative compilation</em>.
