Say you are given two integer ranges [a, b) where a is inclusive
and b is exclusive. We would like to write a function that returns
whether the two ranges overlap or not. I suggest you try it out
before reading the rest of the note.
</p>
<p>
We are now going to take a viewpoint on the problem which I hope
you will find original. Formally, the two intervals overlap if
and only if they have (at least) one element in common. So we
would like to decide if the following formula holds:
</p>
<pre>
F := ∃x. x ∈ [a₁, b₁( &amp;&amp; x ∈ [a₂, b₂( 
</pre>
<p>
However, programming languages are really only subsets of the
mathematical language, and most of them won't let us express
the existential quantification. What we would like to find is
a formula <code>Fx</code> that is equivalent to <code>F</code> but free of constructs
that cannot be used in typical programming languages. In
particular, <code>Fx</code> must be free of the existential quantifier.
</p>
<p>
It so happens that this business of eliminating quantifiers is
a cornerstone of automated reasoning, where it goes by the
unsurprising name of "quantifier elimination". Quite often
the idea behind these procedures is to eliminate quantified
variables by forming a conjunction of all the implicands.
Let's see how this would work on our formula:
</p>
<pre>
0: F := ∃x. x ∈ [a₁, b₁( &amp;&amp; x ∈ [a₂, b₂( 
1:  &lt;=&gt; ∃x. (a₁ ≤ x &amp;&amp; x &lt; b₁) &amp;&amp; (a₂ ≤ x &amp;&amp; x &lt; b₂) 
2:  ==&gt; a₁ &lt; b₁ &amp;&amp; a₁ &lt; b₂ &amp;&amp; a₂ &lt; b₂ &amp;&amp; a₂ &lt; b₁
</pre>
<p>
In the last step we considered all pairs (a,b) that sandwich
the variable x and formed the inequalities a &lt; b. By construction,
and by transitivity of ≤,&lt;, the resulting conjunction is a
consequence of our original formula <code>F</code>. In other words, if
the two ranges overlap, then the formula on line 2 must hold.
Interestingly for integers, and in fact for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">total order</a>, 
the formula on line 2 is <em>equivalent</em> to <code>F</code> (take x to be
max(a₁,a₂)). That's one thing we can easily formally verify
using <a href="https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/">HOL Light</a>:
</p>
<pre>
prove
 (`(?(x:int). (a1 &lt;= x /\ x &lt; b1) /\ (a2 &lt;= x /\ x &lt; b2)) &lt;=&gt;
   a1 &lt; b1 /\ a1 &lt; b2 /\ a2 &lt; b2 /\ a2 &lt; b1`,
  EQ_TAC THENL [ARITH_TAC; ALL_TAC] THEN STRIP_TAC THEN
  EXISTS_TAC `max (a1:int) a2` THEN ASM_ARITH_TAC);;
</pre>
<p>
Finally, note that the two conjuncts <code>a₁ &lt; b₁</code> and <code>a₂ &lt; b₂</code>
are simply saying that the two input ranges are non-empty.
If the two ranges are known to be non-empty, then the check
degenerates to <code>a₁ &lt; b₂ &amp;&amp; a₂ &lt; b₁</code>.
