<p>
While browsing information about compilers I found it difficult
to find a formal definition of SSA form (Static Single Assignment).
For whatever reason, it's often under-specified or simplifed.
So anyway, if you are like me and like formal definitions, here it is.
</p>
<p>
A program is in SSA form when:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Variables are assigned only once.
<li> All the uses of a variable are <em>dominated</em> by the unique definition.
<li> The φ nodes are at the beginning basic blocks.
<li> The φ nodes have one argument for each predecessor of their basic block.
<li> Uses of φ arguments are counted at the end of the corresponding predecessor.
</ul>
<p>
The concept of domination is from graph theory: an instruction A <em>dominates</em>
another B when all the paths from the entry point of the program to B go
through A.
</p>
<p>
Please let me know if the definition above looks wrong to you.
Finally, if you want informal examples, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Wikipedia page</a> has
plenty!
