<p>
It has been forever since my last note!  I hereby take it as
new year's resolution to share more about the interesting
thought nuggets I come across.
</p>
<p>
In computer hardware, arithmetic primitives are in fact <em>modular</em>
primitives; this means that the result of <code>a+b</code> is defined as
the mathematical sum of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> modulo a power of 2
(usually, 2³² or 2⁶⁴).  The mathematical structure obtained
is a modular ring in which all operations "wrap around".
It is only a ring and not a field because the multiplication
operation does not have an inverse; to see why an inverse
function for multiplication cannot be defined, observe that
42 is the result of both 21×2 and (2³¹+21)×2!
</p>
<p>
An elementary result equivalent to Bézout's identity
is that any number co-prime with the modulus has a
multiplicative inverse.  In a computer, this means that for
any odd number <code>a</code>, a number <code>b</code> exists shuch that <code>a✕b = 1</code>.
Now there is a particularly cute algorithm to find
multiplicative inverses, and it is what motivated me to
write this note.
</p>
<p>
The core idea of the algorithm lies in an observation I
found quite surprising: a multiplicative inverse <code>b</code> of <code>a</code>
modulo 2ⁿ can be used to find an inverse <code>c</code> of <code>a</code> modulo
2²ⁿ. Let's see how.
</p>
<pre>
ab = 1 (mod 2ⁿ)
  ⇒ ab - 1 = k2ⁿ
  ⇒ (ab - 1)² = 0      (mod 2²ⁿ)
  ⇒ a²b² - 2ab + 1 = 0 (mod 2²ⁿ)
  ⇒ 2ab - a²b² = 1     (mod 2²ⁿ)
  ⇒ a(2b - ab²) = 1    (mod 2²ⁿ)
  ⇒ c = 2b - ab²       (mod 2²ⁿ)
</pre>
<p>
This gives us the inductive step of the algorithm;
to bootstrap it we simply need to find an inverse
<code>b</code> of <code>a</code> modulo some small power of 2. To that
end, one can check that all odd numbers are their
own inverse modulo 4 (and 8).
Putting it together in C.
</p>
<pre>
uint32_t mulinv(uint32_t a) {
    uint32_t b = a;   /* 1/a mod 2² */
    b *= 2 - a*b;     /* 1/a mod 2⁴ */
    b *= 2 - a*b;     /* 1/a mod 2⁸ */
    b *= 2 - a*b;     /* 1/a mod 2¹⁶ */
    b *= 2 - a*b;     /* 1/a mod 2³² */
    return b;
}
</pre>
<p>
For those really eager for performance, it turns
out that <code>b = 3*a ^ 2</code> is a cute initialization 
by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0328">Peter Montgomery</a> which yields an inverse
of <code>a</code> modulo 2⁵ and allows to cut one refinement
step!
