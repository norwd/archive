<p>
I recently hacked together a <a href="../yacc/index.html">small yacc</a> for C.  Initially, I was programming
as if I lived in the future and performance was not a problem.
However, with this LALR state generation you can't be <em>too</em>
silly, as I soon discovered.  Processing this <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y.html">C89 grammar</a>
took around 8 minutes, that was not really acceptable as bison could deal with
it in a fraction of second!  After eliminating a few massive
performance hogs (sorted array to represent a set, loop invariant
in a loop), I was processing the above C grammar in 5 seconds.
Much better!  Then comes my point, at that time the profiler was saying
that my code was fairly fast and accounted for less than a second
of runtime.  The issue turned out to be in my use of malloc/free
in the libc.  I used the following pattern:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Allocate initialize some memory to store a temporary,
<li> if condition C is true, store the pointer
<li> otherwise, free the memory.
</ul>
<p>
The case 3 happened much more often than the case 2 so I thought
that glibc's allocation code would simply give me the same
block all the time.  Switching to the scheme below got
me a 5x speedup, so I guess I was wrong!
</p>
<ul>
<li> Initialize a statically allocated object A,
<li> if condition C is true, allocate some memory and copy A to it,
    then store the pointer
<li> otherwise, do nothing.
</ul>
<p>
The conclusion I can draw is
that objects likely to be short-lived should really <em>not</em> be
allocated dynamically.  This makes me wonder how, for instance,
C++'s RAII and Rust's automatic liveness mechanisms handle this
kind of performance problems.  The speed of my yacc is now similar
to bison's after only 10% of the code was changed.  This proves
the point that, instead of designing for speed, we should design
for simplicity and then, improve.
