Because of a misuse of an archiving command I had to delete more
than 40,000 files polluting my home directory.  The <em>UNIX way</em>
should make it easy because the decompression program can output
the list of files it extracted.  Unfortunately, it turned out to
be surprisingly hard for at least two reasons: first 40,000 files
is a lot and second, files used funny characters (white-spaces,
dashes at the beginning, patheseses, etc.). After some Googling,
here is the final command I used, phew.
