<p>
I would like to share some thoughts I had about tagged data.  Sum types and
such are getting really common in mainstream languages, they are usually
implemented using what I'll call a <em>tag</em> field.  A tag is a small
number that indicates what is the kind of the data considered.  For example,
in C, we often use the following idiom to mimic sum types:
</p>
<pre>
struct Fruit {
	enum {
		FruitNone, /* invalid fruit */
		FruitApple,
		FruitBanana,
		FruitCherry,
	} kind;
	union {
		struct Apple apple;
		struct Banana banana;
		struct Cherry cherry;
	} u;
};
</pre>
<p>
Like in the example, most of the programming languages represent the tag
using a machine integer.  However, if you are programming with high space
constraints it might be worth thinking more about the appropriate
representation of the tag field.
</p>
<p>
Let's say that you want a tagged structure that can be either
one integer of type A in the range [0-255] or integers of type
B, C, and D that lie in the range [0-63], then, because there
are 4 different cases, the tag field needs to be at least 2 bits
long, and because the type A needs at least 8 bits (8 bits
represent at most
  2<sup>8</sup>
= 256 values), the whole tagged
data-structure would need at least 8+2 = 10 bits for storage.
</p>
<p>
The point is now that the whole reasoning above assumes that
the tag bit-width is <em>constant</em>, but in the above case it is
actually smarter to have a variable bit-width for the tag.  Here
is why: if we use the tag 0 to represent the kind of data A, and
3, 5, 7 to represent respectively the kinds B, C, and D, then
we use only 1 bit for the tag in the A case and 3 bits in all
the other cases.  So instead of using 10 bits of storage as
above we use max(8+1,6+3) = 9 bits!  (Note that the above works
because 3, 5, and 7 have 1 as least significant bit, so they
are never confused with the A kind.)
