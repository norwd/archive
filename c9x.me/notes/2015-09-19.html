<p>
The x64 architecture is better than i386 in many regards but one surprise
it reserved to programmers
is that <em>immediates</em> remain 32 bits constants instead of being
promoted to 64 bits like everything else.  In case you do not know it
already, an immediate is a constant in an instruction, for example,
if you want to add N to the register rax, you would write
<code>addq $N, %rax</code>. And in that case, we say that N is an immediate.
</p>
<p>
Because immediates are restricted to be only 32 bits long, it is impossible
to add
  2<sup>33</sup>
to rax using
one instruction only.  One has to load the big constant in another register
first (say rbx), and then perform the addition, like so:
<code>addq %rbx, %rax</code>.
This brings us to the following question, how does one load a constant into
a 64 bits register?
The answer to this is simple, if you do not care about the code size.
But if you do, there are actually three different ways!
</p>
<p>
First, like most 64 bits instruction sets that allow operating 32 bits
sub-registers, x64 zeroes the high bits of the larger parent 64 bits
register for any 32 bits operation.  (If you
wonder why, lookup data-dependencies in computer architecture books.)
So for instance, when the machine executes <code>movl $42, %eax</code>, the high
bits of rax will be set to 0, and the full rax register will contain the
value 42.  This is our first way to load a value, it is also the
cheapest way and uses 5 bytes only.
</p>
<p>
Because 32 bits operations are zero-extended, the previous technique
is unsuitable to load a negative value into a 64 bits register.  In that
case we have to mention rax explicitely in the instruction: <code>movq
$-42, %rax</code>.  On x64, mentioning a full width register costs you
two extra bytes (one of them is the REX prefix, required for all 64 bits
instructions).  So that gives us the second most economical load
instruction, it uses 7 bytes.
</p>
<p>
Finally if the constant to load does not fit in 32 bits, one has to
use the only x64 instruction with a 64 bits immediate.  In
AT&amp;T syntax we write <code>movabsq $4294967296, %rax</code>.  It
really is a last-resort option because that instruction uses 10 bytes!
</p>
<p>
These three cases give us the following rules for compiling constant
loads into rax on x64.  (The same works for any other integer register.)
</p>
<ul>
<li> When
    0 ≤ N &lt; 2<sup>32</sup>,
    use <code>movl $N, %eax</code> (5 bytes).
<li> When
    -2<sup>31</sup> ≤ N &lt; 0,
    use <code>movq $N, %rax</code> (7 bytes).
<li> Otherwise, use <code>movabsq $N, %rax</code> (10 bytes).
</ul>
<p>
Isn't that crazy?
