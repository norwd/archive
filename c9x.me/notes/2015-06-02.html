Here is a short note for those who have trouble remembering Russell's
Paradox or the definition of the Y combinator in lambda-calculus.
I will expose here one observation that allows you to remember just one of
the two and recover the other.  The actual link between these two notions
prevents the lambda-calculus from serving the purpose Church had for it: 
giving a formal basis to mathematics.  Fortunately the lambda-calculus
found another application not any less important than grounding mathematics:
it describes universal computations.
</p>
<p>
Russell's Paradox considers the set R = { X | X ∉ X }
of sets that do not belong to themselves.  Now if such set exists, R ∈ R if and only
if R ∉ R, and we have a contradiction.   Let us encode this reasoning
in lambda-calculus, we start by observing that sets can
be represented by their characteristic function: a function returning
1 for all members of the set and 0 for the others.  Assume that
we represent the negation using a function N.  Then, we can define
the set R in lambda-calculus by the following characteristic function:
</p>
<pre>
R = λ x. N (x x)
</pre>
<p>
Let's observe what happens when we ask if R is in itself:
We form <code>Y = R R</code> (that is exactly the Y combinator) and by one
application of beta-reduction, we get <code>N (R R) ≡ N Y</code>.
</p>
<p>
We just found a fixpoint of N.  In set theory we had a fixpoint of
negation, but negation does not have fixpoint, hence the paradox.  In the
lambda-calculus case, we get out of this with a trick: if N has no fixpoint,
the computation we get by applying these characteristic functions never
terminates, it <em>diverges</em> and we face an ever-running program that
never gives us the answer if R is in itself or not.
