<h3>A collection of small harmless programs</h3>

<p>
Some bits I wrote in C. They are all very small programs in one C file.<br />
Programs here are in public domain.
Some of them can be compiled using Tom Duff's <a
href="http://www.iq0.com/duffgram/com.html"><tt>com</tt></a> program.

<p><table border=0 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=0>

<!--
<tr>
<td><a href=rev.c><tt>rev.c</tt></a>
<td>rev is a silly program reversing the lines of files given as argument.
-->

<tr>
<td><a href="romint.c"><tt>romint.c</tt></a>
<td>romint deals with roman numerals. To convert an arabic number into a roman
one, use '-r', to do the converse use '-a'.

<tr>
<td><a href="calc.c"><tt>calc.c</tt></a>
<td>calc is a tiny C99 integer desktop calculator. It computes the result of
simple arithmetic expressions.  I wrote it to use the Shunting-yard algorithm
of E. Dijkstra to parse mathematical expressions. Very few operations are
supported (+ - * %), but it is quite small. See also <tt>eexp.c</tt>.

<tr>
<td><a href="hanoi.c"><tt>hanoi.c</tt></a>
<td>hanoi will solve the classical problem of the towers of Hanoi with N disks.

<!--
<tr>
<td><a href=blkscr.c><tt>blkscr.c</tt></a>
<td>blkscr will switch the current X11 display off, it uses the DPMS extension
which is bundled in most modern distributions of the X11 system. Its action
can be programmed in the future by using the '-t' option. (<em>Note that
it must be linked with libX11 and libXext</em>)
-->

<tr>
<td><a href="pi.c"><tt>pi.c</tt></a>
<td>pi will compute many digits of pi using a spigot algorithm by Rabinowitz
and Wagon. Use the <b>-n</b> option to specify the number of digits
needed. It will work at a very decent speed for the first hundreds of
digits. The output of the program for '-n 100000' can be seen <a
href="pi.txt">here</a>.

<tr>
<td><a href="permut.c"><tt>permut.c</tt></a>
<td>permut will display the list of all permutations of N objects, where
N is a parameter specified at run time as the only option of the permut
program.<!-- The algorithm is explained in details on <a href=permut.htm>this
page</a>.-->

<tr>
<td><a href="avl.c"><tt>avl.c</tt></a>
<td>This C file is a simple recursive (for most functions)
implementation of balanced trees by G. M. Adelson-Velskii and E. M.
Landis. I rewrote it from scratch to enjoy a copyright free, public
domain implementation of this useful data structure. One basic test
program is also available: <a href="avltest.c"><tt>avltest.c</tt></a>.
This is still work in progress. <b>BUG: On 01/22/2016 I fixed a
problem in the ins function!</b>

<tr>
<td><a href="spline.c"><tt>spline.c</tt></a>
<td>This short C file is a trivial implementation of cubic Hermite
splines in dimension D. This is typically used to find a smooth curve
interpolating a given set of points. An example X11 program using it is
available here: <a href="xspline.c"><tt>xspline.c</tt></a>. See also the
<a href="xspline.png">screenshot</a>.

<tr>
<td><a href="serve.c"><tt>serve.c</tt></a>
<td>This program is a simple one time use HTTP server convenient to
move a file between computers in a user friendly way. It takes a
parameter <b>-n</b> to indicate the maximum number of times the file
can be downloaded, a negative value means no limit. From the
downloader's point of view, a 'Save as' dialog box is displayed with a
hint for the file name.

<tr>
<td><a href="q.c"><tt>q.c</tt></a>
<td>This program when compiled will simply print its source code. It
is not exactly portable C since it relies on ASCII as the character
encoding used. There are C one-liners that use printf, this one does
not use it. I guess we could make it shorter, though. This kind of
program is commonly called Quine.

<tr>
<td><a href="earth.c"><tt>earth.c</tt></a>
<td>earth is an animated wallpaper for X11. It will display our planet
with proper lighting depending on the current time. In its default
mode it will open a new window to render, use <b>-r</b> to render in
the root window instead. In window mode, you can spin the earth using
left and right arrows, more details are provided on top of the C file.

<tr>
<td><a href="hilbert.c"><tt>hilbert.c</tt></a>
<td>This will create a PostScript file displaying one iteration of
Hilbert's curve construction. I did this starting from the visual
pattern of Hilbert's curve and reverse engineering the algorithm. For
example, the output of the program for the seventh curve yields the
following <a href="hilbert7.pdf">rendering</a> (converted to PDF via
<tt>ps2pdf</tt>).

<tr>
<td><a href="algsum.c"><tt>algsum.c</tt></a>
<td>algsum computes one polynomial zeroing the sum of two algebraic
integers. The two input algebraic integers are given as monic
polynomials which zeroes them; for instance "i" is given as "xÂ² + 1".
The algorithm used is directly based on the proof that algebraic
integers form a ring. To get a short description of the input format,
see the C file's header.

<tr>
<td><a href="subs.c"><tt>subs.c</tt></a>
<td>subs extracts all substrings of a given length in a text.  I
use it combined with sort and uniq to find repetitive patterns in
some code I would like to submit to the IOCCC.

<tr>
<td><a href="eexp.c"><tt>eexp.c</tt></a>
<td>eexp was a way for me to experiment with LR parsing table generation.
I defined a small SLR(1) grammar for arithmetic expressions and built the
parsing tables by hand.  They are packaged in this program that implements
a minimal infix notation desk calculator.

<tr>
<td><a href="cube.c"><tt>cube.c</tt></a>
<td>A fun program that displays a spinning cube with ascii art in your terminal.
You can customize to rotation speed with three command line parameters, it is
also possible to change the "color" of each face in the source code.  The
technique used is simple raycasting.

<tr>
<td><a href="mprobe.c"><tt>mprobe.c</tt></a>
<td>This is an xbiff program for the command line, it is best used in a
dedicated terminal or in a tmux window.  The ASCII art for the mailbox
is really miserable so feel free to submit me improvements...  Just list
all the mbox files you want to monitor as arguments.

<tr>
<td><a href="markov.c"><tt>markov.c</tt></a>
<td>Generates gibberish using Markov chains learned from an input text.
Many typographical conventions are not handled properly and I am not sure
how correct this program is...  If you want to have some fun, use books
from the Gutenberg project as learning sources.  The compilation requires
<a href="avl.c"><tt>avl.c</tt></a>.

<tr>
<td><a href="epig.c"><tt>epig.c</tt></a>
<td>Prints one epigram from Alan Perlis' Epigrams on Programming.  Alan
Perlis was the first Turing award recipient.
