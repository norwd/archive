<title>irc.c - A Minimal Curses IRC Client</title>

  <div class="container">

    <h1>irc.c</h1> <h2>A Minimal Curses IRC Client</h2>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: right">
    <q> https://c9x.me/irc/ is boner-inducing to be honest </q><br/>
    <span style="font-style: italic">Evil_Bob</span>

    <p> Feeling the need to have a trivial IRC client usable in a tmux session
    on remote servers I wrote <tt>irc.c</tt>. This client was designed
    with simplicity in mind, yet it is complete enough to fulfill
    my usability constraints.

    <p> The suckless client <a href="http://tools.suckless.org/sic">sic</a>
    provides a good tiny irc client but it is a bit too hardcore
    to use it on a daily basis. First, sic input is driven by a
    standard <code>fgets</code> and hence, no line editing goodies
    are supported except the ones provided by the tty kernel driver (^U
    ^H and friends). Second, sic will mess up the output if a
    message appears while typing a line. Third, sic does not
    multiplex channels (but it is a feature!). Finally, I wanted my
    client to provide infinite scrollback.

    <h3>Features</h3>

    <p> The <tt>irc.c</tt> client is, as its name implies, a single C
    file which implements a usable IRC client. The display mechanism
    uses any standard curses library. It should work with any curses
    implementation (I tested on Linux and BSD).

    <p> The client currently features
    <ul><li>infinite scrollback;
        <li>automatic reconnection;
        <li>utf8 support (inputting is still to do);
        <li>line editing (emacs like keybindings);
        <li>activity markers;
        <li>logging;
        <li>terminal resizes (inside an xterm).
    </ul>

    <p> Keeping feature set as small as possible and, yet, remaining
    usable was the main challenge when designing this client.
    Keeping it simple makes it safe and easy to understand and hack.

    <h3>Fetching</h3>

    <ul><li><code>git clone git://c9x.me/<a href="http://c9x.me/git/irc.git">irc.git</a></code>
    </ul>

    <h3>Compiling</h3>

    <p> It used to be simple to compile but lately I had to add a
    bunch of flags to force various OSes to compile it.  After
    cloning, you should be able to simply run
<pre>
 make
</pre>

    <p> If the linker complains, you might want to change
    the curses library flag to <code>-lcurses</code>.  On
    Debian/Ubuntu, some warnings might be displayed about
    <code>setcchar</code> and <code>wadd_wch</code>, they are
    harmless.

    <h3>Copying</h3>

    <p> I put this program in public domain, do whatever you want
    with it.  Please let me know if by some unfotunate events, this
    became your IRC client.
