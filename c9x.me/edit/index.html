<h2>Vi + Acme = â˜º</h2>

<p> <b>Disclaimer:</b> This software is not ready.  I am using it
and it is stable but I still have to make it <em>feel great</em>,
if you have suggestions I would be glad to take them.  I wrote <a
href="ideas.txt">a list</a> of work that I will attempt in the future.

<p> I like Acme a lot, but without vi keybindings, I cannot edit text.
So I tried to mix the two together.  I first implemented vi's command
language as described by POSIX.  Then I tried to mix some Acme features
by allowing the editor to start external processes and asynchronously
get their output into an edit buffer.  The file system stuff that is
very specific to Acme is not implemented, mainly because it is a pain
on a Unix like OS.


<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p> When started, use the regular vi keybindings to edit the text in the
main window, you can load one file by passing it as argument.  To save
the opened file, use ^W.

<p> To open another file without quitting, open the <em>tag window</em>
using ^T.  The focus is now on the tag window, you can edit it just like
the main window using vi keybindings.  Some text is already present in the
tag, go to the line starting with "Get" and append the name of the file
you want to open.  Once done, exit insertion mode and press Tab on the
line.  The file should now be loaded in the main window.

<p> Similarly to look for a certain string, use the "Look" command in the
tag window.  To find the subsequent matches, use the regular "n" command
of vi.

<p> If you press tab on a line that does not start by a builtin command
it is executed in a shell.  The syntax for commands follows Acme's conventions,
i.e. it understands the sigils <code>|&lt;&gt;</code>.  To select some text,
use the "y" vi command, or the left button on the mouse.

<p> You can close the tag window anytime using ^T again.  To quit, use ^Q.
For more details on the possible commands and keybindings, read the files
<code>vicmd.w</code> and <code>exec.c</code>.

<h3>Differences with Vi</h3>
<ul>
<li>"dd" is not implemented, use "d_"
<li>"cw" will not work as in vi, use "ce" or "cl"
<li>"r" is not implemented, use "cl"
<li>"J" is not implemented, use "0i Backspace"
<li>autoindent is always on
<li>"/" does not work, see the above section for search
</ul>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p> Clone the repository <code>git://c9x.me/ed.git</code> for the latest
changes.  You can also <a href="http://c9x.me/git/ed.git">browse</a> the repository.

<p> Compile with GNU make, you will also need cweb (as provided by
most LaTeX distributions) because one file is written in literate
programming.  A <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/cweb.html">minimal
package</a> is available on Knuth's webpage, note that it is a tarbomb!

<p> For ease of reading of the command definition code, run
<pre>
cweave vicmd; tex vicmd
xdvi vicmd.dvi
</pre>

<p> The patches listed below are contributed by users, they can be
applied with the <code>git apply</code> command.  I will do my
best to make sure they always fit the current version.

<ul>
<li> <a href="patches/tabs.diff">tabs.diff</a> (07/13/21)
  &mdash; Replaces the vertical splitting mechanism with tabs. The
  keybindings "^L + h/l" now switch tabs. Author:

<li> <a href="patches/wintitle.diff">wintitle.diff</a> (07/10/15)
  &mdash; Change the title of the editor window to reflect the
  name of the file that is currently edited.

</ul>

<h3>Demo</h3>
<p> The following video shows some features of the current version.  To
execute commands, I move the cursor on the command line and hit Tab.
If you checkout the latest version, the look of the editor is slightly
nicer and there is support for multiple windows (commands New and Del).
