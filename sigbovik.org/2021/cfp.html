	<h1>SIGBOVIK 2021 submission</h1>
	<p>Note that this is the appropriate way to submit papers but <i>not</i> reviews, triple-blind or otherwise.  See the conference page for details on <i>that</i> process: <a href="http://sigbovik.org/2021">sigbovik.org/2021</a></p>
	<p>By submitting to SIGBOVIK 2021, I solemnly affirm all of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>My submission does not have page numbers.</li>
		<li>I have the rights to use all assets that appear in my submission, and hereby grant The Association for Computational Heresy an unlimited and transferable license to redistribute my submission in its entirety.</li>
		<li>If I choose to present this or other work at the SIGBOVIK conference, I grant The Association for Computational Heresy permission to record my presentation(s) for unlimited distribution.</li>
		<li>My submission really does not have page numbers. Not even a little bit.</li>
		<li>Page numbers are only permitted if they are really necessary for some incredibly niche joke. We're dead serious.</li>
	</ul>
