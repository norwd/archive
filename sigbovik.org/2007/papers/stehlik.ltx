\begin{abstract}
Indeed, Turing Machines are too darn abstract.  This
paper introduces a concrete (desiccated turds are pretty hard)
model of computation that is widely available (we're still working
on certain countries), inexpensive, and moderately durable.  With a
nod toward sustainability, we note with pride that TPTM's are
imminently sustainable (unless it's raining, or a sudden bout of
incontinence occurs) and recyclable.  It should also be noted that,
if widely adopted as a computational device, TPTM's could provide a
viable answer to what to do with those millions of disposable diapers.

Of course, designing the read-write head involves adherence to many
norms, some of which are cultural (we propose left-handed TPTM's
for India, for example).  In addition, TPTM's give new meaning to
the phrase ``that proof stinks''.  Further work involves
investigation of portability (and potty-ability) issues.
