Title:
Crash n' Compile: A formalization and empirical study of developer
productivity and software quality through intoxication

Abstract:
The CrashNCompile process has become a topic of increasing interest in
our community, though up to this point it has been discussed in an
informal manner. In this research, we formalize the rules of the
CrashNCompile process using an operational semantics. We verify the
correctness and termination of these rules through observation and
wavy-hand-proofs. In this study, we analyze the impact of the
CrashNCompile process on developer productivity and software quality.
We also analyze the many variants of the CrashNCompile process,
including choice of language, compiler, and intoxicating beverage. We
conclude by showing that "Team Distraction", a team comprised entirely
of people with "fuzzy" majors, does indeed have an impact on the
quality of the code produced, though it may in no way reflect the
original requirements.
