	<p>"Oh, there's absolutely no need to worry! The transportation system is rigorously tested and 100% safe!"</p>

	<p>Q smacks the side of the tube for emphasis. It lets out another burst of air, this one suspiciously like someone coughing.</p>

	<p>"But if you're still really worried... This is just between you and me okay?" Q leans in, eyes darting around before they whisper in your ear. "It's really just a hyperlink to the submissions site with a little flavor text. The system's even hosted on easychair! Very standard stuff. The webmaster just wanted to throw in some theatrics." When they pull away, Q has a bright smile on their face. "And doesn't it look fun?"</p>
