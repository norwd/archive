	<!--<p>"The first of SIGBOVIK's three traditional deadlines is on <strong>March 3rd</strong>. The program chair has yet to decide the extension dates, but…" Q glances around conspicuously before leaning in. "I hear she's thinking about March 9th and March 15th."</p>-->

	<!--<p>"The brand new extended deadline is on <strong>March 9th</strong>. There should be one final extension that will push the deadline to March 15th. But you didn't hear that from me."</p>-->

	<!--<p>"The deadline for submissions is on <strong>March 15th</strong>. There will be no more extensions after this, so don't be late!"</p>-->

	<p>"O-oh, unfortunately the deadline for this year has passed. See? It's a negative number of days to the submission deadline."</p>

	<p>Q gestures at the sidebar, which indeed displays a number less than zero. Major bummer.</p>
