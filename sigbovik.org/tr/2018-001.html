<h2>Substitute Teacher Networks: Learning with Almost No Supervision</h2>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Learning through experience is time-consuming, inefficient
and often bad for your cortisol levels. To address this problem, a number of
recently proposed teacher-student methods have demonstrated the benefits of
private tuition, in which a single model learns from an ensemble of more
experienced tutors. Unfortunately, the cost of such supervision restricts good
representations to a privileged minority.  Unsupervised learning can be used to
lower tuition fees, but runs the risk of producing networks that require
extracurriculum learning to strengthen their CVs and create their own LinkedIn
profiles. Inspired by the logo on a promotional stress ball at a local
recruitment fair, we make the following three contributions.  First, we propose
a novel almost no supervision training algorithm that is effective, yet highly
scalable in the number of student networks being supervised, ensuring that
education remains affordable. Second, we demonstrate our approach on a typical
use case: learning to bake, developing a method that tastily surpasses the
current state of the art. Finally, we provide a rigorous quantitive analysis of
our method, proving that we have access to a calculator. Our work calls into
question the long-held dogma that life is the best teacher.</p>
