<h2> Links </h2>

<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Plains/3081/">The Online
Antique Sewing Machine Resource Page</a> - despite the fact that it's a
geocities.com site (I despise their advertising practices), this is a
very good site, including information on how to thread a shuttle bobbin,
pictures of many different machines, etc.  It's the best one I've found
so far.

<a href="http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring=collectsew;list">A
list of sites on the Sewing Machine Collectors WebRing</a> - a good
general link for sewing machine information.
