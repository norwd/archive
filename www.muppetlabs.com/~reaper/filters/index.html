<h2> Text Filters </h2>

</center>

<p> Somewhere along the way, I started collecting lex text filters.
These are commandline filters you can use in Unix, which will take
incoming text, and spit out.. "modified" text.  They might work in DOS
as well, but I'm not sure how you'd do it.

<p> <b>NOTE</b>: if you are offended by non-PC attitudes and
assumptions, do not read on!  These filters can be offensive by today's
standards.  While it's not my intention to shock or dismay anyone, I'm
also not going to prettify reality.  And the reality is that someone
wrote each one of these filters, most likely because they thought it was
funny.  I think they're funny too.

<p> For the purposes of the table below, I'll modify the following text
with each of the filters:

<i>
<p> Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. 

<p> Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can
long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We
have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final
resting place for those who here gave their lives that that
nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we
should do this.

<td> B1ff was a sort of amalgam character, who embodied all the worst
characteristics of newbie (your choice of) Usenet users, BBS users, etc.
He used too many exclamation points, couldn't figure out how to
capitalize things, etc.  See <a href =
"http://www.elsewhere.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG103">his entry in the
Jargon File</a>.</td>

<td> <a href="source/censortron.l">Censortron</a> </td>

<td> This filter is one that I created in a fit of anti-political
fervor.  It is intended to find offensive words and replace them with
the text "[CENSORED]" -- this isn't a very good demonstrative text for
this filter. </td>

<td> <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and

<td> <a href="source/chef.l">Chef</a> </td>

<td> Also known as the Swedish Chef filter, this does about what you'd
expect -- turns the incoming text into a very good approximation of what
the Swedish Chef from The Muppet Show sounds like.  If you've never seen
the Muppet Show, this will either be boring or slightly offensive. </td>

<td> <a href="source/clockwork.l">Clockwork</a> </td>

<td> This filter is supposed to change text into something that might
have come from the move "A Clockwork Orange," I believe.  I haven't seen
this movie, so I cannot comment too closely on it. </td>

<td> <p>Four score and seven years ago our fatthe devochkas brought
forth on this continent, a what's all this about a new way nation,
conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal.

<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whetthe devochka that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We
are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come and get one
in the  yarbles to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting
place for those who the devochkae gave their lives that that nation might
live. It is altogetthe devochka fitting and proper that we should do
this. </td>

<tr>
<td> <a href="source/feminazi.l">Feminazi</a> </td>

<td> I think that this filter is meant to mock the overly-aggressive
femininsts who've made their various presences known through books,
magazines, and other media (probably the Internet also of late, although
I haven't looked). </td>

<td> <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a postmodern nation, conceived  in the penetrated space of
liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that deconstructed all men
are created equal.

<p>Now the dysfunctional group are engaged  in the penetrated space
of a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so
conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
battlefield of that deconstructed war. We have come to dedicate a portion
of that deconstructed field, as a final resting place for reevalution
of Manichaeanism and those who here gave their lives that deconstructed
that nation might live. It is semiotically altogether fitting and proper
that deconstructed we should do this. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> <a href="source/jive.l">Jive</a> </td>

<td> This filter mimics the speech of 70's era black culture.  If you
like this, the "blacksploitation" films of that decade may appeal to
you ("Shaft" and "Blackula" being the two examples I can think of right
now). </td>

<td> <p>Four sco'e and seven years ago our faders brought fo'd on dis
continent, some new nashun, conceived in liberty, and dedicated t'de
proposishun dat all dudes are created equal.

<p>Now we are engaged in some great civil war, testin' wheda' dat nashun,
o' any nashun so's conceived and so's dedicated, kin long endure.
What it is, Mama! We are met on some great battlefield uh dat war.
Ah be baaad... We gots' mosey on down to dedicate some po'shun uh dat
field, as some final restin' place fo' dose who here gave deir lives
dat dat nashun might live.  What it is, Mama! It be altogeda' fittin'
and propuh' dat we should do dis. </td>

<tr>
<td> <a href="source/kraut.l">Kraut</a> </td>

<td> I think this filter is just a general mockery of the way a native
German speaker speaks English -- a long-time favorite of cartoon
villians and movie badguys.  I disagree with at least one aspect of this
filter: native German speakers tend to say "zis" instead of "dis" when
pronouncing the word "this."  (At least, in Hamburg they did.) </td>

<td> <p>Four score undt sefen years ago our faders brought ford on
dis continent, a new nation, konceifed in liberty, and dedicated to ze
proposition dat all men are kreated equal.

<p>Now we are engaged in a great kifil var, testingkt vheder dat nation,

<tr>
<td> <a href="source/nakedlunch.l">Nakedlunch</a> </td>

<td> The Nakedlunch filter picks certain choice keywords and replaced
this with phrases from the book/movie of the same name.  This sample
doesn't seem to have hit any of those words, but look through the
source, and you'll get an idea. </td>

<td> <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. 

<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can
long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We

<tr>
<td> <a href="source/newspeak.l">Newspeak</a> </td>

<td> Newspeak is my absolute favorite filter of the bunch.  The others
are fun, but this is a work of genius, and it's nowhere near done.
Newspeak is the language that Orwell proposed the State would create and
push, in his book "1984".  Aside from being a wonderful work of fiction
and well worth a read, the language that Orwell proposes is very
interesting.  This filter tends to work best on political speeches and
announcements. </td>

<td> <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a new nation, conceived in crimethink, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. 

<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can
long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We
have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final
resting place for those who here gave their lives that that
nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we
should do this.

<tr>
<td> <a href="source/urantia.l">Urantia</a> </td>

<td> The Urantia filter frankly boggles me.  I have no idea what it's
referring to (although a quick search suggests it's probably a religion
of some kind).  I suggest you hit <a
href="http://www.urantia.org">Urantia.org</a> and see if they have
anything to say for themselves. </td>

<td> <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a agondonter nation, conceived enseraphimed for travel liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition Father-initiated divinity-tension all
Adamites are mindal created equal.

<p>Now we are mindal engaged enseraphimed for travel a great civil war in
heaven, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so
dedicated, can long endure. We are mindal met on a great battlefield
of Father-initiated divinity-tension war in heaven. We have indwell
to dedicate a portion of Father-initiated divinity-tension field, as a
final resting Satania planet for those who traversing the morontia phases
of ascension gave their lives Father-initiated divinity-tension that
nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper Father-initiated
divinity-tension we should do this. </td>

<tr>
<td> <a href="source/valspeak.l">Valspeak</a> </td>

<td> This is the infamous (and less funny now that everyone seems to
speak this way) ValSpeak filter.  Like, ohmigawd!  Yah.  I seem to
recall that I modified the source a little bit to be closer to true
ValSpeak and take out some strange Midwesternisms that were in there.

<td> <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this

and dedicated to th' proposition that all men are created equal.

<p>Now we are engaged in a awesum civil war, fer shure, testin' whether

<tr>
<td> <a href="source/warez.l">Warez</a> </td>

<td> This filter is entirely my own creation.  After reading
hacker-speak for years, and watching websites go down with hacker-ified
text put up in their places, I decided I should make it easier to type
like a true h4x0r.  It may take a second or two to get into the rhythm
of the text, but it's possible to read.  This filter needs some
improvement to deal with special cases which are usually spelled one way
("phreak", "war3z", "d00d", etc.). </td>
