<h2> RAM-mount GPS mount pictures </h2>

<p> Mar 1, 2001

<p> These are pictures of a <a
href="http://www.ram-mount.com/">RAM-mount</a> GPS mount, designed
specifically for the Garmin 12 series of GPS receiver.  I've had a 12XL
for a while, but hadn't found a really good use for it, until I stumbled
across this mount.  My devious little mind got going, and I ordered one
straight away (from <a
href="http://www.gps4fun.com">www.gps4fun.com</a>, where the prices are
cheap and they were really nice to deal with).  It's quite useful, and I
love having this navigational tool onboard.

<p> The power cable is a standard Garmin power-only cable, which I've
modified with a quick-disconnect plug, so that I can switch between the
BMW power plug and the regular cigarette lighter plug -- not necessarily
a modification for the faint of heart, but also not very hard (just make
sure your quick disconnect is keyed so you can't connect it
backwards, and check twice for polarity before plugging anything in).

<p> The mount itself is surprisingly sturdy, and does its job very well.
It can be set in any number of positions, and when you set it in a
position, it stays there.  The way things are set up in these pictures,
I can push hard on the GPS buttons without anything flexing, much less
slipping.  Not bad for $31 plus shipping!

<p> I admit, it's geeky, but if you're looking at this site, chances are
you're at least part geek yourself, and admit it, this is cool.
