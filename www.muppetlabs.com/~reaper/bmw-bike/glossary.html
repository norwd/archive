<h2> Motorcycle (mostly BMW-centric) glossary </h2>

<p> I only just started in this whole motorcycle thing in summer of 1999.
When I started out, I kept seeing these terms used by the motorcycle
press, which everyone was supposed to understand.  Naturally, it took me
months of further reading before I figured out what was going on, and in
some cases, I didn't understand until I actually owned and rode a bike
for the first time, in November of '99.

<p> I figured, if I had those problems, other people probably do as
well, and I might as well help them out if I can.  So I wrote up this
glossary of motorcycle jargon for your enjoyment.  I'm positive that I'm
missing about 90% of the terms that confuse newcomers to the motorcycle
world, so I'd love to hear your suggestions: send me <a
href="mailto:reaper@speakeasy.org">email</a>.

<p> Since most of my motorcycle experience to this point is centered
around BMW's, that will be a bias in this glossary.  I'm not trying to
exclude other brands, but there may be terms that don't often get
applied to BMW's but are common in other circles.  I'm also making the
assumption that you, the reader, have experience with other vehicles
(such as cars) and know most terms from that area.  If you don't there
are plenty of good car glossaries which can help you out.

<h3> The Glossary </h3>

<a name="boxer"></a>
<h4> Boxer </h4>

<p> The term "Boxer" refers to an engine style where a pair of cylinders
are horizontally opposed to each other -- if you look at the two
cylinders from the top, they're almost on the same line, on either side
of the engine.  When they fire, they do so on opposite strokes, but both
cylinders move in towards the crankshaft and out away from the
crankshaft at the same time.  The result, at least in theory, is a
vibrationless engine.

<a name="notchy"></a>
<h4> Notchy shifting </h4>

<p> When someone says a shifter feels notchy, they mean that there's not
a silky smooth feeling when moving the shift lever from one gear to
another.  It feels almost like there are "notches" you have to move the
lever past in order to make a complete transition from one gear to
another.  Usually, if you stop when you hit one of those notches, you'll
find a <a href="glossary.html#false_neutral">false neutral</a>.

<a name="false_neutral"></a>
<h4> False neutral </h4>

<p> A motorcycle transmission usually has 4 or five gears, plus a
designated "neutral" -- a position in which the transmission doesn't
power the rear wheel.  This neutral is usually found between first and
second gear.  When you find a <i>false</i> neutral, you've shifted the
transmission so that the gears aren't properly engaged, and it feels
like you're in neutral again: the wheel's not receiving any power from
the engine.  However, this happens between gears other than first and
second, which is bad.  It usually means that gears and engaging levers
are spinning with sub-millimeter clearance between them, probably doing
Bad Things to the transmission.  This is usually the result of hitting a
particularly <a href="glossary.html#notchy">notchy</a> transition between gears.

<a name="bar-end"></a>
<h4> Bar-end mirrors </h4>

<p> Bar-end mirrors are a style of mirror (arguably the most famous is
the Napoleon brand) which attaches to the end of a bike's handlebars,
just like the name suggests.  The mirror is thus placed further out
board than anything else on the bike (unless you've got huge saddlebags
attached), and usually means you can see what's actually behind you,
like with a car's mirrors.

<a name="k-bike"></a>
<h4> BMW K-bike </h4>

<p> In the early '80's, BMW decided to revitalize their motorcycle line
up by replacing all the old <a href="glossary.html#airhead">Airhead R-bikes</a> with
a new style of bike that had an inline-3 and inline-4 engine, and many
advanced features.  The result was the K series of bikes (the K100, K75,
etc.)  These motorcycles have inline engines (the cylinders are lined up
in a row, like many automobile engines), fuel injection, advanced
suspension design, etc.  All the latest greatest technology.  The K-bike
line was the first in the world to incorporate Anti-lock Brakes, in the
eighties.

<p> K-bikes are sometimes called "flying bricks" or "whining bricks" due
to their brick-shaped engine, and the Jetson's-hovercar whining sound
they make.  The engines, while very advanced, powerful, and fuel efficient,
are nearly impossible for an amateur mechanic to do much with.  They are
therefore a trade-off for those of us with a more limited budget.

<a name="r-bike"></a>
<h4> R-bikes </h4>

<p> R-bikes come in two flavors: <a href="glossary.html#airhead">Airheads</a> and <a
href="glossary.html#oilhead">Oilheads</a>.  These two flavors share a basic engine
layout in common, the <a href="glossary.html#boxer">Boxer</a>, and not a whole lot
else.  They both look like motorcycles, and aside from basic things like
wheels and handlebars, aren't too much alike.  The Oilheads are clearly
descended from the Airheads, but in the same way that a housecat is
clearly descended from a tiger.  (I won't hazard a guess which way
'round that goes.)

<p> The term "R-bike" comes from the fact that motorcycles of this type
are all named as R and then a number, like R65, R100 or R1200.  Most of
the motorcycles have a suffix, like LS, GS, R, RT, RS, etc.  Each of
these suffixes has a meaning, usually indicating a "body type" or "trim
type" based on the same model.  For example, an R100 RT is an R100
motorcycle with touring trim on it (big fairing, hard bags, etc.).  An
R80 GS is an R80 with modifications to make it more offroad worthy (GS
stands for "Gelände/Strasse", which means "Field/Street" or
"Country/Street").

<a name="airhead"></a>
<h4> Airhead R-bikes </h4>

<p> Way back after World War I, BMW was prohibited from making any
"machines of war," which primarily included airplanes.  The brass at BMW
decided that they'd like to stay in business, so they borrowed an engine
design that reminded them of an airplane engine -- the <a
href="glossary.html#boxer">Boxer</a> -- to put into a motorcycle.  That engine design
stayed with them for a long, long time, and its penultimate (so far)
form was the Airhead.

<p> This is an engine that has two cylinders in the Boxer layout, and is
air cooled.  I won't even attempt to divine at what point in history BMW
started producing Airheads, as opposed to whatever came before them.
The engine is also normally aspirated, via a carbeuretor on each side.

<p> The term Airhead can actually refer to either the engine, or the
bike wrapped around the engine.  Basically, Airheads were produced up
until 1995 (I think) in the US, with the R100 Mystic.

<a name="oilhead"></a>
<h4> Oilhead R-bikes </h4>

<p> Oilheads are BMW's answer to consumer complains when they announced
they'd be killing off the R-bike line in the late eighties or early
nineties.  They realized they'd alienate a big chunk of their customers,
but they didn't want to keep flogging the poor Airheads, which were no
longer even vaguely modern bikes.  The result was the Oilhead, which is
an Airhead engine warped 20 years into the future.

<p> The term Oilhead comes from the fact that this engine type is oil
cooled, and has oil flowing up into the heads.  These engines really are
drastically redesigned Airheads, with the basic layout being the real
resemblance to the Airhead.  Fuel injection is used instead of
carbeuration.  Engine control computers are normal on these bikes.  New
materials were used in the construction of the engine.  The bike which
goes around the engine is also different, with a greatly upgraded
suspension, gearbox, clutch, appearance, etc.  (Well, I say upgraded
appearance, what I really mean is "different" appearance -- I don't like
the new looks much.)

<p> I think Oilheads first appeared in the early nineties, '92 or so.  I
may be wrong about that, though.  Consult the BMW timeline, listed on my
<a href="index.html">main page</a> for a precise account.
