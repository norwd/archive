<p> Having turned in my R65 for a clutch replacement, I was given the
K75s <a href="../galleries/k75s/index.html">pictured here</a> as a loaner.  I figured I
might as well continue on my grand tradition(?) and review this bike
(with an eye towards comparisons to my R65, naturally) as well.

<h3> Overview </h3>

<p> The K75s, as far as I can tell, was made with almost the same intent
as the R65 LS.  It's a small bike using the contemporary engine
technology, aimed at sportier riders, and not caring much about full-on
touring.  It has a number of sportier features than other bikes in the
line, without giving up the basic refinement and style of those bikes.

<p> Since the K-bike line was intended to replace the <a
href="k75s.html#boxer">Boxers</a> entirely at
the time this motorcycle was being designed, this makes sense as an R65
LS replacement.

<p> The engine is a three-cylinder inline engine, much like a
shrunk-down car engine.  It uses fuel injection instead of carburation.
From the clutch to the drive shaft is basically unchanged -- still a
single plate clutch and nearly the same clunky gearbox.  The brakes in
front are remarkably similar to the R65 LS's, but the back is a
<i>much</i> better disc brake.  The frame is significantly different
from the R65, with the engine forming a member of the frame, rather than
resting inside it.

<h3> The Engine </h3>

<a href="../galleries/k75s/images/DCP00498.JPG"><img src=
"../galleries/k75s/images/DCP00498-sm.JPG" align="left"></a>

<p> This engine is <i>so very</i> different from the engine on the R65.
Instead of being a low-end-torque machine with a big flywheel, the K75
feels like it has no flywheel at all.  When you twitch the throttle,
the familiar sensation of torque pulling the bike to the right is
absent.

<p> When I first started the engine, I thought something might be wrong
-- there was a high-pitched whine accompanying the "normal" engine
noises that was very strange sounding.  I knew beforehand that K-bikes
whined, I just didn't think it was quite so prominent.  The engine sound
actually reminds me very distinctly of the Jetson's hovercars -- that
high-pitched whining putt-putt is almost exactly the sound of this
motorcycle accelerating slowly away in first gear.

<p> Something about fuel-injected engines has always made me feel
disconnected from how it all works.  This remains true on the K75.
Although it certainly does accelerate well.  I think this engine has
less low-end-torque than the R65 though, since I've killed it once when
the R bike wouldn't have died, pulling into traffic (bad time to kill an
engine, by the way).

<p> Starting this engine is also much easier than on the R65, although I
think that is to be expected.  The "choke" lever isn't actually
operating a choke so much as a fast-idle cam on the injector controller.
Once it's started, the engine idles smoothly.

<h3> The Driveline </h3>

<a href="../galleries/k75s/images/DCP00502.JPG"><img src=
"../galleries/k75s/images/DCP00502-sm.JPG" align="right"></a>

<p> The path taken by the engine power, getting from the engine to the
wheel, is essentially the same as on my R65.  The clutch on this bike
feels much crisper (although perhaps my clutch will feel the same way
after its replacement) than the R65, and the gearbox feels slightly
improved.  The one "major" change that I've noticed is that the shift
lever now stops in the middle position after you've hit first gear (you
can't press it down any more).  This makes it a bit more obvious when
you've gone all the way down.

<p> The gearbox is still fairly <a href="k75s.html#notchy">notchy</a>, with plenty
of opportunities (or so it seems) to find <a href="k75s.html#false_neutral">false
neutrals</a>.  I haven't
actually found any yet, so I may be misinterpreting the catch I feel
halfway through the throw.  Downshifting feels a bit more positive though.

<h3> The Brakes </h3>

<p> The first thing I noticed about the brakes on this bike was the fact
that the rear brake actually does something.  Unlike on the R65, I can
actually slow down the entire machine with the rear brake on the K75.
The front brakes feel sort of weak by comparison, but I can't tell if
that's due to the rear brake being so powerful, or if it's that they're
actually weaker than I'm used to.  Perhaps "less bite" might better
describe the front brakes -- I know they'll stop the bike quite well,
you just have to be more aggressive to do it.

<h3> The Suspension </h3>

<p> The K75s uses the Monolever rear suspension, which basically means
you get one swingarm going back instead of two.  It also means that you
have one shock and one spring in the rear -- on the particular bike I'm
borrowing, the stock shock has been replaced with an Ohlins shock with a
remote reservoir.  I can't really comment on the Ohlins shock, as I
won't have time to adjust it properly.

<p> The front suspension is almost exactly the same as on the R65 -- a
hydraulic fork with a spring in each leg.  The springs on this
motorcycle are stiffer than the R65, which is pretty nice for regular
riding, but could be improved for going over big bumps.

<h3> The Dashboard and Fairing </h3>

<a href="../galleries/k75s/images/DCP00507.JPG"><img src=
"../galleries/k75s/images/DCP00507-sm.JPG" align="left"></a>

<p> The dashboard on this bike is one of the areas of greatest
improvement, to me.  (Well, ok, the engine is pretty significant, but
I'm more thinking of things that are comparable between the two bikes.)
It has the speedometer and tachometer as you'd expect, but it has two
additions that I <i>really</i> like: a clock, and an indicator that
shows which gear you're in.  The clock is pretty much standard issue, as
far as I can tell, but it's a very welcome change from the R65's dash.
The gear indicator is a little single-digit LCD display in the lower
right corner of the tachometer -- but what a nice thing!  Perhaps I'm
just showing my neophyte preferences, but I really like having an
indication of what gear I'm in, rather than having to calculate RPM vs.
speed, or keep the current gear in mind for a whole trip.  Especially
with the quieter engine, it's very nice to have.

<p> The downside of the dashboard is that (at least on the example I
have) it's not attached very well.  Going over bumps would be humorous,
except that I'm worried the instrument cluster is going to fall off.  It
wobbles back and forth and makes disconcerting noises.  This hasn't
apparently had a negative effect on the function of the instruments, but
that can't go on forever.

<h3> Riding Impressions </h3>

<p> The K75s I rode was a pretty nice bike.  It clearly had felt its
38,000 miles, but it wasn't especially worn out.  It wasn't as quick to
steer as the R65, and was a little bit top heavy, comparatively.  Its
engine is clearly superior from a riding standpoint.  From a service
standpoint, I'll stick with the old <a href="k75s.html#boxer">Boxer</a>.

<p> Although I know this is a personal thing, I found the fixed fairing
and instruments were quite disconcerting -- it felt as though the wheel
wasn't moving, and starting into a turn (turning from a driveway onto a
street for instance) was difficult.  With the fairing and such all
pointed straight ahead, I was unable to overcome the fear that the wheel
was pointed straight ahead as well.

<p> This bike also reaffirmed by dislike for regular mirrors -- bar-end
mirrors are far superior for me.  Perhaps I'm too wide or something, but
regular mirrors either show me what's 45 degrees behind me, or my arms.
Neither is particularly useful when trying to determine if there's a
truck with no brakes screaming towards me at a stop sign.  Bar-end
mirrors, on the other hand, are wide enough to show what's actually
behind me.  I'm sure this is a matter of personal taste, though.

<p> The seating position on the K75s surprised me.  I had thought I was
stretched forward on the R65 LS; boy was I wrong!  The K75 had the
handlebars placed at least an inch forward, perhaps more, so that I was
approaching the sport-bike tuck.  Getting on the R65 afterwards, I
realized that the K75 felt about a foot longer in front, mostly due to
the longer reach to the bars, and the fairing, which thrusts forward
from the bars.

<h3> Glossary (Stuff I wish people had told me when I was starting) </h3>

<a name="boxer"></a>
<h4> Boxer </h4>

<p> The term "Boxer" refers to an engine style where a pair of cylinders
are horizontally opposed to each other -- if you look at the two
cylinders from the top, they're almost on the same line, on either side
of the engine.  When they fire, they do so on opposite strokes, but both
cylinders move in towards the crankshaft and out away from the
crankshaft at the same time.  The result, at least in theory, is a
vibrationless engine.

<a name="notchy"></a>
<h4> Notchy shifting </h4>

<p> When someone says a shifter feels notchy, they mean that there's not
a silky smooth feeling when moving the shift lever from one gear to
another.  It feels almost like there are "notches" you have to move the
lever past in order to make a complete transition from one gear to
another.  Usually, if you stop when you hit one of those notches, you'll
find a <a href="k75s.html#false_neutral">false neutral</a>.

<a name="false_neutral"></a>
<h4> False neutral </h4>

<p> A motorcycle transmission usually has 4 or five gears, plus a
designated "neutral" -- a position in which the transmission doesn't
power the rear wheel.  This neutral is usually found between first and
second gear.  When you find a <i>false</i> neutral, you've shifted the
transmission so that the gears aren't properly engaged, and it feels
like you're in neutral again: the wheel's not receiving any power from
the engine.  However, this happens between gears other than first and
second, which is bad.  It usually means that gears and engaging levers
are spinning with sub-millimeter clearance between them, probably doing
Bad Things to the transmission.  This is usually the result of hitting a
particularly <a href="k75s.html#notchy">notchy</a> transition between gears.

<a name="bar-end"></a>
<h4> Bar-end mirrors </h4>

<p> Bar-end mirrors are a style of mirror (arguably the most famous is
the Napoleon brand) which attaches to the end of a bike's handlebars,
just like the name suggests.  The mirror is thus placed further out
board than anything else on the bike (unless you've got huge saddlebags
attached), and usually means you can see what's actually behind you,
like with a car's mirrors.
