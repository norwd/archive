<p> Feb 23, 2001

<p> In June 2000, I bought a 1995 K75/3A, and a review has been a long
time coming.  So, here it is.

<h3> Overview </h3>

<p> <a href= "../galleries/95-k75/images/DCP00536.JPG"><img align="right"

<p> The K75 was the smallest of BMW's new K series of motorcycles, at
about 740 cc.  It also, coincidentally, produces 75 PS (one PS is equal
to 0.9863201 horsepower, so 75 PS is about 74 horsepower in US units).
In any case, it was the smallest in the line, and was correspondingly
the least expensive.  There were several variants, including the K75C,
the K75S and the K75RT.  The variations basically consisted of different
fairings and handlebar setups.

<p> The K75 was last imported to the US in 1995, and was last
produced in Germany in 1996 according to various sources.
It had various options available, such as ABS, hard bags,
etc.  The particular bike I have was ordered with ABS, and
hard bags were installed after delivery, along with a <a href=

Sport</a> fairing.

<h3> The Engine </h3>

<p> As I reported in my <a href="k75s.html">K75S review</a>, the K
series engine is significantly different from the R series, or boxer,
engine.  I will expand on that assessment in this review.

<p> Having ridden this bike for 8 months now, I have a fairly concise
opinion of the engine.  I think it's a wonderful engine, with a few
flaws:

<p><ul>
<li> Too precise feeling
<li> Lacking low-end horsepower
<li> Very little else
</ul>

<p> That's a pretty short list.  Let me explain what I mean.

<p> <b>Too precise feeling</b>: The engine is so well balanced and so
smooth that it's kind of boring.  There is certainly some vibration if
you press your heels against the frame rather than letting the peg
rubber take it up.  It certainly has its own personality.  But it's sort
of a "sewing machine" personality -- it just goes and does it well.
There's no interesting vibration, no real feel to it.  And, I was rather
surprised recently when I heard a bike start and said to myself, "that
sounds like a K bike!"  I turned around, and there stood a random
Kawasaki (I say "random" because I can't idenfity Kawasaki's, not to
slight the brand).  In other words, it sounds like a lot of other
motorcycles that are out there.

<p> <b>Lacking low-end horsepower</b>: This is actually pretty obvious.
It's just kind of weak coming off the line -- but watch out when it goes
over about 3-4000 RPM.  Sure, most engines develop more power at higher
revs, but this bike comes out of nowhere and tries to throw you off the
saddle.  The practical upshot of this is that you need to either keep
the tachometer above the 10 o'clock line, or be prepared for performance
like your Honda Civic.

<p> My particular bike seems to be emitting a goodly deal of unburnt
gasoline in its exhaust, and I need to take it in to have that
addressed.  It mostly happens in the mornings, and when the bike's cold
(a failing temperature sensor might be causing it).

<h3> The Driveline </h3>

<p> My <a href="k75s.html">previous opinion</a> about the K75 driveline
remains fairly accurate.  The transmission is fairly accurate, albeit a
bit notchy and klunky.  The smooth, quiet shifts are the exception, not
the rule, but I rarely find a false neutral any more.

<p> This is due in part to a technique taught to me by someone on the
<a href = "http://www.airheads.org/">Airheads mailing list</a> (a list
dedicated to older-style Boxer-powered BMWs) -- namely, when upshifting,
just hold the shift lever up until the clutch is out rather than bumping
it up and letting go.  This ensures that even if you don't get the next
gear to engage, when you start letting out the clutch, it will engage at
that time.

<h3> The Brakes </h3>

<a href="../galleries/95-k75/images/DCP00538.JPG"><img align="left" src=
"../galleries/95-k75/images/DCP00538-sm.JPG"></a>

<p> The brakes on this bike are wonderful.  This particular bike has
dual disks in front, and a single, undrilled disk in back.  The rear
brake is deceptively strong (deceptive because it feels better to use
the rear brake, but that's a <b>bad bad idea</b> in the real world), and
the front brakes are fine, but lack bite.  The front brakes are actually
plenty powerful, but you do have to give them a good squeeze -- this
isn't a real stoppie-worthy bike.  I suspect that replacing the front
pads with something more aggressive would fix this, but it's not a big
enough problem that I'm going to worry about it.

<p> The thing that looks like a gear ring in this picture is the ABS
sensor wheel.  It counts pulses off that ring, and compares the pulses
between front and rear wheels -- when they get out of sync, the slower
one is getting close to sliding, and the computer kicks in the
modulator.

<p> The ABS system is actually quite useful.  It's rare that I
accidentally engage it (although a combination of overzealous rear brake
application and wet pavement brings it in occasionally), but it's very
nice to have.  On the occasions that I have used it, I've been
<i>very</i> glad to have the system working for me.  It makes kind of a
frightening "chunk! chunk!" noise when it kicks in, but it doesn't push
back on the brake control, unlike some cars I've driven.  It can be
disabled by pressing the ABS switch on the dashboard before driving off.

<p> ABS is one of those features that should be available for every
motorcycle.  I've heard related <a href=
"http://www.ibmwr.org/prodreview/abstests.html">a tale of one rider
(search for "other hazards")</a>
who accidentally got onto a wet lawn, and was able to bring his bike to
a safe stop (although with a very long stopping distance) with the aid
of the ABS system.

<h3> The Suspension </h3>

<p> In this day and age, the K75's suspension is nothing special.  BMW
has already trumped both front and rear with their current production
motorcycles, and most modern bikes handle better and with more precision
than this bike.

<p> When you take into account that the frame and suspension were
designed in the early 80's, though, it's a fine setup (and certainly
feels more secure than my old R65 LS).

<h3> The Dashboard </h3>

<p> The dashboard on this bike is great.  The normal tach and
speedometer are there, along with indicator lights for both turn
signals, high beam, neutral, brake light failure, oil, battery and
overtemp idiot lights, and a gas light which comes on too early.  What's
cool (I thought so when I first rode a K bike, and I still think so
today) is the fact of a clock and gear indicator.  I know neither are
new or radical ideas, but they're things that should exist on all
motorcycles.

<p> In some recent testing with a GPS receiver, I've discovered that my
speedometer is indeed a bit optimistic, but not too much, showing a
maximum discrepancy of about 7 MPH at an indicated 90 MPH.  It's a bit
hard to tell with any accuracy though, since for some asinine reason,
this speedometer goes up to 160 MPH.  I don't know the last time you
rode 160 (which is a good 40 MPH over the rated top speed in any case),
but I'd much rather my speedo went to 85 or 100 and had a better
resolution at lower speeds.  If I ever get above 85 or so, I'm going to
care much more about the road than seeing how fast I'm going.

<h3> Riding Impressions </h3>

<p> Overall, this is an easy bike to ride.  The engine can be a bit
tricky, especially when cold (remember, no torque), and it's still not a
precise cornering machine, but beyond that it's great.

<p> When the engine has just started, you have to remember to rev it up
well before moving, or you will stop abruptly.  It's much better when
it's warm, but this is still no torque machine.  No taking off in idle
for this monster (on some of the older airheads, with their low-end
torque and huge flywheels, you could, with care, start moving without
touching the throttle).

<p> This is also not a V-twin cruiser, and if you want to have any
power, you need to rev the engine.  However, having done that, you'll be
flying with the best of them -- I accidentally lift the wheel off the
ground in second gear under good acceleration.  Certainly that's nothing
compared to a modern pocket rocket, but for a 5 year old Bavarian
standard it's nothing to sneeze at.

<p> The handling of the bike is fine for most tasks, but it still feels
a bit wobbly going around corners.  Maybe it's my tires, maybe I need a
new rear shock, I'm not sure.  It's the feeling that all's well,
but don't push too hard.  For almost all my riding, that's just fine.
It comports itself well over bumps, and doesn't do anything unexpected.
