<h2> 1984 Honda Sabre V65 </h2>
</center>

<p> Mar 11, 2001

<p> Service time again.  The K75 went in to Cascade BMW for a service
smorgasbord, and I borrowed a Honda Sabre V65 for the duration.  I
thought to myself, "Oh, a V65, must be a 650.  Sounds like fun."  I was,
to put it mildly, dead wrong.

<p> It turned out, upon questioning, that this was in fact an 1100 cc
four cylinder fire breather.  The salesman who was loaning it to me
said, "you can borrow this, as long as you promise not to kill
yourself on it."  He was smiling as he said that, but I realize now
what exactly he was talking about.  This is the bike that the bully,
who sat sullenly in the back of class, would ride.  This bike is designed
for people who have every need to go as fast as possible, regardless of
what's happening around them.

<h3> Riding Impressions </h3>

<p> First things first.  I got the bike started with no fuss (full choke
for a few seconds, then half choke for perhaps 20 seconds, then she's
good to go).  I noticed it had a fairly satisfying deep bass note to the
exhaust.  I clambered aboard, twitched the throttle a few times, and
headed off.  The first thing I noticed: this bike does <i>not</i> want
to go slowly.  That may have you grinning like a babboon, but this was
rush hour, and 20 MPH or slower is the order of the day.  Having the
bike champing at the bit to go 90+ MPH was a real pain in the ass.  I
spent a lot of time rocking back and forth over the
"accelerate/decelerate" line, which this bike doesn't really do
gracefully.

<p> Motor aside, the bike was fairly mundane.  The suspension wasn't
bad, but wasn't good either.  The steering was pretty heavy.  Slow-speed
maneuvering was kind of difficult, although the balance was better than
on the top-heavy K75. It had a disturbing habit of falling into turns
once past a certain lean angle, which may be attributable to the tires,
but was disconcerting nonetheless.  The brakes were nice and strong, but
I wouldn't expect any less from a bike with this size motor.  They didn't
have a particularly good feel, and you had to grab a fair handful before
really slowing down.

<p> So, for all that griping, when there was a clear lane ahead of me,
this bike was <i>fun</i>.  Roll on any amount of throttle, from any RPM
above 2k, and the bike leapt forward like a mule had kicked it.  At one
point while trying this out, I noticed as I shifted from 2nd to 3rd that
the speedo was wavering around 60 MPH, and the engine was still
accelerating hard.  I had to lean way forward to keep the front wheel on
the ground when really accelerating, in any gear.  It was exceedingly
satisfying to barely move the throttle and jump 20 MPH faster without
knowing quite what happened.

<p> This bike, with 101 HP and a Godzilla-sized punch, still falls short
of modern sportbikes.  A new Honda 650 would probably be comparable to
this bike, performance-wise, and a 750 or 1000 cc bike would almost
certainly beat it.  They also weigh a lot less, some as much as 200
pounds less.

<h3> The "ergos" </h3>

<p> The ergonomics of this motorcycle are pretty basic.  You sit almost
straight upright (I found myself leaning forward just a tiny bit), but
the bike is wide.  The handlebars are wide (probably to help combat that
heavy steering), the pegs are wide and high (to keep them from dragging
around corners, I'm sure), and the gastank is fairly wide.  Once I got
used to them, the pegs were fine, but the first few times taking off, I
just jabbed my ankles with them.

<p> For how long I had the bike, I really should have re-adjusted the
rear brake.  The pedal was way too high for me, suggesting that the
previous owner either didn't know any better, or was about 5' tall.  It
would have been a simple matter of undoing a hex head bolt and moving
the lever on the splined shaft, but I never got to it.
<p> The instrument panel was alright, although I would have preferred
bigger gauges, and a smaller LCD section.  The speedo went to 160, which
isn't actually a farfetched number for this bike.  It seems unlikely
that most riders would take it much past 90 or 100, but I guess I can
almost understand the reasoning here.  The tach, as you can see,
redlines at 10,000 RPM (which I never got near).  The LCD section had
gauges for gear position (with 6th gear represented as "OD"), fuel
level, water temperature, and clock.  On this particular bike, the clock
and fuel level gauge were broken, but the water temp. and gear position
were clear and easy to read.  Again due to the used nature of this
motorcycle, the plastic lenses on the instruments were cloudy and hard
to see through.

<p> The seat was unremarkable, although my tailbone did start aching
after only 20 minutes on the bike.  That's the kind of thing that will
differ from person to person, though.

<h3> The engine and transmission </h3>

<p> The engine has largely already been described.  It's big and
powerful, and don't you dare get in its way.  It makes a good noise when
it's idling, and a powerful-sounding blatt, reminiscent of an airplane
taking off, when it's accelerating.  I understand from some <a href =
"http://neko.mi.org/~tawollen/pictures/motorcycles/specs-sabre.jpg">specs I
found on the web</a>, that this bike gets about 37 MPG, which is really
depressing, since my K75 only get 37 if I've been riding gently, or on
the freeway a lot.

<p> The transmission was nicely done, with good gear spacing, and easy
shifting action.  Gears shifted with a little click, although the action
was heavy.  None of the BMW thunking and sticking that I'm used to.  I
didn't have any hints of false neutrals.

<p> This bike has a shaft final drive, rather than the more traditional
chain.  It was clear from this bike (keep in mind, it's a 1984 model,
which is only a year or so into Honda's foray into shaft drive) that
Honda didn't quite know what they were doing.  The shaft made some
pretty interesting gear-lash noises.  Nothing untoward happened, but
anytime I transitioned from decelerating to accelerating it made a
distinct "click-clk" noise.

<h3> Suspension and brakes </h3>

<p> The suspension on this bike is fairly basic.  Sprung fork legs in
front, and double trailing arms in back.  I never actually saw the shock
in back, and I assume it or they were hiding behind some of the plastic
paneling forward of the rear wheel.

<p> The suspension is not entirely without noteworthy features, though.
I noticed that the front end didn't seem to dive as much when braking,
and sure enough, on closer inspection, there is some clever system
intended to reduce it.  It seemed to work, although there was definitely
still some brake dive.

<p> The actual ride was, well, "normal."  It didn't seem to handle big
bumps very well, and was only mediocre over small stuff.  The frame was
nice and stiff, so it felt steady going around corners.  The suspension
on this bike is the number one reason I'd call it a "go straight and
fast" bike rather than a twisties bike or a commuter.  (Sort of like a
jacked up Nova is a go straight and fast car.)

<p> The brakes were fairly nice.  Powerful when you squeeze hard, with
no signs of fading (although I didn't ever encounter a situation where
brakes would have started fading), but a little bit slow to grab.  Until
I had occasion to stop quickly, I feared the brakes might be a bit
weak.  Not a problem.
