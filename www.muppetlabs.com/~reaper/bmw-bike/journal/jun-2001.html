<td> I pulled apart the speedometer on my R100 over the weekend, with an
eye towards replacing some or all of the light bulbs with LEDs, and also
to repaint the labels under the warning lights.  If you look at <a
href="../galleries/r100s/images/r100s-005.jpg">this picture</a>, you can
see the "before" image, and if you look <a
href="images/r100-speedo.jpg">here</a> you can see the "after" shot.
The lettering isn't as nice as having a machine press the ink into the
plastic of the face, but the $3.50 #0000 brush was sure a lot cheaper
than buying a new instrument pod.

<p> I used Testors Enamel, purchased at Fred Meyer (a regional
we-sell-most-everything store) for $1.09 to paint, as carefully as
possible, the lettering back into the grooves left by the original
letters.  I can't say I did a wonderful job, but it's not going to be a
problem to determine which light is on anymore.  The next owner might be
happier with no labels, but I guess we'll have to deal with that when we
get there.

<p> I looked into the LED thing, but was missing a necessary component
before I could make any real progress.  The bulbs are of the variety
that just seat straight down into their holder, with the leads folded up
against the body -- there's no metal base or anything.  I need to find
something that will duplicate the glass of the bulb for the LED.  I
suspect that something like thin plexiglass would work pretty well.
Work on that is proceeding.

<td> I discovered today, much to my dissappointment, that there's
gasoline dripping out of the carbs on my R100.  The reason I'm
dissappointed is that I had set the floats exactly as described in the
Clymer's manual, and they're still overfilling.  It can't be by much, as
the gasoline only comes out enough to dampen the bottom of the
carbeuretor.

<p> Thankfully, Bob Fleischer (one of the more learned members of the
Airheads list) sent me an updated adjustment method, which involves
actually leaving the carbs on the bike (yay!).  I'll try that out
tonight.

<p> I got the LED's from Fairchild Semi last night, and will hopefully
have some time this weekend to play around with those.  They look like
they'll work just fine for the indicator lamps -- I'm more interested in
seeing how they work as general illumination.

<p> Other than that whole "dripping gasoline" thing (which may also be
impacting my gas mileage -- I'm not sure how much is dripping out), the
R bike seems to be running pretty well.  The idle is still low, which is
annoying when the bike is cold, but not a problem other than that.  The
charging system is weak, but that's a well-known problem for these
beasts, and as time allows, I'll be going through and cleaning
connections and replacing bits to fix that up.
