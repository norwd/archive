<td> I decided to start keeping an online journal of
thoughts about motorcycle stuff.  I have no idea if I'll keep it up.
Check back occasionally to see if I do.

<p> I've got a <a href =
"http://neko.mi.org/~tawollen/pictures/motorcycles/specs-sabre.jpg">1984 
Honda Sabre V65</a> as a loaner bike while <strike>my
bank account is being sucked dry</strike> my bike is being serviced at
<a href="http://www.cascadebmw.com/">Cascade</a>.  It's a big monster of
a bike that likes to go really fast.  I'm going to put up a review here at
some point in the near future.  If you can't see graphics, that Honda
link above basically says that this bike is faster than lightning, with
a 3.04 second 0-60, with an 11.2 second quarter mile at 121.69 MPH --
that's just about double my normal K75.

<p> I just posted the new service log entry for the spline lube, new
clutch, and level II service for the K75.  The clutch is actually kind
of a surprise to me -- I had no idea I needed one, but somehow having a
vehicle serviced always turns up another $400 worth of work that needs
to be done.  And this service is indeed being done in $400 increments:
$406 for the spline lube (damn that ABS -- adds $60 or so to the price),
$415 or so for the level II, and $350ish for clutch parts.  Hopefully
the level II and splibe lube can share some labor and cut down the cost
a bit.  I'll update the entry when it's actually done and paid for.

<p> I had been thinking about getting a second bike of the <a href =
"http://www.airheads.org">Airhead persuasion</a>, but after hearing
about that bill, I think I'll be waiting a bit.

<td> Man.  Taking my bike back and riding it off the lot, it felt like
someone had removed the guts with a sledgehammer.  Suddenly, my K75,
which I thought of as such a speedy bike, felt like a Yugo.  It's all
that Honda's fault.  Silly 1100 cc, 101 HP, 3.04 second 0-60 brute. But
I'm slowly getting over it, and getting back into the "it's good enough
for me" groove.  The BMW is certainly easier to ride in traffic.

<p> Installing the brake pads myself was an interesting experience.  I'm
not a stranger to vehicle maintenance, but I haven't done much on
motorcycles.  I had the engine out of my Bug several times, as well as a
diesel Dasher with a cracked block.  But still, it's been a while since
I've done any serious wrenching, so it took a bit of effort to get back
into the mindset.  Reading through the brakepad replacement procedure in
the book, it looked very straightforward.  In fact, it <i>was</i> very
straightforward, which was nice.  I got the new pads in with minimal
fuss.

<p> I did notice, however, that the brake fluid pushed out of the
calipers and up into the reservoir was fairly dark and murky.  Makes me
question what exactly it was Cascade did when they replaced the front
brake fluid -- granted, the fluid in the reservoir was shiny and clean,
but i can't help wondering if they really bled all the old fluid out.
