<th> May 4, 2001 </th>
<td> It's been a full and exciting time lately.  I spent all last
weekend fixing things on the new <a href="../galleries/r100s/index.html">R100</a>,
as detailed in the <a href="../r100s-servicelog.html">servicelog</a>.  I
was still stumped what was causing the misfiring cylinder condition
(running along fine on the freeway, suddenly one cylinder would stop
firing, in extreme cases both would stop -- they'd both come back if I
slowed down and got off the freeway, then it'd act normal).

<p> I hit on my discovery on my way across I-90 to the vehicle
inspection station east of Bellevue.  I was headed up the hill towards
Mercer Island, when the cylinder misfired again, and I was conveniently
very close to an exit, so I just pulled off.  I found a relatively safe
place to stop, and turned off the bike.  Checking the float bowls, I
didn't find anything wrong (no water, no crud, fuel was present).  I
knew I wouldn't see it in the spark, since the bike ran fine at low
speeds.

<p> I had flipped the left fuel tap to reserve as I was exiting, hoping
that would help.  It didn't really help, but I did get a little blip of
power, which possibly jogged my memory a bit.  After standing there
perplexed for a bit, I unscrewed the gas cap about half way, and decided
to try going the rest of the way.  Sure enough, I made it to Bellevue
and back without any further trouble: the gas cap wasn't venting to let
any air in!  The fuel would exit the tank at a rate faster than the
incoming air, and create a lower pressure area inside the tank.  The
outside air pressure would then prevent the fuel from coming out (it's
only gravity fed, there aren't any fuel pumps involved), causing the
fuel starvation that was killing the engine at speed.

<p> So, that is conquered, at least.  At this point, the only serious
problem left is the clutch.  I tried adjusting it last night and today,
and no matter how much free play I leave, it still slips.  I'll know
more tonight when I ride home, and have a chance to try getting the
clutch to slip more.  When I tried the method outlined in the Clymers
manual, it was obvious that something was way out of alignment, since
their method would have had the clutch most of the way disengaged even
with the lever all the way out.  That's probably the cable, though.  The
clutch itself may or may not really have problems.  I'll have it in to
Cascade tomorrow, and if they can't get it adjusted properly, then
Joshua has said he'll replace the clutch.  (But he wants me to ride down
to Olympia to do it -- a 1.5 hour ride one way, on a clutch that might
give out at any time, and valves that I don't trust.)

<p> So, the valves.  I started the bike on Thursday, and let it idle for
a bit before riding off.  After perhaps 10-20 seconds, I heard a loud
"tap" from the left head, and I'm afraid that one of the valves
(probably the exhaust valve) was stuck open -- how long has it had this
problem?  (The same thing happened on the right cylinder at one point,
although that was an adjustment problem, not the valve binding up as I
fear this was.)  On the other hand, how did it run on both cylinders if
the exhaust valve was hanging open enough to make a tap noise that loud?
I may be jumping at shadows.

<p> Anyway, that's where things are at this point.  More as I know it.
Some day, I'll have to sleep, too.  (My schedule is way too busy
lately.)

<td> A great flap arose today on the Airheads list, when I posted the
latest news (there was a bunch of water in the transmission of the R100S
when Cascade had it apart for a new clutch).  A member of the list
indirectly accused me of being a "snivelling whiner," and I took it
pretty hard.  I thanked everyone who'd offered help, and unsubscribed
from the list.  Basically, I don't need to listen to that kind of abuse.
I like the list, it's full of great stuff, but it's high traffic, and
the "fuck off, you asshole" factor can get pretty high.

<p> However, I got about 10 messages afterwards saying "don't go," which
is a pretty stirring response to me.  I expected to maybe get one or
two, but I'm frankly kind of overwhelmed.  I resubscribed just now, but
I don't know that I'm going to post anything real soon -- no tinder, no
fire.

<p> So, anyway, mailing list politics aside, the bike is in at Cascade
for a clutch replacement, half funded by Joshua.  This is a tremendous
thing, and I'm quite appreciative to Joshua for his help with this.  It
shows that his heart is really in the right place.

<p> On the other hand, I'm never going to buy anything this major sight
unseen again.  It was a tremendous mistake, and I could have saved
myself a lot of heartache by figuring out how to get down to LA to look
at the bike myself.

<p> Cascade called me today, and said that the input shaft seal needs to
be replaced, and that there was "a lot of water in the transmission."  I
got some clarification on that, and was not really pleased with the
answer.  Most likely, the speedo cable boot was leaking like a sieve (I
should have kept the old one to take a picture of), and during the 3
years the bike spent on its side-stand, a bunch of water got in and
probably rusted a ring around the top of the tranny.  There's no way to
tell what damage was done without cracking the tranny case and looking
(unless someone wants to loan me a good fiber optic bore scope type
camera).  I'm not sure what I can do about this except live with it and
hope nothing major breaks.

<p> So, I'll go pick up the bike tomorrow, and it should have a nice new
clutch in it.  I'll finally be able to ride it with a bit of verve!
Doubtless I'll soon have a report as to how it feels to have a 1000 cc
bike that I can actually utilize most of the power on.

<td> Indeed, new clutch!  Whee!

<p> It was so nice to finally be able to goose the throttle and feel the
response instead of just hearing it as the motor spun up and left the
transmission behind...  This brings on all sorts of smiles, since the
R100 <i>is</i> a powerful bike, and likes to go fast.

<p> I noticed that the voltmeter wasn't looking too happy on the way
home from work.  It was hovering around the 12.2 volt mark, which
probably means more like 13.2 -- I still need to get out there and test
the running voltage at the battery.  But anyway, I suspect that the
electrical system still needs some attention before it's going to be
happy.  At this point, I think that means taking off the front cover of
the engine (note to self, disconnect battery first!) and cleaning
contacts on the diode board, replacing the alternator brushes, and
generally inspecting; and opening up the headlight (an excellent excuse
to replace the parking light) and doing the same -- clean and grease.

<p> Tomorrow is the Tech Day, up in Snohomish, I think.  I have
directions in my tank bag, and shall review them before I head up, but
it should certainly be interesting.  I'm hoping, as I believe I've said
before, to get a new tang welded on the centerstand, and to balance the
carbs.  I don't know what the format is, but I'm hoping it'll be a
"here's how you do it, now you try" kinda thing.  I'm sure I'll write
something about it when I get back.

<td> Well, the Tech Day was indeed a lot of fun.  I arrived at around 11
AM, having taken time to eat breakfast and prepare for the event -- a
rarity for me these days.  The ride wasn't as far as I had feared,
especially since my motorcycle didn't crap out in any way....  Broken
motorcycles make any trip longer. ;)

<p> I arrived to find Dave Cavanaugh's house and considerable shop in
the midst of the woods, with a group of perhaps 8 motorcycles already
parked in front.  When I got there, there were perhaps 2 or three GSes,
one other S conversion (an R80), an RT or two, and a few /7's.  There
was also, for some inexplicable reason, a Harley with a "For sale" sign
taped to the back of the topbox.

<p> I dismounted and introduced myself around.  I won't pretend I can
remember more than a few names, but I met everyone who was there, and
greeted more people as they arrived.  There was already Dave's R90/6 up
on a stand, halfway apart.  I think the first R65 of the day was going
up on the other stand as I got there.

<p> I spent some time wandering around and taking pictures of things
with my little Olympus half-frame camera (loaded with black and white
film, since I didn't have any color slow enough to use in a camera that
old -- of course, it was a moot point, I forgot to reset the film speed
on the camera anyway.. sigh).  When those are developed and printed,
I'll put a few of them up here.

<p> At some point during the day, perhaps around 1 PM, I pulled the
center stand off my bike to have Dave weld on new footpads and a new
tang.  He kept getting interrupted by other things (hosting any kind of
party is a lot of work, and he was hosting really well), so it took a
while, but when I rode away, I had a significantly-repaired stand, with
new 1/8 inch footpads and a new, perfect-looking tang.  He even let me
use some of his generic black spraypaint to spruce up the stand after I
cleaned 18 years of caked on oil and dirt off it.

<p> In the process of taking the stand off, I learned two things.  The
first was a cool trick for taking springs off: wedge coins inbetween the
coils to help expand it a bit.  The second thing I learned was that the
bushings on this bike were <i>shot</i>.  They were easily 2 or 3 mm out
of round, with a rounded flat spot on one side, and a good looking curve
on the other.  I'll be acquiring new ones soon, and this will hopefully
also cure the bike of its habit of sitting back too far on the stand.

<p> Kevin Beretta was there with his TwinMax, and did an impromptu demo
of balancing carburetors on my bike when I got back from a quick warm-up
ride.  He had a devil of a time getting the idle to balance, and we
eventually determined that my one missing starter jet was the cause
(it's a little brass jet that sits in the little well at the corner of
each float bowl -- look down there next time you have your float bowl
off).  He did get the higher-speed balance set, though.  I need to get a
new jet and try rebalancing the carbs.

<p> So, that was the extent of my actual technical participation in the
Tech Day, but lots of other stuff was happening.  There was one guy (and
I apologize again for forgetting damn near everyone's name) who did a
spline lube on his R65LS; there was a bearing replacement clinic that I
missed most of; Stephen (toastertan5@aol.com I think) had an R75 engine
there sans jugs, which got measured for some crankshaft tolerances;
Lauren Bish had his bike half way apart in big chunks to replace the
exhaust 2-into-1 pipe; about 15 carb balances happened.  It was a full,
interesting, and really fun day.

<p> On top of all that, Dave laid out a really nice barbecue spread,
with three or four different varieties of grillables (including garden
burgers, thanks Dave!), baked beans, all the pop or beer you could
consume, five varieties of potato and corn chip, etc.  His wife also
brought out some excellent cupcakes and a sort of cookie pizza (imagine
a 1 foot diameter cookie cut radially like a pizza).  All of it was
delicious, and I contributed all the money I had on me ($10) to the food
donations kitty.

<p> I also grabbed a parts CD from the stack that either Dave or an
earlier arrival had brought -- once I get that installed, I should be
able to browse through all the parts on the motorcycle and look at part
numbers, which will be <i>really</i> nice.  That should help with future
repairs.

<p> This is hardly a complete report, but it's all I have time for.  I
had a <b>great</b> time, and look forward to the next one.  If you read
this, Dave, <b>thank you!</b>  You provided an excellent location for an
excellent Tech Day.

<th> May 30, 2001 </th>
<td> So, I've been riding the K75 a lot, as I've been taking flying
lessons down at Tacoma Narrows.  This necessitates that I carry a
certain amount of stuff with me (normal shoulder bag plus flight bag),
and there's no storage space on the R100S.  But something I've noticed
recently is that the suspension on the K bike is feeling pretty weird.
The front wheel dances on some kinds of pavement (southbound on 99, just
coming off the viaduct, for instance); the rear end doesn't feel firmly
planted in corners, as if the tire is flat; there's a strange wobbly
sensation, accompanied by a thunk I can feel in the pegs, but not with
my ears.

<p> The tire pressure is fine on both tires (between 40 and 43 while
cold), and the only thing I can think of is that the amount of weight
I'm carrying is affecting the feel.  I had been used to carrying about
10 pounds in the left bag, and perhaps 2 or 3 in the right bag, but am
now carrying more like 15-20 in the right bag, and 10 in the left.  I
guess I need to take the bags off and ride around, to see if I still
have the problem (but then, I'd rather be riding the R bike if I'm not
going to have any storage).  I just wish it didn't feel like something
is loose (nothing is, that I can tell).

<p> I finally got a chance to ride the R bike today, after nearly a
week.  I clearly need to do something about the missing starter jet, as
the bike won't idle until it's warm, and according to Kevin Beretta, the
idle will suck until that jet is put back in.  So I was thinking of
taking a bit of time at "lunch" today (I had a lunchtime meeting) and
going to the dealer to get that jet, as well as some centerstand
spacers, and possibly just an entire carb rebuild kit (although it'd be
awfully nice to not have to pull the carbs again).
