<h2> 1983 R100S from Parts Haus </h2>

<p><img src="images/r100s-partshaus.jpg">

<p> This is a picture of the motorcycle Parts Haus advertised on Ebay on
4/2/01 that so piqued my interest.  Here's the text of his Ebay ad:

<p><code> New paint and hand pinstriping,New seat,New windshield,New battery,New
BMW S-mirrors,Good tires,Master cylinder replaced,New steering head
bearings,Dual Brembo front brakes, Carbs rebuilt,Bike looks and runs
great,Needs riden, Summer is upon us. Can be shipped to most major cities
in a crate for $375.00 Any????? please call 562 426 3558 The Parts Haus
</code>

<p> Bidding was set to start at $2999, but the bike didn't receive any
bids.

<p> When I spoke to Joshua at Parts Haus, he said that this is an R100RT
that got converted to an S, and that it's been sitting unridden for
about three years.  He also said that it has either 69,000 or 70,000
miles on it (I didn't hear that part clearly, and 1000 miles doesn't
make much difference at that point).

<p> <b>Update:</b> (5/3/01) I've bought the bike, as later journal
entries show.  It's in ok shape, but had a bunch of problems I had not
expected based on the ride reports I got from people in LA.  Such is
life.
