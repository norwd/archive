<td> I've been checking out Moto Guzzis a bit more recently, thinking
about them as a possible brand for a rapidly-departing second bike.
Since having to replace the furnace (to the tune of $2500), the idea of
getting a second bike has kind of gotten further away.  I had originally
intended to get a R100S from Cascade in January, but waited a bit too
long, and it was sold.  I still think about that bike, and regret that I
waited too long.

<p> I think if I were to seriously consider a Moto Guzzi, it'd be either
a Le Mans MkIII or a Mille GT.  The Le Mans MkIII is a 850 cc bike, sort
of on the sport side of a standard.  The Mille GT is basically a Le Mans
MkV, with a 1000 cc engine instead of 850.

<p> One of the main reasons I like the idea of Moto Guzzis (still
haven't ridden one) is that they're much like BMWs: simple, two cylinder
(90 degree V instead of 180 degree pancake, but same basic ide), shaft
drive beasties.  They're relatively simple, and don't pretend to be race
replicas or anything like that.

<p> Anyway, that's the extent of my thoughts for today.  Some day, I'll
get in more of the habit of keeping a journal.

<td> I found a <a href="partshaus-bike.html">nice looking
R100S</a> on Ebay on Friday, and am now in a real dilemma as to whether
to buy it or not.  I checked in with the <a
href="http://www.airheads.org/faq.html#list">Airheads mailing list</a>
to see if anyone wanted to go testride the bike for me, and I've gotten
a few positive responses.  I think Parts Haus is open again on Tuesday,
but I may be able to arrange something so one of the volunteers can go
ride it on Monday.

<p> The first part of the dilemma is that I can't really see myself
buying a motorcycle without having had a chance to ride it around and
consider it pretty seriously.  With something that's 18 years old, and
had 69000 miles on it, you have to stop and wonder how many times it's
been crashed, rear-ended, dropped, and/or plunged in tanks of boiling
acid, not to mention all the other abuse that can be dished out to a
motorcycle without doing such drastic things.

<p> The second part of the dilemma is that I'm not sure I want to buy
another bike right now.  I mean, I was all prepared to buy a '77 R100S
from <a href="http://www.cascadebmw.com/">Cascade</a> in January, and it
was bought by someone else before I got to it; I still regret that.
But at the same time, I just had to buy a furnace, to the tune of $2500,
and I'm not sure spending $3500 on an unknown bike is a prudent move.

<p> On the positive side, I just got off the phone with one of my
testride volunteers, who says he'd even be willing to take the bike in
to another dealer for a lemon check (inspection to make sure there's
nothing obviously wrong with it).  This costs about $100 here in
Seattle, and is the best insurance you can get with a used vehicle.  I'm
still marvelling at the little enthusiast communities (like the <a
href="http://www.airheads.org/">Airheads</a>) that spring up on the
Internet.

<td> I have now chatted several times with Joshua at Parts Haus, and
things sound encouraging.  Mark, one of the Airheads test-ride volunteers,
was there when I called, and Joshua said that if we found anything wrong
with the bike, he'd rather just fix it than pass it on to me broken
(at least, that's what I think I heard).  We'll see what exactly happens
with that.  Joshua said he'd be gone from noon today until Wednesday
evening, so probably no really new info will come to me until after that
(although I hope to get the ride report soon, possibly with digital
pictures).

<td> Just got off the phone with Joshua again, and it sounds like things
are all set.  An inspection found the compression in the right cylinder
to be quite low, and a leakdown confirmed that the exhaust valve is
leaking a lot.  It may just be an adjustment, or it might be something
else, but I don't think it's enough to really freak out about.  The
inspection also found some dead rubber bits (speedo boot, intake tubes,
etc.)  Joshua's going to have Matthias (his preferred mechanic) adjust
the valves to try and fix up that right cylinder.

<p> I'm getting pretty excited about this, and will be thrilled when I
finally get to the point of buying it and unpacking it in Seattle.  I
still have to ask about how the bike is shipped -- whether it's
significantly taken apart -- to see if I can ride it away from SeaTac,
or if I have to acquire a truck of some variety.

<p> But, in all, it looks like a "go."

<td> Well, I've agreed to buy the bike.  I talked to Joshua, and he said
that the valve adjustment fixed the compression problem; he also said
that no one except the dealer has been able to notice the bent rear rim,
so I'm inclined to think it's not a big deal.

<p> It should be shipped on Wednesday or so, and takes four days to get
from LA to Seattle, so I should see it in a week on Monday.  That's
pretty exciting.  Rest assured, pictures will be posted within a few
days for anyone interested.

<p> Joshua said that the bike will be in basically rideable condition
when it arrives, and will have at most the mirrors, windshield, and
front wheel removed for shipping.  So, I should be able to get by with a
basic set of tools, and it will have at least a small amount of gas in
it.  Changing the brake fluid and engine oil are near the top of my list
of "things to do," as well as look at the tranny oil and probably change
it.

<p> The bike is missing its stock toolkit (and maybe the tool tray as
well, I don't recall) so I'll be needing to replace that.  Joshua said
he occasionally gets toolkits together, but that he charges $60 and it's
for used tools -- the new $90 variety are better, so I'll just get one
of those.

<p> And, thanks to the wonder that is the internet, I just bought a
<a href =
"http://www.motobins.co.uk/cgi-bin/displayprod.cgi?show|243a|">toolkit</a>
from <a href="http://www.motobins.co.uk">Motobins</a> in the UK for a
mere $67 (plus whatever shipping turns out to be).  All while typing up
this journal entry.

<p> I'm looking forward to this whole new bike thing.  New toys are so
cool.

<td> That toolkit from Motobins turned out to be about as expensive as I
was expecting -- with GBP19.00 shipping (about $28), it ends up being
$94 and change.  Ah well.  But after all that, I'll have a shiny new
toolkit.  And, (brainstorm alert) since Parts Haus is a (get this) used
parts retailer, I asked Joshua to send me a tooltray along as well!  $10
from him, versus $25 at my local dealer.  Plus, no (extra) shipping.
It's all good when you're having an entire 500lb motorcycle sent.

<p> The bike should ideally be arriving Monday or Tuesday, although I
won't be able to pick it up until Tuesday (this is all assuming the
shipper is open fairly late, like after 9 pm), since I've got my first
groundschool lesson Monday.  (That's probably a subject for a different
journal.)

<p> Like I said before, pictures will be forthcoming as soon as I have
to bike and a digital camera in the same place at the same time.

<th> Apr 25, 2001 </th>
<td> Well, I picked up the new bike last night at Forward Air.  It came
in a BMW branded crate, as promised, and looked to be in fine shape.
The windscreen and mirrors were in a box, wrapped up in bubblewrap for
the journey.  Once I figured out how to get the crate apart (many
drywall screws and a good 15 minutes with a crowbar later), I checked
the gas and oil (both fine) and started it up.  Took a bit of cranking,
but it was sitting for a while, and the battery may need to be topped
up.  Anyway, it started without too much fuss, and I was able to roll it
out of the remainder of the crate.

<p> With minimal fuss, I got it on the road.  The mirrors are wonky
beyond belief, and I haven't yet gotten them aligned such that I can
actually see anything behind me.  It may be that the handlebars are not
sitting at the right angle or something.  I think I'm going to get
<a href="http://www.sporttwin.com/Qstore/p000082.htm">Napoleon Barend
mirrors</a> for it anyway, I prefer that style.

<p> After stopping at a gas station just to make sure I wouldn't run out
on the 25ish mile journey home, we were underway.  I had my girlfriend
driving the car behind me, in case anything went horribly wrong.  But
all seemed to be fine.

<p> The clutch felt a bit strange to me, like I couldn't figure out
where it started engaging.  However, I was willing to discount that as
being a different bike and just not being used to it.  We got out of the
Kent valley, and up to the freeway.  There was one interruption when the
chase car got stuck behind a poorly timed traffic light, so I pulled
over to the side to wait for her.  The light turned green (fortunately
there wasn't much traffic), and I pulled back into the road -- then it
hit me, as the clutch slipped for a full "one-one-thousand" count after
I let go of the lever.  The clutch is nearly dead, or coated in oil, or
something.

<p> So, with that weighing on my mind, we headed up to I-5, and merged
into traffic.  Naturally, I couldn't see anything behind me, because the
mirrors were pointed up at the stars, but if I leaned waaay forward I
could just get a glimpse of traffic behind me.  The bike didn't feel
terribly powerful, but I wasn't pushing very hard, not wanting to press
my luck at 10 pm on a major freeway.

<p> However, when we got past the 405 onramp, and the freeway started
aiming uphill, I noticed one of the cylinders cutting out.  It felt
almost exactly the same as when I had previously ridden a bike with
water in the tank, so I figured it might well be water.  We kept going
for another few miles, with me hoping this was some problem that would
clear itself up after a short while.  The bike kept surging
intermittently, as the affected cylinder got fuel or spark, or whatever
was lacking.

<p> We got off the freeway at Albro, having just barely kept pace with a
semi going up the previous hill.  I pulled onto a residential street and
stopped at an approximately safe looking place, in order to check the
float bowls for water.  As I pulled each bowl, I saw that the left one
was sort of dirty looking, with white "flocking" in the bowl (I'll get a
picture tonight and post it) -- I'm guessing that was due to water being
there at some point, but there didn't seem to be any now.  The right one
looked fine.  Obviously (although this didn't occur to me until later)
the bike had spent a lot of time on its sidestand.  (And indeed, the
centerstand is missing its tang, and appears to be worn all the way
through on the bottom.)

<p> So, I put it all back together, and turned the fuel back on.
Immediately, the left carb started pouring out fuel.  I had thought
maybe that bowl went on a bit loosely -- sure enough, no gasket.  This
caused some consternation, as I was worried that I might actually run
out of gas (I had put 3.5 gallons in at the station) from the leak
before I could get home.  In the end, I duct-taped a garbage back to my
left foot to keep it from getting soaked, and we headed back out.

<p> The rest of the journey was spent with one cylinder working.  If I
ever let the throttle go down from "full" I'd start slowing down
(although the non-firing cylinder came back at lower RPM).  I had also
noticed that the bike was idling strangely, probably due to the left
side throttle cable, which was sticking, or something.

<p> When finally we got home, I crawled out of my riding clothes and
into the shower to get some of the gasoline smell off me.  Riding with
only half an engine is a frightening experience -- I never knew if the
engine was going to keep running or not, or what was wrong, etc.

<p> This morning I went to look at it again, and things looked a bit
better.  I got the bike up on the centerstand (which I see has worn all
the way through where it contacts the ground), and surveyed things.  The
left carb still leaks, but there's no gasket, so that's to be expected.
The inline fuel filters looked perfectly clean, but I noticed that the
right side petcock only dribbles fuel through it, so it may well be
clogged.  The left side petcock is damp with gasoline around the
threads, so I'm guessing it needs a new gasket.

<p> I looked at the left rear turn signal, which wasn't blinking last
night.  Still not working, although the bulb looks perfect.  I'll try
swapping them tonight, but I suspect that the wiring is broken
somewhere.  I'll have a lot more time tonight to sit around with a
multimeter and measure a few things.

<p> Looking at the bike in good light, it really is in fine shape.
There's almost no rust anywhere to be seen (the only rust I found was a
light amount on the muffler support tangs near the passenger pegs).  The
paint is indeed brand new as promised, and I understand from talking to
Joshua this morning that it's a tank he had on his wall, and was put on
after the RT -&gt; S conversion.  The fairing looks (and probably is)
brand new.

<p> I had noticed last night that the voltmeter was reading about 12.5 -
13 volts instead of the 13.5 - 14 I'd like to see, but I understand that
those things read notoriously low.  I'll check that out tonight.

<p> According to numerous replies I received after posting my harrowing
journey on the Airheads mailing list, I should be concentrating on the
fuel system rather than the ignition system.  This is somewhat
heartening, as the fuel system is simpler in its way than the electrics
(much easier to find a clogged filter screen than an intermittent
connection).  I will still need to drain the tank, and I might as well
take it off at the same time to get a good look at the systems under the
tank (and it'll make replacing the throttle cable much easier).  It's a
pity the previous owner used nylon zip ties on the fuel lines rather
than hose clamps -- sure, they stay on tight, but getting them off
without damaging the fuel hoses is difficult.  I guess I'll invest in a
dozen or so 1/2 inch hose clamps.

<p> I was happy to hear Joshua say that he'll get me a new clutch if
that turns out to be a real problem.  He said I should go to a guy in
Olympia (perhaps 1 or 1.5 hours away in light traffic) for the clutch
swap, and he'll pay for it.  I guess we'll see what happens with that
once I get the missing cylinder problem sorted out.  That will be
extremely pleasing if it works out that way, as I was having some pretty
dark thoughts last night as I held the throttle wide open to maintain my
paltry 55 MPH on a dark and busy freeway.

<p> So, that's me written-out for now.  I'll probably have more tonight
after poking around with some new gaskets.  I should probably acquire a
gas can for that whole tank-draining thing...

<p> Oh, and one last thing.  I've got a digital camera tonight, so I'll
have a few pictures up in the gallery in the next few days.
