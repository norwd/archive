<td> I finally got around to changing the oil on the R100 this weekend.
What a frustrating experience.  I got started in the late afternoon on
Saturday, thinking I could easily finish up by that evening, and take a
look at the diode board and alternator the next day.

<p> I drained out the oil, and poked around the oil filter, to see if I
could get it out without taking off the exhaust system.  Turns out I
couldn't, so I went to a local dealer and bought the ridiculously
expensive exhaust nut wrench ($54 before tax).  I have to say though,
actually having the right tool for the job is <i>really</i> nice.

<p> I got the filter out, and liberated the new filter from its dusty
box, only to discover that it looked a bit different from the old one.
The old one was about an inch longer, and had an attached O-ring only on
one end, where the new one had them on both ends.  The new filter also
didn't come with the right set of gaskets, missing a black one.

<p> I scampered inside and took a look at <a
href="http://www.airheads.org/contrib/oring.html">The $2000 O-ring</a>
(an article about how to install the oil filter correctly).  This just
left me more confused, because the situation I had didn't seem to be
addressed at all.  I shot off an email describing my problem to <a
href="mailto:snowbum@jps.net">Da Bum</a>, and we quickly determined that
I had the wrong filter (which I might have figured out if I had bothered
to check the BMW part number the first time around).  That pretty much
ended things for the night, since it was 8 PM by that time.
Fortunately, both of the local dealerships are open on Sunday, so I
wasn't in too much trouble.

<p> A quick trip to <a href="http://www.ridewest.com">Ride West</a> the
next day, to exchange the filter (having bought what they told me was
the right filter there a number of weeks earlier), and pick up some
oil cooler crush washers, and I thought I was set.  Now having the
correct oil filter, I put it all back together, and was getting ready
to reattach the oil cooler when I discovered they had given me the wrong
crush washers.  Word on the street is that reusing crush washers is just
dumb -- they cost $.60 apiece, and are not worth scrimping on.  So, I
clambered back in the car, and went back to the dealership again.  Feh.
They exchanged the washers without fuss (I would have been really unhappy
if there was any problem with the exchange, and probably would have made
my unhappiness vocally known).  It all went back together without any
further problem, thankfully.

<p> A quick ride around the block and all looked good.  I don't suspect
I've actually caused the thermostat to open up yet, so the cooler is
probably still empty, I'll have to check the oil level again after a
ride on the freeway or when the ambient temperature heats up a bit.
