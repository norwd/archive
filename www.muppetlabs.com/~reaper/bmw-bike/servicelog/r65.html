<h2> Service Log </h2>

<p> I'm keeping a log of all the service that I'm having done or doing
to this motorcycle, and I figured I could keep it online just as easily.
I have no idea if this will be helpful to anyone other than myself.

</tr>

<tr>
<td> Nov 13, 99 </td>
<td> ~39,400 </td>
<td> Pre-purchase inspection - check to make sure nothing was
wrong before buying the bike </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
<td> Didn't find anything drastically wrong, but compression in the left
cylinder (I think) was just below the "good" threshold, at ~120 PSI </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Dec 11, 99 </td>
<td> 39,615 </td>
<td> Diagnose and repair electrical fault - Generator light glows very
faintly all the time. Replace alternator rotor. </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
<td> Discovered that the alternator rotor was starting to separate, and
was grounding itself out. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Dec 11, 99 </td>
<td> 39,618 </td>
<td> Again with the Gen light, but this time it glows strongly all the
time. Replace regulator. </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
<td> The voltage regulator went out while riding away from the
dealership, probably due to the rejuvenated alternator. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Feb 11, 00 </td>
<td> 40,245 </td>
<td> <a href="r65-gallery2/images/DCP00414.JPG">Install new Koni rear
shocks</a> </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Ride height went up at least an inch, and shock dampening appears
to be greatly improved.  Further impressions as I get more miles on
them.  Now it's very obvious that I need to do something about the front
springs and dampening... ;) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Feb 20, 00 </td>
<td> 40,340 </td>
<td> Adjust valves </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Valves were really tight (as in, I couldn't get the feeler gauge
in to check) -- this will hopefully have a positive effect on my gas
mileage, which has been rather low, at around 34-35 MPG.  This may also
have been the reason for the low cylinder compression in the prepurchase
inspection.  Bike starts better, and feels a little bit smoother.
Acceleration has not perceptibly changed, but low-end torque feels a
bit better.  The right valve cover still makes a distinct ticking noise
when cold.
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Mar 29, 00 </td>
<td> ~40,670 </td>
<td> Replace clutch (includes replacing seals and o-rings, and lubing
splines).  </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
<td> The clutch had been getting less grippy over the last week or two,
including slipping for a second under harder acceleration -- given the
mileage, this was the time to do it.  The mechanic found that both
engine seals had started to leak oil, and the clutch was starting to get
soaked -- it was also nearly worn out.  The neutral switch was also
replaced, as it was apparently starting to leak as well. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Apr 8, 00 </td>
<td> 40,860 </td>
<td> Engine oil and filter change </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> None </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Apr 25, 00 </td>
<td> 41,030 </td>
<td> Replace brake fluid - front brakes </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Learned the hard way that fluid will seep past the threads when
using a regular tube (and that the particular one-way-valve tube I
picked up a Schucks wasn't worth the plastic it was stamped out of).
Using a vacuum pump was much more effective.  The fluid had obviously
not been replaced for a year or two, since it was dark brown and had
swirling particulate matter in the bottom of the reservoir. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> May 9, 00 </td>
<td> 41,255 </td>
<td> Replace spark plugs </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Replaced Bosch W6DC's (wrong plug; according to service manuals W5D
is correct) with NGK plugs as spec'd in the NGK guides -- couldn't find
Bosch plugs where I was.  The plugs looked to be in decent shape, but
sooty; this combined with the engine dying upon moderate braking
suggests a too-rich mixture, and possibly a bit of water in the float
bowls.  A carb rebuild is probably called for, and a re-sync is
definitely called for.</td>

<p> I also got some service information from the dealer, detailing
things they had done before I bought the bike.

<tr>
<td> Jul 9, 97 </td>
<td> 37,948 </td>
<td> Rebuild rear drive, install new rear tire, rebuild master cylinder </td>
<td> Buckingham BMW (now Ride West BMW) </td>
<td> Mounted Dunlop Elite 491 120/90 rear tire. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Unknown </td>
<td> 38,215 </td>
<td> Prepurchase inspection </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
<td> Apparently this inspection found a number of leaks, and that the
choke cable needed to be replaced.  The cable was replaced, and
apparently the leaks were fixed, as I have not seen one drop of oil come
out of this bike. </td>

<tr>
<td> Unknown </td>
<td> ~38,250 </td>
<td> Level 2 service </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
<td> I'm not sure what's included in a Level 2 service, but it's
apparently a well-known designation. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Unknown </td>
<td> ~38,250 </td>
<td> Replace front tire and choke cable </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
