<h2> Service Log </h2>

<p> I'm keeping a log of all the service that I'm having done or doing
to this motorcycle, and I figured I could keep it online just as easily.
I have no idea if this will be helpful to anyone other than myself.

<tr>
<td> Apr 17, 2001 </td>
<td> Unknown (around 70,850) </td>
<td> Pre-purchase inspection </td>
<td> Marty's BMW (Los Angeles) </td>
<td> Needs new: speedo cable boot, intake fittings.  Found the rear rim
is "slightly" bent, starter needs to be lubed.  Right cylinder leaked
100% in a leakdown test (through the exhaust valve), left 12%.  Right
cylinder 100 psi in compression test, left 120.  Stiff throttle cable.

<p> I was personally not pleased with the apparent effort that went into
the inspection, as they missed a really gummed up carb, and slipping
clutch(!). </td>

<td> Apr 27-29, 2001 </td>
<td> 70,915 </td>
<td> Post-purchase repairs </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Replaced: throttle cable; speedo cable boot; petcocks; spark plug
wires; floats; float pivot pins; float valves; fuel line; intake
hose-stubs.  Cleaned the carbs.  Cleaned up and lubed the throttle
chain cam and mechanism.  Replaced the stock S mirrors with Napoleon
bar-ends.  Inspected the clutch adjustment (needs to be more thoroughly
checked and possibly adjusted).  Inspected the air filter, and vacuumed
it out. </td>

<td> May 5, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,010 </td>
<td> Clutch adjustment </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
<td> Adjusted the clutch to see if it's really slipping, or just poorly
adjusted.  It's really slipping. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> May 6, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,030 </td>
<td> More post-purchase repair </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Replaced the clutch cable (although the old one looked fine, so I
saved it out) and choke cables.  Cleaning out the choke lever housing on
the handlebar produced <i>amazing</i> results -- it feels like brand new,
clicks into position perfectly. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> May 17, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,106 </td>
<td> Clutch and input shaft seal replacement </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
<td> Pretty standard, they also reported that the drive splines are 50%
worn. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> May 19, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,180 </td>
<td> Tech day repairs </td>
<td> Dave Cavanaugh, Kevin Beretta, Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Re-welded the centerstand with new footpads (it was worn entirely
through before), and added a tang.  Balanced the carbeuretors. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Jun 1, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,311 </td>
<td> Replaced left float bowl </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Had to replace the whole float bowl just to replace the little
starter jet/choke jet that's pressed into the bowl.  Ah well, that one
needed to be replaced anyway. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Jun 3, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,362 </td>
<td> Relettered idiot lights, replaced indicator bulbs </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Took off the instrument pod to replace the tach face light, and
ended up replacing all the bulbs and the gasket.  Also relettered
the idiot light labels with enamel so I can read them again.

<tr>
<td> Jun 6, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,362 </td>
<td> Replaced front brake pads, centerstand spacers, instrument lights,
instrument light carrier </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Replaced moderately worn stock front pads with new EBC pads, since I
liked them so much on the K75.  Replaced the centerstand spacers, since
they were as much as 2mm out of true, resulting in the bike resting too
far back on the stand.  The light carrier and lights were replaced when
I determined that the light contacts on the old carrier were
well-corroded.  Nice side benefit: the lights are noticably brighter
now. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Jun 16, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,471 </td>
<td> Adjusted valves and carb floats </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Re-adjusted the valves to make sure they were set up right.  If the
PO really did adjust the valves before I got the bike, it's got severely
receding valve seats -- both exhaust valves were tight.  I suspect that
he didn't adjust the valves, though, which means he lied about that
service, as well as the changed compression readings.  The reason I
suspect that is that the valve covers were still glued on with gasket
sealant, and he had mentioned having "sealed" the engine as part of
preparing it for sale.  The adjustment to the carb floats was to try and
fix them dribbling gas on my boots as I ride; the fix didn't work
though. </td>

<tr>
<td> Jun 23, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,515 </td>
<td> Replaced left float bowl again </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Turns out the first new float bowl had a loose overflow tube, so it
slowly seeped gasoline, dripped it onto the shifter pad, and thence onto
my boot.  Very smelly.  BMW warranty-replaced it, and the new one is
fine. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Jul 15, 2001 </td>
<td> 71,619 </td>
<td> Changed engine oil and filter </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Uneventful, unless you count two trips back to <a
href="http://www.ridewest.com">Ride West</a> to exchange incorrect parts
they had sold me.  I'm sure they were honest mistakes, but it's
frustrating to have a .5 hour oil change take a day and a half. </td>
