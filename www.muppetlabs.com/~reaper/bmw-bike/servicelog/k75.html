<h2> Service Log </h2>

<p> I'm keeping a log of all the service that I'm having done or doing
to this motorcycle, and I figured I could keep it online just as easily.
I have no idea if this will be helpful to anyone other than myself.

<td> Change spark plugs </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> In an attempt to figure out why the exhaust smells like gasoline.
Old plugs were carbon-fouled, but putting in new plugs had no effect.
It's going in to the dealer as soon as they get their exhaust gas
analyzer fixed. </td>

<tr>
<td> Feb 20, 2001 </td>
<td> 11,200 </td>
<td> New rear tire </td>
<td> Ian Johnston/Aurora Suzuki </td>
<td> I noticed an interesting "bump-bump" feeling while riding slowly --
pulled over to discover a self-tapping 3mm screw embedded deeply in my
rear tire.  Replaced it with another ME55 Metronic.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Mar 9, 2001 </td>
<td> 11,631 </td>
<td> New clutch, spline lube, level II service </td>
<td> Cascade BMW </td>
<td> I brought the bike in for a spline lube, and decided at the service
desk to have them do a level II service as well (replace all conceivable
fluids and adjust everything else).  I got a call two days later (they
were short-staffed) that the clutch only had 1/4 of its meat left
(hard driving by previous owner?) -- I figured I could afford it, so
better to do it now, than later when I might not be able to afford it.
Voila, new clutch.  (And $1050 less in pocketbook.) Mileage was noted as
11361 on the receipt, but was over 11,500 when I brought it in -- was
about 11,630ish when I picked it up. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Mar 9, 2001 </td>
<td> 11,640 </td>
<td> New front brake pads </td>
<td> Ian Johnston </td>
<td> Replaced stock Brembo pads with EBC's.  Hopefully this will improve
initial bite.  Fluid which came back into the reservoir was dark brown,
makes me wonder how well Cascade really changed the fluid. </td>
</tr>

<p> And, there was some service done by the dealership before I bought
the bike:
