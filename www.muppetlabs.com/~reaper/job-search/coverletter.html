<p>Dear Potential Employer,

<p>I am a Unix system and network administrator with four
years administration experience, and over 6 years general Unix
experience.  In my years, I have worked closely with a wide variety
of Unix-style operating systems, including SunOS, Solaris, IRIX,
BSDI (BSD/OS) and Linux.  I am familiar with the installation,
configuration and maintenance of a variety of essential services
and applications, including routing, DNS, NTP, NFS, HTTP, and
Windows 95/NT.

<p>I am seeking employment in the IS/IT department of a Seattle
area high-tech company. I want to participate in the growth and
advancement of a company which has a clear vision of its goals,
and the ability to reach those goals; where my contributions and
opinions will be valued.

<p>Please contact me if you are interested in learning more about
my qualifications, or would like to schedule an interview.
You can reach me either via telephone at (206) 633-4877 or email
at reaper@speakeasy.org.  I look forward to hearing from you.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Ian Johnston
