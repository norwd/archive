<h3> A note about the current version </h3>

<p> The current version of sctl is <b>not a finished product</b>.  It is
still in early alpha stages, with many expected features still missing,
and existing features only partially tested.  As such, you download this
program at your own risk.  I have tested each feature according to my
own uses, but an engineer makes a poor QA department.  See below for
information on upcoming features and submitting bug reports.

<p><hr>

<h3> Overview </h3>

<p> sctl is a program designed to control Bearcat model BC-895xlt
scanners.  It may control other scanners with PC-control (aka, "serial")
ports on them (no testing has been done yet).  It provides a command-line
interface, and is extremely small (it would be described as "fast" too,
but 9600 baud communication makes anything seem slow).  It should work
with any *nix system, and more targets will be tested as time goes on.
At present it's known to work with Debian 1.2 and Redhat 6.2, indicating
a good chance it'll work on any reasonably modern Linux system.

<p> Current capabilities include:

<p><ul>
<li> Read and set conventional (non-trunking) frequency memories
<li> Read and set talkgroup memories (type II only right now)
<li> Display current status of the radio
<li> Set several radio modes (scanning, single frequency, etc.)
<li> Read and set lockout and delay flags on individual channels
<li> Read and set speaker muting mode
<li> Built-in help system
</ul>

<p> Capabilities slated for future releases:

<p><ul>
<li> CTCSS control functions
<li> "Backup" and "restore" functions for cloning or whatnot
<li> Limit and ID (trunking) search
<li> Pre-defined searches (aircraft, police, ham, etc.)
<li> Post-compilation configuration via environment variables or a conf file
<li> A CGI front-end for web-controllable operation
<li> Testing with other PC-Controllable scanners
<li> Icom R-10 mode (and general capability for other scanners)
</ul>

<p> Features I <b>won't</b> be adding:

<p><ul>
<li> Binary releases
<li> RPM or Debian package releases
<li> Any variety of Java front-end
<li> Any variety of GUI front-end other than CGI (although if someone
else wants to write a gtk version, I'll be happy to host it here)
</ul>

<h3> Resources </h3>

<p> In writing this program, I primarily consulted the <a
href="http://dcu.muppetlabs.com/equipment/bc895xlt/bc895-programming/">Bearcat
programming manual (as re-interpreted by me)</a>.  I found that I was
unable to use the original programming manual, and had to re-translate
what they wrote into something that more closely resembled English.
Note that the original documents are available on each page.

<h3> Bug reports, feature requests, etc. </h3>

<p> I am open to bug reports and feature requests, but I ask your
consideration - this is a side-project for me, and I haven't always got
free time I can devote to it.  I want to make it a useful program for
people, though, so let me know what it should do.  In the same vein,
I'd like to know what's broken.

<p> If you want to help, send me an email and we can discuss what needs to
be done and what you're interested in doing.  I'm particularly interested
in enlisting the talents of someone who can do graphic design or tech
writing (aka, making a logo or writing the manpage).

<p> Please send any correspondence regarding sctl to me at <a
href="mailto:reaper@speakeasy.org">reaper@speakeasy.org</a>.

<h3> Copyright, GPL, etc. </h3>

<p> As is becoming more and more common, this software is placed under
the GPL. If you really want to thank me, send me an email or sing my
praises on freshmeat or something.  If you decide to incorporate this
code into a commercial product, I'd like to know about it.

<h3> Source Archives </h3>

<p> For old versions of the software, when I get to that point.
