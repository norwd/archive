<tr>
<td> 0.0.3 </td>
<td> This release differs from 0.0.2 only in how it deals with line-end
characters coming from the radio.  Where before there was a lot of code
dependent upon the \r I used to expect, that's all been removed, and the
one place it's necessary to depend on that, it's set up to use either \r
or \n, in case people have different situations with different radios.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 0.0.2 </td>
<td> In this release, the major modification is to (almost) fix the
problem with the line-end character from the scanner being \n instead of
\r.  Only, instead of actually fixing the problem, I just switched it
around, so that the code would only respond to \n.

<p> Also, several bugfixes and minor improvements, like better status
messages, and more intelligible conditions for mute.
</td>

<tr>
