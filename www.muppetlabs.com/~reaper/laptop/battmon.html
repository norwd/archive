# Simple Battery Monitor by Ian Johnston
#-----------------------------------------
# this program was designed and coded in about an hour, as a way to have
# a reasonable display of current battery status.  it's not very slick
# or even a great program, but it works, and it's very simple.  it is
# designed solely with Linux in mind, and your kernel must have the APM
# patches installed for it to work.  if your computer doesn't have an APM
# BIOS, this program won't help you at all.
#
# the display shows three pieces of information: whether the battery is
# charging or not, whether the AC line is connected, and the approximate
# charge in the battery.  as of this writing, the screen looked like
# this:
#
#	 ----------------------
#	 |Battery Status  * AC|
#	 |###########---------|
#	 |0        5        10|
#	 ----------------------
#
# the information displayed is: * = charging (becomes a '-' when the
# battery isn't charging), AC = power line connected (once again, 
# becomes '--' when disconnected).  the power bar should be fairly
# obvious, but it indicates percentage of battery charge, in 5% chunks.
#
# there are some variables below which are designed to be modified to 
# suit individual tastes.  at the moment, they are refresh delay and
# bar-character.  refresh delay is the number of seconds between when
# the program updates the information.  i have this sent to 10 at the
# moment, since that seems like a reasonable amount of time, given the
# circumstances.  the bar-character variable is just in case you don't
# like the "#" character, and want to use, say "*" instead.  it's a 
# matter of taste.
#
# i run this program as a window, using the following command:
# 
# rxvt -geometry 20x3+582+0 -T battery -n battery -e /home/reaper/bin/battery &
#
# obviously, you should replace the executable path (after the -e) with
# the path to wherever you stick the program.  the geometry should be 
# customized to suit your particular needs as well.  (20x3 is the right
# size for the window, though.)
#
# this is hardly the prettiest possible implementation, but it is a quick,
# simple hack, and it works for my needs.
