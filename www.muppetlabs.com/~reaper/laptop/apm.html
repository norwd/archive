<h1> APM usage </h1>
<p><hr><hr>

<p> I just recently compiled a new 1.2.13 kernel, and added the APM
patches to it.  The kernel patched effortlessly, and upon rebooting,
worked without a hitch.

<p> Unfortunately, I discovered a few minutes later that my PCMCIA modem
no longer worked properly: it was dropping characters in its responses.
I checked with <code>/var/adm/messages</code>, and discovered that
<code>/dev/cua1</code> was getting something called an "input overrun",
which I assume to mean there's some sort of interrupt-handling problem,
or a new conflict in how the port is prioritized.  

<p> I am using a Megahertz XJ1144, which is a 14.4k modem, incorporating
a slower 16450 UART.  The "input overruns" may have something to do with
this slower port, but I can't be certain. (Brief explanation: a 16450
buffers one character at a time, compared to a 16550, which buffers 16
characters at a time.  The practical upshot of this is that the 16550
can go a much longer time without any attention from the CPU.)

<p> The practical result of this is that I am primarily running the
APM-disabled kernel, since the modem is far more important to me.  I
have written a small and somewhat silly <a
href="battmon.html">program</a> to show a readout of the current status
of the battery, by reading <code>/proc/apm</code> and converting it into
a little bar graph.  Another program which does this is available,
which is X-dependent.  Although I run mine in X, it's text-based, and is
therefore suitable to a wider range of applications.  

<p> Sadly, most of the time, I can't use it due to the PCMCIA conflict.
I haven't had the time to figure out how to conquer this problem, so it
will simply have to exist.  I don't know if this will be an issue with
later models, which may have a more up-to-date APM BIOS.  (The APM
startup information says I have a Version 1.0 BIOS, whatever that may
mean.)
