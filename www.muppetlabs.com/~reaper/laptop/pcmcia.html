<h1> Installing the PCMCIA drivers: easy </h1>

<p> David Hinds' <a href="ftp://cb-iris.stanford.edu/pub/pcmcia/">pcmcia_cs</a>
package was relatively straightforward to install.  Once again, you
basically just follow the instructions given, and it seems to work.

<p> I didn't have any trouble with this package.  However, I've
only used it with my modem card (Megahertz XJ1144), which is a fairly
standardized device.  Check out the other laptop howto's and the 
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/PCMCIA-HOWTO.html">PCMCIA-HOWTO</a>
for information on installing other sorts of cards.

<p> The PCMCIA chipset in the 34/3600 is apparently the absolute industry
standard (i82365), and pcmcia_cs autodetects it with no trouble.  Here's what
gets logged about it:

<pre><code>
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 2.6.2
Intel PCIC probe: 
  Intel i82365sl rev 3 at 0x3e0, 1 socket
  irq mask (scanned) = 0x9eb8, status change on irq 15
sram_mtd: attr at 0x0, 0 kb, 250 ns
tty01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16450
</code></pre>

<p> I have finally gotten around to installing a new kernel, with APM.
You can find my commentary on that process <a href="apm.html>here</a>.
In a nutshell, it works, but not in conjunction with the PCMCIA drivers
and my modem.
