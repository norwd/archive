<p> These pages are an extremely brief description of my experience 
installing Linux (specifically Slackware 2.1.0) on my Toshiba T-3400.
They are <em>probably</em> applicable to the T-3600CT, which is basically
the same computer, with an upgraded processor and more standard RAM.

<p> The images you encounter along the way are thumbnail images of
larger JPEGs, and you simply need click on any thumbnail to see the
full-size image.  The full-size JPEGs range from 30k to 60k in size.
If you are unhappy with the quality of the pictures, let me know what's
wrong, and I'll try to fix them.

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> I assume throughout these documents that the
reader is familiar with Linux/Unix in general, and is taking on the
laptop installation as a new challenge, not as a first Linux install.  
If this is not the case for
you, these pages might not be helpful enough.
