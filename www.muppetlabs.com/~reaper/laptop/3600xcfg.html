<p> Note, this XF86Config has been severly trimmed down to reduce disk

<p>Other notes, this is only for the internal LCD, and does not include any
external monitor info, although this depends largely on your monitor...

<p>The size was trimmed down for three reasons:

<ol>

   <p><li> Speed in which it's parsed, which reduces X Windows startup time
(whether this works, I'm not sure - I haven't benchmarked it).

   <p><li> Reduce disk space required, no matter how minimal (I'm reducing just
about everything I can, including README's, FAQ's, basically *anything* that
does not effect *full* usability of the system (i.e. all utilities, etc.)

   <p><li> Lastly, after modifying *zillions* (so it seems) of XFConfig files, I
don't need all the comments and such - I'd rather just see the section I
need, and get right to it.
