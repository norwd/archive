<h1> Information on the 3400 and 3600 </h1>

<p> The Toshiba T-3400 and T-3400CT are basically the same computer,
with different screens.  The 3400 is monochrome, and the 3400CT is
active-matrix color.  The 3400CT is also slightly larger, heavier and
has a shorter battery life than the monochrome version, but not by much.

<p> The Toshiba T-3600CT is apparently just a 3400CT with a better CPU, 
RAM and harddrive.  The color screen on the 3600CT is slightly larger than
that of the 3400CT.  It didn't come in a monochrome version.

<p> The T-3400[CT] has these basic specs:
<ul>
	<li> 486 SL-enhanced 33MHz processor (no math co-processor)
	<li> 640x480 dual scan monochrome or active-matrix color display
	<li> 64 grey levels or 256 colors
	<li> 4MB standard RAM, exp. to 20 MB
	<li> 120 MB IDE harddrive, with 250 MB option for CT model
	<li> External 1.44 MB Floppy (included)
	<li> AccuPoint mouse (pointing stick) with PS/2 interface
	<li> WD90C24A video chipset
	<li> 1 serial, 1 parallel port external
	<li> 1 PCMCIA Type II slot (5 mm) 
	<li> 1 72-pin expansion slot, for a port replicator or the included
VGA adaptor
	<li> Lithium-Ion battery with about 4 hours life, 3 hours
recharge time (off)
</ul>

<p> And, the T-3600CT has these basic specs:
<ul>
	<li> 486 DX/2 50 MHz processor
	<li> 640x480 active-matrix color display
	<li> 256 colors
	<li> 8MB standard RAM, exp. to 24 MB
	<li> 250 MB standard harddrive (although later models reportedly
came with 500 MB standard)<a href="3600src.html">*</a>
	<li> External 1.44 MB Floppy (included)
	<li> AccuPoint mouse (pointing stick) with PS/2 interface
	<li> WD90C24A2 video chipset
	<li> 1 serial, 1 parallel port external
	<li> 1 PCMCIA Type II slot (5 mm) 
	<li> 1 72-pin expansion slot, for a port replicator or the included
VGA adaptor
	<li> Lithium-Ion battery with about 4 hours life, 3 hours
recharge time (off)
</ul>

<p> I have had almost no trouble with Linux's interaction with my 3400.
The only thing which seems a bit odd is that every once in a while,
it'll drop all keystrokes for about 2 seconds.  This isn't really a
problem as much as an quirk.  I don't recall the problem
exisiting with Windows/DOS, but then, it only ran Windows for about a
week before I had time to purge the infection and install Linux.

<p> My current best theory on why this happens is that it has something
to do with the hard drive parking its heads.  I've noticed that there is
a little thunking sound when the keystrokes are being ignored, which I
assume is the hard drive parking after a specified period of inactivity.
I have no idea why this should effect anything, but it seems to.

<p> <b>Update:</b> It turns out that there was a bug in the keyboard
BIOS, which is what caused the dropped keystrokes.  Replacing the
motherboard is the recommended cure for this, but I never could convince
my warranty shop to do it (the just reflashed the BIOS, which had no
effect) -- so now that my T-3400 is out of warranty, I just live with
the problem.
