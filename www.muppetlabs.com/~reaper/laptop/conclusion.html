<h1> Conclusion: no sweat </h1>
<p><hr><hr>

<p> As seems to be the case with most modern laptops, the T-3400 is
standard enough that Linux causes no real trouble.  My installation of
Slackware 2.1.0 was completely error free, after discounting the
flakey memory module.

<p> PCMCIA support was painless to install, and should cause no
problems.  Beware if you want to use APM and PCMCIA at the same time,
you may run into trouble.

<p> XFree86 should also pose no trouble, as long as you are
installing version 3.1.2 or later.  This version is the first to
include support for the WD90C24[A|A2] chipset.  Keeping in mind the
proviso about using 'Simultaneous' mode for the video hardware,
everything should be fine.  Note again that I don't have experience on
the color machines.  Your mileage (as they say) may vary.

<p> Note my <a href="disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a>, since I'm only
human, and don't know the details of your hardware...
