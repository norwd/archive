<h1> Installing XFree86 3.1.2 </h1>
<p><hr><hr>

<p> My preferred installation method was to actually go and grab the 
various packages directly from a sunsite mirror, rather than use the
Slackware disk sets.  This was due to the extremely small nature of my
HD...

<p> The installation, once I sorted out where things were meant to be
unpacked, was fairly straightforward.  Note that with version 3.1.2 of
XF86, the WD90C24 chipset is directly supported.  There is another
document available, the <a
href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/X-Notebook">X-Notebook
mini HOWTO</a>, which details the general installation of X on a
laptop computer, without going into great specifics on individual
computers.  This is an excellent reference, and I found it extremely
useful when working on installing X.

<p> I've actually installed the packages which are marked (R)equired,
plus an old version of fvwm and rxvt.  I got these from the 
<a 
href="ftp://ftp.warwick.ac.uk/pub/linux/sunsite.unc-mirror/X11/tinyX/">TinyX</a>
distribution, which is one to check out, if you only want monochrome,
and don't mind having XFree86 2.0.  I tried briefly to get the TinyX
SVGA server to work, but eventually gave up in favor of getting the
current server. (See the problem I mention below.)

<p> When you install X (if you choose to do the configuration yourself
rather than using my XF86Config),
these are the vital, important points to remember:
<p><ul>
	<li> Your computer has a WD90C24 chipset.  The 3400 has the A
model (WD90C24A), and the 3600 has the A2 model (WD90C24A2), although
this currently makes no difference as far as the user is concerned.
	<li> Your LCD screen should be treated as a standard 640x480
monitor (ie, pick the most constrained options for monitor config, or use
the specs for the external monitor you'll be using).
	<li> On monochrome machines, you have 512k of 
available VRAM when using the internal screen, due to the way the screen 
is drawn. (You really have
1024, but if you try to assert that, you'll get doubled images.)  There
is still 1024k available when driving an external monitor.  Use a
virtual desktop of 800x600 when using the LCD.
	<li> Active-matrix machines are not apparently subject to this
memory limitation (again due to the way the screen is drawn in hardware). 
If you have a color machine, you should be able to 
use 1024k and a 1024x768 virtual desktop with no trouble.
	<li> The AccuPoint mouse is a PS/2 mouse, and should be treated
as such.  Note that this means running selection/gpm will interfere with
X starting, and you'll probably have to kill it before X will start
properly (there may be a workaround available in the current
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Busmouse">Busmouse-HOWTO</a>,
but my copy -- which appears to date from around kernel 1.0 -- doesn't 
have one).  
If <kbd>startx</kbd> dies with the "Device or Resource Busy" 
message, this is what's happening.
</ul>

<h2> Problem: video mode </h2>

<p> The only brief problem I encountered was that for some reason, the
desktop was tiled over itself in a random (but reproducible) pattern.
It took me most of an evening to discover that, at least on the 3400
monochrome version, the video hardware must be set to 'Simultaneous'
display mode or it won't work properly.  On the 3400 monochrome, this is
accomplished by entering the BIOS setup menu (hold down the [ESC] key
while the system is rebooting; press [F1] at the prompt), and
selecting 'Simultaneous' instead of 'Internal/External' mode in the
'Display' box.  On the color versions, it's not necessary to use the
BIOS menu.

<p> On the color machines (eg. 3400CT and 3600CT), the <code>
[Fn] + [F5]</code> hotkey combination switches between 
internal/simultaneous/external display modes, and on the monochrome
(3400), it only selects internal/external.  On the 3600, this setting 
appears to make no difference to XFree86's operation <a 
href="3600src.html">*</a>.  This 
suggests that color 3400's will also have no problem with the different 
settings either.

<h2> Problem: video timings </h2>

<p> Michael Holve reports that if the video mode timings (in the modeline
definitions) on his 3600CT are even slightly wrong, the screen will go 
all jittery.
This should not be a problem if you just use the provided mode timings:

<pre>
Modeline "640x480"     25.175 640  664  760  800   480  491  493  525
</pre>

This trouble also appears to be isolated to the active-matrix machines
(or at least, I've never had trouble with it on the monochrome 3400).

<p> If I could give you only one piece of advice when dealing with the
configuration of XFree86, it would be: be careful and patient.  Read
the documentation, and try to understand what it says <em>before</em>
messing around with the actual configuration files.  It'll save you a
great deal of time and effort.

<p> Here's my <a href="3400xcfg.html">XF86Config file</a>, for your 
perusal.  Note that
I don't have an external monitor for testing, and this config file
isn't likely to work with one (except at 640x480).  If you want to use
an external monitor it is <em>very</em> important that you find the
ratings for your monitor, and follow the instructions given in the
X-Notebook mini HOWTO.  You could very easily maim or destroy your
monitor if you're not careful.

<p> This config file will most likely work right out of the box on any
of the models being covered in this mini HOWTO, but I make no
guarantees.  Make sure you check it through and change any
site-dependent stuff I've left in.  Also, if you have the time, it's
well worth trying out the configuration process, if only for the
experience.

<p> Michael Holve has <a href="3600src.html">donated</a> 
<a href="3600xcfg.html">his XF86Config</a> as well,
although once again, no guarantees are made as to how well it will work
for your particular situation.
