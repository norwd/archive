<h1> The installation process: painless </h1>
<p><hr><hr>

<p> I chose to install Slackware 2.1.0, which was the current release at
the time.  The installation process should be clearly outlined in the
package you are using.  In my particular case, I installed from
floppies, since I had no access to a CD-ROM.

<p> Due to the relatively small harddrive in this machine (mine came
with a 120 MB drive), I chose not to install things like XFree86,
TeX, or some of the other things which seemed 'frivolous' at the time.
I did eventually install XFree86, as I mention later.

<p> The installation went well, and if you follow the instructions
provided with Slackware (or whichever distribution you are using), you 
should be fine.  Keep in mind that it's
probably wise (from a data-security standpoint) to make at least two
data partitions on your harddrive - this saved me at one point from having
to completely reinstall.  I've got two data and one swap partition: 10
MB swap, 30 MB '/' and 80 MB '/usr'.  As of this moment, this is what df
says about my harddrive:

<p><pre><code>
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hda1              29856   12734    15581     45%   /
/dev/hda2              79310   67730     7484     90%   /usr
</pre></code>

<p> And this is how I partitioned the disk: 

<p><pre><code>
Disk /dev/hda: 8 heads, 38 sectors, 812 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 304 * 512 bytes

   Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *       1       1     203   30837   83  Linux native
/dev/hda2         204     204     742   81928   83  Linux native
/dev/hda3         743     743     812   10640   82  Linux swap
</pre></code>

<p> I did run into <a href="problems.html">trouble</a>, which was
extremely hard to track down.  I eventually found it in the memory
module which was expanding my system to 8 MB of RAM.  Installation of a
new module seems to have fixed the problem.  Nothing has gone wrong yet.

<p> Michael Holve reported that he has expanded his 3600 to 16 MB of 
RAM with no
trouble, using an original Toshiba upgrade card (possibly
Kensington-made).  I also installed a Toshiba upgrade,
and the individual chips were marked with 'Toshiba' (as opposed to 'NEC'
like my previous card).

<p> In general, there should be few problems, as the computer seems to
be fairly standard, as far as Linux is concerned.

<p> <strong>Note on the T-3600:</strong>  I haven't actually used one of
these machines.  My comments regarding the 3600 are based almost entirely on
the 
<a href="http://www.toshiba.com/tais/csd/support/products/tig/pc/t3600.htm">specifications 
provided by Toshiba</a>, and Mr. Holve's comments.  However, they look 
remarkably similar, both
superficially, and in terms of specifications.  The major (only)
differences between the two models seem to be:
<p><ul>
	<li> Different CPU (3400: 486sl33, 3600: 486dx2/50)
	<li> Slightly different video chipset (3400: WD90C24<b>A</b>, 3600:
WD90C24<b>A2</b>)
	<li> The 3600 comes with 8 MB standard RAM, the 3400 with 4
(note that this means the 3600 is expandable to 24 MB and the 3400 to
20 MB)
	<li> The 3600 comes with 250 MB standard HD, the 3400 with 120
	<li> The 3600 has no monochrome option
</ul>

<p> They should react in exactly the same way, other than the
differences outlined above. (Most notably, the 3600 is a more generally
capable machine.)
