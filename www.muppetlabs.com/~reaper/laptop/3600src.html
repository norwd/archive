<p> This information was made available through the help of 
<a href="mailto:holve@fammed.som.sunysb.edu">Michael Holve</a>.
His
experience with the 3600CT has been graciously offered for my use in
these pages.

<p> I am indebted to him
for his contribution to these pages, in the
form of information and configs for the 3600CT.  His help has been
invaluable, and I've been able to significantly increase my information
on the 3600 model because of it.  Thanks, Michael!
