<h1> Problems encountered: expanded memory </h1>
<p><hr><hr>

<p> The main problem I ran into was a simple one to fix, but took quite
a while to track down.

<p> The memory module, expanding my system from 4 MB (on the
motherboard) to 8 MB was causing trouble.  I had been worried that the
on-board interface to the memory was faulty, or poorly designed, but
after installing the new module (an official Toshiba upgrade of 4 MB),
there seems to be no trouble.  Extensive testing into the effectiveness
of the upgrade has not yet been completed.

<p> I noticed that the howto relating to the T-4500 also mentioned a
problem like this, although the problem in that case was fixed when
booting from the harddrive.

<p> The actual problems I ran into seemed to center around the swap
partition.  This (naturally enough) led me astray, into thinking that
my harddrive was malfunctioning.  However, many consecutive tests
proved that to be wrong.

<p> I would typically get kernel panics, and unexplainable errors,
such as the display freezing, etc.  One of the most common errors was
<dl><dt>
<code> swap_free: swap map entry bad (in 00008000) </code> 
</dt></dl>
or something like that.  Typically, I would get between 3 and 15 of 
those errors upon
shutdown, after doing just about <em>anything</em>.  If I tried
anything really big, like compiling the kernel, I would get
segmentation violations and other fun things (specifically, GCC would
return errors 4 and 11, which should <strong>never</strong> happen).
Trying to run PGP on a large document (say, the XFree HOWTO) would
also produce errors.  It seemed to be that any program large
enough to have to do I/O to the additional memory would cause
problems.

<p> If you're experiencing these errors, and have an add-on memory
module: try taking it out.  I realize it's painful to run in 4 MB, but
give it a try and see if the errors clear up.  If they do, you may have
defective memory like I did.
