<h1> Other sources of information for the Portege models </h1>
<p><hr><hr>

<p> I've gathered together all the other sources of information you might
find useful, and which deal with Linux, the Portege models, or both.

<p> If you know of something I've forgotten or missed, please 
<a href="mailto:reaper@muppetlabs.com">mail me</a> and I'll put it up
here where everyone can find it.

<h2> General Sources </h2>
<dl>

<p><dt> <a href="http://www.infomagic.com/linux/ldp/">The Linux Documentation
Project</a>

	<dd> This is the site of almost all organized documentation work in
the Linux community.  If you have a question, check here first.  Some
of the other information on this page is simply gleaned from the LDP.

<p><dt> <a href="http://www.linux.org/">The Linux Homepage</a>

	<dd> This is the definitive site on Linux.  You'll be able to
find most information about Linux by cruising around this site.

<p><dt> <a href="http://www.toshiba.com/tais/csd/support/">The Toshiba 
Product Support Page</a>

	<dd> Here you will find all the information Toshiba feels like
providing you.  This is the product support page, which will direct you
to help on many of their computer products.  If you're not in the States,
you might want to turn off image auto-loading, as this one's pretty big.

<p><dt> <a href="http://fuz.ttk.com/~dchow/T3400CT/">David Chow's
Modification page</a>

	<dd> David Chow has gone in for some hard-core modification of his
T-3400.  Check this page out for information on upgrading your processor
(to DX4-100 in his case!) and other aspects of the T-3400.

<h2> Specific HOWTO's </h2>
<dl>

<p><dt> 
<a href="http://www.infomagic.com/linux/ldp/HOWTO/Busmouse-HOWTO.html">The
Busmouse Howto</a>

	<dd> This document provides information about using busmice
(which is the sort of mouse used almost universally in laptops),
including the PS/2 mouse interface, which isn't <em>technically</em> a
busmouse, but is covered.

<p><dt>
<a href="http://www.infomagic.com/linux/ldp/HOWTO/PCMCIA-HOWTO.html">The
PCMCIA Howto</a>

	<dd> All aspects of PCMCIA usage, which will be of interest if
you plan on using the PCMCIA slot(s) in your Portege.

<p><dt> <a
href="http://www.infomagic.com/linux/ldp/HOWTO/mini/X-Notebook">The
X-Notebook Howto</a>

	<dd> The definitive document on using XFree86 on your laptop.
There's no specifically Toshiba-oriented information, but the chipset
used in the Portege line is very common, and is the main focus of this
HOWTO.

<h2> Mailing Lists and such </h2>
<dl>

<p><dt> <a href="mailto:majordomo@cs.unc.edu">The 
Portege Mailing List</a>

	<dd> This list (according 
to <a href="mailto:faith@cs.unc.edu">Rik Faith</a>), covers all
aspects of the Toshiba Portege models, and is <strong>not Linux
specific</strong>.  It will be a good source for machine-related
questions, but don't pester them with questions specific to Linux.
The normal topic is apparently Win95 and Windows for Workgroups.

	<p> To subscribe to the list, <b>send "subscribe 
portege"</b> to the link above (majordomo@cs.unc.edu).

	<p> There is also a 
<a href="ftp://cs.unc.edu/pub/users/faith/portege-faq-950811.gz">FAQ</a> 
available regarding this list, which does have a Linux section.

<p><dt><a href="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">The Linux-Laptop
mailing list</a>

	<dd> This list (according to the 
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/">Linux
Laptop Homepage</a>) is as yet fairly low-traffic, but would be a good
place to discuss issues of running linux on a laptop, in general terms.

	<p> To subscribe, send:
