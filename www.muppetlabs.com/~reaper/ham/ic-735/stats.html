<h2> IC-735 Description </h2> 

<p> The IC-735 is a mid-range amateur HF tranceiver, covering all HF ham
bands from 160m to 10m, including WARC.  It is capable of putting out
100 watts of SSB, FM, and CW, and 40 watts of AM.  Output power is
continually variable from 10-100 watts (5-40 W AM).  The receiver
receives continuously from 0.1 MHz to 29.9999 MHz.

<p> The front panel controls are generally well laid-out, and include
more controls than are typically available on this price-class of
tranceiver.  The analog meter can display incoming signal S level, RF
power output, SWR and ALC.  

<p> The receiver includes RIT, single pass-band tuning, and a "more than
30 dB" notch filter.  The squelch control is multi-mode, and works in
all modes.  Various preamp and attenuator settings allow a range from
-20 dB to +10 dB preamplification of incoming signals.

<p> The transmitter includes VOX and semi- and full-break in QSK keying
in CW.  It includes a SWR protection circuit which will lower output
power as SWR increases, to protect output transistors.

<p> The radio is entirely solid-state, with a digital display.  The
display shows digits down to the 100 Hz digit, but the radio tunes in
10 Hz steps.  There are 12 memories, with memory slots 11 and 12
doubling as scan-edge memories.

<p> On the back panel, ports are available for auxilliary I/O (such as
a multi-mode TNC), power amp, and transverter, as well as the standard
SO-239.  There is also provision for a separate receive-only antenna.
And, to top it all off, there is an RS-232C control port (requires TTL
- RS-232 level converter), which can control virtually all features of
the radio.
