<h2> Images of the Icom IC-735 </h2>

<p> These pictures were taken with an Apple QuickTake 200 digital
camera, and cropped and sized with xv.  This radio is one that I bought
from an estate sale, sticky with smoker's tar and with half
the controls melted.  I replaced several of the control buttons and
knobs, cleaned off the tar, and had the radio professionally aligned at
Malcom Technical Service.  It's now working quite well for me, mostly on
10m at the moment.  (You just have to ignore that the VFO knob is no
longer round, due to melting a bit...)

<p> Newly available, we have the <a href="stats.html">stats and
description</a> of the IC-735.
