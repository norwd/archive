<h2> The Yaesu FT-690R </h2>

<p> This page is a brief pictoral description of the FT-690R Mark I
model, about which I was unable to find anything on the web.  I hope
this helps anyone interested in the older Mark I models of this radio.
Click on the thumbnails to bring up a full sized image.

<p> I have written up a short <a href="desc.html">description of the
FT-690R Mk I</a>, covering operation of the radio, and what some of the
features are.  There are also <a href="specs.html">specifications</a> 
from the manual available.

<ul>

<li><p><a href="images/ft-690.jpg"><img src="images/ft-690-sm.jpg"
alt="[FT-690 front view w/ amp]" align="center"></a>
<p>This is the front panel view, including amp and microphone.  This amp
has a "Spectrum Communications" label on top of it, but I've never found
reference to the brand name anywhere else on the web.

<li><p><a href="images/690front.jpg"><img src="images/690front-sm.jpg"
alt="[FT-690 front view]" align="center"></a>
<p>This is the front panel view.  You can easily see the Vol/Sql knob, the
Mode knob (note that AM is included there), and the Memory knob.  The
buttons you may not be able to read are, from upper left to lower right,
Dial/S; Call; MR/Pri; M; F; Clar; Step; VFO.  The two LEDs are Busy and
On Air.

<li><p><a href="images/690back.jpg"><img src="images/690back-sm.jpg"
alt="[FT-690 rear view]" align="center"></a>
<p>Here is the back panel.  Pretty basic.  There are connections for Key,
External Power, Charge, and Antenna.  The switches are Lamp/Off/Batt,
Noise Blanker, and Power Out.  The &quot;switch&quot; in the middle is
the latch for the bottom panel.

<li><p><a href="images/690batt2.jpg"><img src="images/690batt2-sm.jpg"
alt="[FT-690 battery compartment]" align="center"></a>
<p>The battery compartment is opened by moving the latch on the rear panel.
Nothing more complex is involved, which makes it easy to swap batteries
in the field, or change settings.  Inside this bottom compartment,
you'll find the batteries, a switch for the Tone Squelch unit (and I
just found out that the FTS-7A tone board will work in the older model),
a switch to set the scan stop condition (Busy, Clear and Manual), and a
backup switch, which will use the lithium battery to maintain memories.

<li><p><a href="images/690hand.jpg"><img src="images/690hand-sm.jpg"
alt="[FT-690 with hand for size comparison]" align="center"></a>
<p>To provide some sense of scale, here's a shot of the radio with my hand.
It's not very big.

<hr>

<li><p><a href="images/690andkeys.jpg"><img src="images/690andkeys-sm.jpg"
alt="[FT-690 with keys for size comparison]" align="center"></a>
<p>For yet more scale, here is the radio with keys on top.

<li><p><a href="images/690ant.jpg"><img src="images/690ant-sm.jpg"
alt="[FT-690 with antenna extended]" align="center"></a>
<p>This radio, unlike the FT-690R Mk II, includes a built-in whip antenna.
Since it's a six meter radio, the antenna is quite long!  I think the
whole thing is about 5 feet tall, which precludes me from using it on
a table at home -- my ceilings are too short.
