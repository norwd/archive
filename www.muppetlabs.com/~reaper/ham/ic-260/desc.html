	<p>This is a very simple all-mode radio, incorporating two VFOs 
(which can be used for split operation), and three memories.  It is
capable of scanning either the entire frequency range (143.8 - 148.2
MHz in American market models) or the memory channels.  The VFOs can be
ganged together for repeater work.
	<p>The radio has a Noise Blanker circuit, which I've had no use for
(but may reduce some ignition-related noise), and an AGC fast/slow control.  
There is also an RIT control, which is useful for SSB and CW operation.
	<p>CW may be used either with a straight key or with a keyer --
there is no keyer built in.  The internal speaker fires downward, in
classic mobile style.  The mobile bracket resembled a rigid strap which
clamps around the radio to provide mounting holes.
	<p>The manual is complete and informative.  If you're already
familiar with all-mode operation, such as on an HF rig, you aren't
likely to find many surprises here.  The manual does come with both a
schematic diagram and a color diagram of parts layout on the board, but
these sheets are loose and folded inbetween pages.  None of the
materials I have are dated, but I believe the radio was produced in the
early '80s.
	<p>I have been pleased with the performance of this radio, given
its age and relative simplicity.  It puts out (I've been told) clear
strong audio, and the receiver seems adequate.  I have no basis for
comparison, or I might be able to rate the receiver more accurately.
