<h2> The Icom IC-260A </h2>

<p> This page is a brief pictoral description of the IC-260A, 
about which I was unable to find anything on the web.  I hope
this helps anyone interested in this radio.
Click on the thumbnails to bring up a full sized image.

<p> I have written up a short <a href="desc.html">description of the
IC-260A</a>, covering specifications of the radio, and what some of the
features are.
