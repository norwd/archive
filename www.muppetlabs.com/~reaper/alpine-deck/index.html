<h2> Alpine MDM-7741 Car MD deck review </h2>

<p><i> July 16, 2001 </i>

page for this deck</a>

<h3> Summary </h3>

<p> <b>This is a nice basic deck, with good MD playback, a fairly intuitive
interface and a subdued appearance.  It does pretty well as a MD player,
and pretty well as a broadcast receiver.  It's not really fantastic at
anything.</b>

<p> <b>Pros:</b>
<ul>
<li> Simple-to-use interface
<li> Excellent sound quality
<li> Subdued appearance
<li> MD playback
<li> Good build quality
</ul>

<p> <b>Cons:</b>
<ul>
<li> MD mechanism slow to engage (3-5 seconds)
<li> Some controls non-intuitive
<li> Removable faceplate is mediocre theft-prevention (no power-on code,
for instance)
<li> Some buttons are too small (notably "title" and "scroll")
</ul>
<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p> I wanted to replace the Concord No-Name Special CD deck that came in
my '92 Honda Civic.  It had been dropped according to the previous owner
(either while removed or during installation), so the display had no
backlight, making it impossible to see, and the CD player mechanism
could only cope with about 25% of the CDs I tried to play.

<p> I had looked on numerous occasions to replace it with either a new
CD deck or a new MD deck, since I have a variety of MD gear.  CD decks
didn't seem worth the bother, and MD decks all seemed too expensive, but
after taking a long trip sans music or even any broadcast stations,
I couldn't take it any more.  I went down to Car Toys to see what they
had.

<p> Car Toys, in early July 2001, had two MD decks on their walls: a
Sony X-Plod model, and the Alpine in question.  Their price on the
Alpine was shockingly good, at $349 installed.  I did some searching
around the web, and didn't find anyone selling the deck for less than
$350, so I decided to go with the Car Toys deal.

<h3> The Deck </h3>

<p> The deck itself is fairly basic.  It has 18 radio memory presets: 12
FM and 6 AM.  It's got a 40Wx4 amplifier.  Removable faceplate.  Single
MD capacity, with the ability to control a CD changer.  It doesn't look
very fancy.  In short, it was a good stylistic and budget match for me.

<p> The audio it produces is clearer and fuller than the Concord (big
surprise there).  The MD playback is as flawless as a car deck can
reasonably get, although the amount of time necessary to get the disc
spinning seems to be longer than I would expect.  40 watts isn't very
much in the car audio world, but it seems to put out as much undistorted
sound as I ever require.

<p> The receiver seems to work very well.  I haven't had any chance to
really test it with a distant station, but it receives local FM stations
with aplomb.  The memory system offers something called Direct Access
Programming, which seems to allow you to program either AM or FM
stations to different buttons in the same "band" -- useful if you have a
small handful of stations of different bands that you like to listen to.

<h3> Using It </h3>

<p> The user interface to this deck is usually intuitive, and can be
used without looking, but there are some areas that could have been
better designed.  Fortunately, those areas are confined to stuff you
don't need to be doing while driving -- setting memories, adjusting the
bass frequency, setting the clock, etc.

<p> The volume control is a pushbutton type.  I find the lowest volume
settings to be a bit too discrete, with a large gap between "loud enough
to hear well" and "loud enough to converse over."  The display shows
both numerically and with a bargraph what the current volume is, when
you press a volume button.  There is a mode button in between the two
volume buttons, which fortunately always starts at "bass" if you need to
adjust settings frequently while driving.  (It controls bass, treble,
balance, fader, and volume, going from memory.)

<p> The station selection buttons for the radio are fairly small, but I
still don't seem to have a problem hitting just one with my medium-large
fingers (I'm 6' 1" tall and weigh 215 pounds).  Unfortunately, they're
dual-purpose, selecting some playmode settings for the MD (random play
and repeat, notably), and the secondary function is not lit up by the
backlight.

<p> The buttons which change the display from time, to track, to track
name, etc. are dangerously close to the "disc eject" button, and I've
accidentally ejected the disc more than once while trying to find the
clock display.

<p> The deck does have some nice features, in the button area.  There's
a play/pause switch, so you can pause a disc without having to turn the
deck off (thus avoiding that long startup time).  There are separate
"source" and "band" buttons, so that switching between MD and radio
doesn't affect which band the radio's on.  The "forward track" and
"backward track" buttons will skip to track boundaries or fast-wind
through the track if held.  The power button doubles as a mute button
if you press it quickly.

<p> Speaking of quickly, some of the buttons require you to hold them
down to access a secondary function -- the period you have to hold them
seems prohibitively long to me, at about 3 seconds.  This includes the
power button to shut the radio off (but turning it on is instantaneous).
I suspect most people will rarely turn off the radio, either removing
the faceplate or switching to a stopped MD instead.

<h3> Conclusion </h3>

<p> For an overall installed price of $380 plus change, I'm fairly
pleased.  It does what I want it to do -- plays minidiscs, receives
broadcast audio, doesn't have "pretty" features to get in my way -- very
well, and is fairly easy to use.

<p> I've discovered that it's worthwhile not turning on the radio before
starting the car if a disc is playing.  With that 3 second pause before
it starts playing the disc again, it can get pretty annoying.  The deck
seems to need that time to spin the disc up every time you switch away
from the MD source, whether it be by powering down, switching to the
radio, or presumably switching to the CD changer.

<p> I find I don't really like having a removable face plate, because
I'm now paranoid about leaving it in the car, where with the old stereo,
I couldn't have paid a thief to take it.  It would have been nice if
Alpine had supplied one of the swanky fold-in faceplates with a power-on
code like Kenwood is doing with some of their decks.

<p> I highly recommend this deck to anyone who's interested in having a
good work-horse MD receiver in their car.  If you're interested in
having the coolest-looking stereo on your block, look elsewhere.  (Sony
has some crazed-looking stereos that might suit you better.)

<p> The Alpine name is highly regarded in car stereos, and their quality
appears to be reflected in this unit.  The build quality seems high,
and I don't have any fear the radio will break any time soon (but I'll
post it here if it does).
