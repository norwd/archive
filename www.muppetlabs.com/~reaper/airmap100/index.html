<p> I just received my new <a href =
"http://www.lowrance.com/Aviation/Products/am_100.asp">Airmap 100</a>,
and will be posting a review here in the next few weeks.

<p> Quick first impressions, though:

<p><ul>
<li> Nicely packaged
<li> Comes with all the accessories you'd likely need
<li> The data cable I got was broken, and a quick, painless phone call
to the tech support line yielded a competent tech who said a new cable
is in the mail asap
<li> Interface is easy enough that you don't need the manual for much
</ul>
