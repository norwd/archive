 <blockquote>
  Hyperdimensional Gateways are doorways into adjacent universes.
  Although our universe is very large in the three dimensions we see, it
  is actually very thin in the fourth spatial dimension.  Some estimates
  put this thickness at only 10<sup>-33</sup> cm!

 <blockquote>
  Every time someone makes a choice a new universe is created, one for
  each possible outcome.  The extra universe is stuck in right next to
  the one the decision is made in.  Billions of times per second a new
  universe is created that's <em>almost</em> like the one you're in.
  <p>
  In fact, when you choose to step through a hyperdimensional gateway,
  a new universe is created:  there has to be a universe for the You that
  didn't choose to step through and one for the You who did.  That's why
  you'll never meet yourself in the other universe.  (And that's why
  you can never come back the way you came...)
  <p>
  Q:  Why do I see the same person both <em>through</em> and <em>around</em> the gateway?
  <p>
  A:  Universe creation is complicated.  While the new universe is coming
  into being, you are being split, too.  For just a moment you'll see
  two universes at once.  Once the person has finished going through,
  then the split is complete and the illusion will pass.
