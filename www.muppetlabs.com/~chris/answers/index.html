 <h1>The Answers</h1>
 <p>
 Occasionally I'll get a quiz mailed to me.  I'm supposed to fill it
 out and mail it to someone else, kind of like a chain letter.  Well,
 actually, it <em>is</em> a chain letter.  So, I delete it.  Anyone who
 knows me knows how I feel about chain email, and anyone who doesn't
 know how I feel about chain email doesn't know me.
 <p>
 Usually, that means if you don't know me, you'll get a return note
 telling you <em>exactly</em> what I think.  Happily, most of you survive
 the experience, and many exhibit "learning behavior" and stop sending
 me chain mail.
 <p>
 My preference is for things like this do be done on the World Wide
 Web, if at all.  In that vein, I'll start collecting the questions
 asked of me here, and whenever you have the urge to Know All About Me
 (hah!) it'll all be here.
 <p>
 This will necessarily have no particular order.  I don't choose the 
 questions, I just answer them.  Maybe...
