Why GMRS when I'm already an amateur?  A recent FCC finding noted that 
GMRS and Family Radio Service (FRS) stations were allowed to communicate
with each other where each service's frequencies overlapped (i.e. the
GMRS interstitial frequencies and FRS channels 1-7).
<p>
As a result of this ruling, there have been emergency operations using
GMRS and FRS equipment in the field.  I <em>could</em> be a snob and
refuse to participate in such operations, or I could get with the spirit
and help out in an emergency.  And so that I don't get stuck operating 
a cheesy little FRS radio, I obtained a GMRS license.
<p>
When I monitor at all, I'll listen on 462.625 simplex, CTCSS tone 131.8 Hz
