 <h1>Original Dungeons and Dragons</h1>

 <img src="images/DD00-Box.jpg" width=200 align=right>
 Before <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> was a multi-godzillion dollar industry
 controlled by a huge corporation, the game was a series of three tiny
 booklets packaged in a box with reference sheets and polyhedral dice
 for ten bucks.  Despite the fact that these rules were originally intended
 to supplement the rules of <i>Chainmail</i>&mdash;a system for running
 combat warfare with miniature armies&mdash;these three books, with some
 dice, pencils, and graph paper, were all you needed to play the game.
 (To contrast, I just purchased the 4th Edition Core Rules, also three
 volumes, for $104.95.  Plus tax.)
 <p>
 <i>D&D</i> quickly expanded into several useful supplemental booklets
 before being entirely rewritten into the original <i>Advanced Dungeons
 and Dragons</i> rules that all subsequent versions derive from.
 (And to this gamer's mind, the original <i>AD&D</i> rules were the
 ultimate set of rules for the game&mdash;all subsequent versions mainly
 being ploys to make money off of gamers who had previously believed
 themselves happy with what they had.)
 <p>
 The original booklets sell for hundreds of dollars on the collector
 market, and there is just no way Hasbro will re-release the original
 rules or license any authorized copies.

 (Did you notice that?  Everything available from this web page is
 covered by copyright.  While I can certainly make reproductions for my
 own use, I cannot legally (in general) provide them to other people.
 Therefore the directory they reside in is password protected.)
 <p>
 If you want the password, please send me an email with your real name and
 a statement to the effect that you currently own the original rules and
 you would like access to these facsimiles for your personal convenience,
 or academic or historical interest in the history of role-playing games.
 Then I'll send you a password.
 <p>
 The facsimiles are rekeyed and saved as searchable PDF files.  If you
 notice a typo or other errata, please drop me a line.  Note that I've
 tried to maintain the original flavor of the books, using simple fonts
 and formatting.  The result is almost, but not quite, a page-by-page
 reproduction of the rule books.  The point is to make the original
 material available, not to try to reproduce the exact results of 1970's
 word processing.
