 <h1>Model 100 Year 2000 Menu Display Patch</h1>

 <p>
 <strong>WARNING!</strong>  This patch has been tested on <em>one and
 only one</em> Model 100, i.e. the one on my desk.  It has 32k of RAM.
 This has not been tested on machines having less RAM, nor has it been
 tested on the Model 102 or 200.  I've noticed side effects on my machine
 when running machine-language programs.  Usually these side effects
 resulted in locking the machine up or cold restarts causing memory loss.
 <strong>Make a backup!</strong>  I haven't tested for effects on the
 built in apps as yet.  BASIC <em>should</em> pose no problem as the
 program reserves for itself a small amount of high memory.  <strong>You
 Have Been Warned.  Caveat Utilitor.  Your Mileage May Vary.</strong>
 <p>
 Bug and side effect reports are welcome, but I doubt I'll be able to
 do much about them.  This patch is no way as good a solution as patching
 and burning a new ROM.  (By the way, if you can patch the ROM, set addr
 5A53h = 32h and addr 5A56 = 30h and away you go!)

 <p>
 <h2>Background</h2>
 The TRS-80 Model 100 was created in a joint venture between Kyocera
 (for the hardware) and Microsoft (for the software).  The Model 100 has
 an attractive main menu display, which displays the date in the form
 "<tt>Jun 20,1998 Sat 13:15:36</tt>".
 <p>
 The Model 100's real-time clock chip is a uPD 1990AC which stores a
 BCD represntation of month, day of week, day of month, hours, minutes
 and seconds.  It also produces a pulse that drives a background process
 interrupt.  Conspicuously absent is the year.  The Model 100 works
 around this by storing the 2-digit year as 2 BCD digits in locations
 F92Dh and F92Eh and updating these by comparing the month reported
 by the 1990AC with a copy stored in addr F655h.  The day-of-week is
 maintained in a separate register in the 1990AC, and not calculated.
 If you decide today is Sunday, the chip will happily believe you and
 tell you tomorrow is Monday, regardless of the actual day and date.
 This makes our task considerably easier.
 <p>
 Nowhere in the internal workings of the Model 100 is the century
 stored or used.  BASIC programs may therefore have year 2000 issues
 beyond the scope of this document.  However, as noted above, the 
 century is displayed on the main menu.
 <p>
 At addr 5A15h is the routine that grabs the real time clock data and
 formats it for menu screen output.  Notable in this routine are these
 instructions:
 <p>
 <pre>
 5A4Fh:	MVI  M,2Ch  ; store a comma
        INX  H      ; increment memory pointer
        MVI  M,31h  ; store the digit '1'
        INX  H      ; increment memory pointer
        MVI  M,39h  ; store the digit '9'
 </pre>

 (As noted above, if you can patch the 31h and 39h to read 32h and 30h,
 your work here is done.  Feel free to let me know if you have this
 capability; i'd be happy to do business with you!)
 <p>
 The 5A15h routine uses a scratch pad starting at FD88h to build the 
 output string, and the "19" gets dropped into the two bytes FD8Fh and
 FD90h.  If one had a way of changing these values before the instruction
 that copies them to the LCD display is called, surely we'd be in Nirvana.
 But the LCD update is called just a few instructions later.
 <p>
 <h2>Method</h2>
 Enter the background process, mentioned above.  256 times per second
 the real time clock prods the RST 7.5 interrupt line on the 8085
 processor, causing the routine at 003Ch to be executed.  Eventually,
 this takes us to F5FFh where we find three bytes encoded
 <p>
 <pre>
 F5FFh: RET
        NOP
        NOP
 </pre>
 <p>
 Three bytes is just the right amount for a JMP instruction to take
 us to the code of our choice, just as the designers intended.  (They
 <em>did</em> intend that, right?)
 <p>
 Following is a BASIC program that reserves 16 bytes of memory for
 our update routine, pokes in the relevant processor instructions,
 then (very carefully) enables the patch by changing the bytes at
 F5FFh.
 <p>

 290 DATA 201 :'         RET
 999 END '               END    Y2K
 1000 ' Code to disable the patch
 1001 ' if needed
 1010 POKE 62975,201 '  RET
 </pre>
 <p>
 The code pushes registers that may be affected, then goes to store the
 "20" in the right place.  It's certainly overkill to do this 256 times
 per second, and will likely have a performance impact.  Unfortunately,
 there's no hook provided in the date string builder routine.  The POKE
 at line 1010 restores the original RET instruction, disabling the patch.

 <h2>Side Effects</h2>
 The program uses the uppermost 16 bytes of free user memory (starting
 at MAXRAM - 16) to store the patch.  Any machine language program that
 will use that area will need to have the patch disabled by restoring
 the RET instruction to F5FFh.
 <p>
 I haven't determined whether the scratch pad at FD88h is used by any
 builtin programs.  Obviously, the menu doesn't need it during at those
 times, and it appears that it isn't updated.  A way of determining
 when one is in the menu program is desirable.
 <p>
 I'm uncertain whether MAXRAM - 16 will be a suitable location for all
 users to store the patch.  I need to rewrite the code to make that a
 settable variable.  (Not hard, just haven't gotten there yet.)

 <h2>Conclusion</h2>
 I would rather the designers left off the century entirely than hard-code
 it to "19".  This program should be considered a stopgap until a ROM
 upgrade facility is available.  Perhaps one could get the Department
 of Justice to cause Microsoft to pick up the tab for this...
