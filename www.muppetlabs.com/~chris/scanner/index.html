Scanning is a fun and useful hobby.  Information obtained from a scanner
can save your life or provide a moment's amusement.
<p>
People and governments that seek to restrict the use of scanners in the
name of "privacy" miss the point:  If you don't want a thing heard, do
not say it; and especially do not say it on a radio.
<p>
(Your cellular phone is a radio!  Since it's illegal to listen
to cellular frequencies, the only people listening are criminals.
Do you want criminals listening to your phone calls?  Practice safe
communication!  Privacy is the responsibility of the transmitting party.
That's <em>you</em> if you're talking on a cell phone.  Get a digital
unit.  Insist that your carrier provide you with encryption. And don't
talk about your neighbors -- they might be listening!)
