<h1>Realistic DX-440 Shortwave Receiver</h1>
A portable scanning receiver capable of receiving frequencies from 150
kHz through 30 MHz, in AM, with SSB possible by engaging a beat frequency
oscillator.  9 memory channels.  Wide and narrow filters pass 6 and 3 KHz
or so, respectively.  Scans in 5 KHz steps in the SW broadcast bands,

stereo broadcasts in 88 - 108 MHz

A quite useful unit.  I take it camping and use it as an alarm clock.
