<h1>Grundig FR-200 AM/FM/SW Receiver</h1>
A lower-range AM/FM/SW unit with a rechargable NiCD battery pack 
and a handcranked dynamo for charging.  Includes a flashlight.  Tunes
88-108 MHz FM Broadcast, 530-1710 kHz AM broadcast, 3200-7600 kHz and 
9200-22000 kHz shortwave coverage.
<p>
Can be powered from rechargable battery, 2 AA cells, or 4.5v external
source.  The manual claims 40-60 minutes of radio operation after a 
brisk crank of 120 RPM for 90 seconds.
<p>
Antenna is 65 cm telescoping whip; no jack for external antenna.
I can receive several strong SW stations, but not getting WWV at 
1700 localtime.  AM and FM commercial broadcast reception is very
good, and there's a swell carrying case.
