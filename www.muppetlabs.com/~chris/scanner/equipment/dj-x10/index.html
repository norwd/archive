<h1>Alinco DJ-X10 Wideband Communications Receiver</h1>
A handheld scanner capable of receiving frequencies from 150 kHz through
2 GHz, in AM, LSB, USB, NFM, WFM and CW modes.  Has two VFOs, 1200 memory
channels in 30 banks of 40 and 20 sets of scan edges.
<p>
The unit has a programmable set of automatic settings (for instance,
you can cause the range 88-108 MHz to default to WFM mode).  Most
settings can be programmed via the keypad, but a shareware program
is available for DOS.
<p>
The radio has a 40-channel spectrum scope which may be applied to
VFO A or to a memory channel bank.  A realtime clock is built in
for logging purposes.  Memory channels may have an alphanumeric
tag.  A 20 dB attenuator may be applied to reduce cross modulation.
<p>
The unit includes a modest help feature to remind the user
of the keystrokes to complete a task.
<p>
I've had good luck with the unit in the  VHF and UHF bands up to 
1 GHz; the unit gets a little deaf after that, and only a very 
strong signal gets through from the 1240 MHz amateur band.
Commercial FM comes through strongly, commercial AM less so, but
this and strong shortwave stations come in servicably.  An external
antenna is useful.
