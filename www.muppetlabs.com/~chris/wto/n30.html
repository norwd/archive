<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; CO149: i'm gonna try to get a bite at the market.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; yeah, a march is a good way to get attention.  you stop the normal flow, make folks ask questions about "what's going on?" - random mayhem does nothing to education or spread the word.  it usually only spreads further mayhem.  dammit.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; CIDR: uh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; well, it's west, anyway.

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; if it wasn't so totally illegal i'd die, i'd rebroadcast it
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 4/pine wells fargo locked down
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, that's pretty bad.  i suppose you could stick it somewhere on 430, where not many people would notice
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; or 420, even
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; ooh.  two rules at once!
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 2/pine assulting ppl with chains?

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; except when i'm "working"
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; SWAT teams in riot gear used armored tanks and pepper spray to break up WTO protesters.

<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Slide show | WTO 
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; bus blockade of westin ordered
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; refill these "OC" things?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; OC is a gas
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ah - thought so
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; less irritating than CS
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; so apparently yellow cab/grey top cabbies were told to wear "uniforms" during WTO, so a bunch of them walked out in protest this week.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, I heard there was going to be a taxi strike today, too.
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; deadman: heheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i recall something similar happend during apec
<br>&lt;poon&gt; http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/PugetSoundTraffic/cameras/imagehtml/cctv117a.htm
<br>&lt;poon&gt; is the bus in that picture blocking pine?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; si
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 7/pine flamethrower
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; uh
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; Yeah, the bus is blocking pine
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; flamethrower?
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; he definitely said flamethrower
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "flamethrower type device"
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; Anarchists should have flamethrowers.. 
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; careful what you wish for
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; totally.
<br>* CIDR back - did a walk-thru - couldn't resist
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "things are a little messy in your general downtown area"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; damn.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; port cops to rally
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; what news do ye bring?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; glad to see those kids get some real action
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; water bottles to 8/seneca
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; there are buses, cops or dumpsters blocking basically every intersection.
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; Woa
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; most major stores have at least one window broken out
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; jesus
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; but you can walk through it?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well, CIDR has "powers"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; looks like seafirst took the worst hit, though
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; CIDR is one with the night
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; hah!
<br>&lt;hades&gt; "flamethrower-type device" is probably this guy I know, spitting kerosene out his mouth and lighting it.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; er, which seafirst?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Freak.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh yeah.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; nevermind.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; there were a bunch of assholes dragging trashcans into the middle of the street and emtpying them for no reason
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; 4/pike
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; armand de tobasco
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i saw dr. blase running around w/ a camera :)
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; excellent
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; in his element.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; glad to see that kid see some action

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; i *bet*
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; damn, that warms my heart.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; lots of spraypaint and gargabe.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; er, garbage
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; lots of buses parked in seemingly random patterns.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; ladder, paint, awning, anarchist
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; lots of stores closed early.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; noodle ranch closed
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; doh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.  'box is going to sleep through all of this.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; and he's gonna be *pissed*
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; when the revolution came, he was supposed to wear something pretting and bring snacks.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; a lot of people walking around in some kind of hippie ninja gear - black hippie clothes and face masks.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; those are the anarchists
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *barf*
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; some of 'em got tired of the masks and took 'em off to carry them, though.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; which kinda sorta defeats the point, i think.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; dr0ks
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; there was one guy who was selling a gasmask.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; how much?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; dunno - he was just yelling "gasmask!  last chance!  last one i got!"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; but the guy who plays the clarinet on the corner of 6/pine was still there, playing away :)
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; I fucking *hate* it when people who just want to smash shit up call themselves "anarchists".  Read some political history, assholes.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; "Green bud! Gasmask! Green bud! Gasmask!"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; aquinas: indeed
<br>* deadman considers walking down and shouting "doses! doses!"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; oh, yeah - lotsa folks getting stoned.  heh.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; motorcycle accident boren/pine
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, nothing is worse than a stupid "anarchist".  real pet peeve of mine.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; so...how's the wto going, i wonder? delegates prolly having lunch right about now.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; cops plans down the toilet
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yep
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; regrouping and redeploying after protest
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "whenever that is"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "next week"
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; you want to bond together in autonomous collectives in order to build a self-sufficient community *and* smash shit up *then* you can call yourself an anarchist.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "cops to seattle:  'see ya in december'"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; aquinas: *yes*
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; who's looking for the first-aid stand?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; EMT volunteers
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; secret service prowling around
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "they say those are their guys"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; yeah.  right.

<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heart attack subject?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; i heard it was a little exciting downtown
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; seemingly.

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; CO149: yeah, i was thinking more like it cut off his oxygen supply or something.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; yeah.  it's not for the faint of heart.  so to speak
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; the sheraton actually looked mostly ok, from the little of it i could see.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; it hadn't tipped over?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; it didn't seem to be on fire or anything.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; how far up did you walk?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; to 6th - couldn't go any further east than that.

<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh - no surprise there.  the streets are already full of buses that aren't going anywhere.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; er.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; brooke reports that the WTO has been closed down for today, due to delegates not being able to get where they wanna go

<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; different agency

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; i did once.  it was all i could do to keep from giggling
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; I bet
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yeah, that was my experience at the ones i went to in boston.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; hmm, some more chatter re: chemical agents
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; that's my experience reading the mag
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; and battery chargers
<br>* CO149 makes a note:  diable cop battery chargers
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i saw emmanuel goldstein at defcon - he looked *tired*
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; secret service starting to freak.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; exposed on east side of paramount
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i don't think i'd want to be anywhere near a bunch of freaked out secret service dudes.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; no doubt.
<br>* aquinas would pay a dollar to anyone who wanted to run into the breach shouting "I killed Kennedy, I killed Kennedy!"
<br>&lt;poon&gt; private frequency being used by protesters: 469.5000
<br>&lt;poon&gt; CO149, is that at all meaningful to you?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; or hades/anyone
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; yeah
<br>* CO149 breaks out another scanner
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; woohoo!
<br>* KP875 goes out to buy a scanner six pack
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; KP875: pick me up a half-rack of those to, would'ja?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; aquinas: especially if they are wearing a sign that says "i am a bomb"
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; HEH

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; i get a base station, but not handhelds
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; mostly chatter about what the cops are doing
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; what "situation at the terminal"?
<br>* CO149 hits fcc.  see if he can see who's licensed on that freq
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "voluntary compliance"
<br>* CO149 grabs the DOUBLE_PIGTAIL
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; cops on left whoever this other radio is on right
<br>&lt;poon&gt; hehe
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; hehe
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; someone barricaded something and broke a window.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; sounds like you need some SKUNK_WEED
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; closed opening ceremonies, but meetings continue
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; ppl are instructed to keep up the heat
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; uh

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; certainly seems as though 469.5 is direct action HQ
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; CO149: they gonna climb any more cranes?
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; sec.  "working"

<br>&lt;poon&gt; they're busting the windows of old navy now
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; excellent
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i thought they already busted all of those.
<br>* poon MUST go get some pics of a busted up old navy
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; me too.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; all of 'em?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; guess not.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; this is ludicrous
<br>&lt;poon&gt; "WTO - watch out, this could be your town"
<br>&lt;poon&gt; the cops sound stressed out
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yeah.  most of these morons get to go back to eugene or wherever.  we gotta stick around and deal with this crap.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; fuckin' hippie wanna-be's.  "Write a letter!"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; someone needs officer mazuka's location.
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; just make sure you have it all nice and pretty by sunday, k?
<br>* IJ89 discovers that the store which has the boots he wants to try on is located less than 5 blocks from the RS where RJL20 got his scanner
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; ...and only three blocks from Old Navy!
<br>&lt;poon&gt; holiday shopping is going to be so fucked after this
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; very true
<br>&lt;poon&gt; IJ89:  maybe you could be in proximity when the looting starts
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; TEE2: i'm looking for a good place to order "urban cleaning squad" online now.
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; This riot was funded by the online-shopping lobby
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; actually, holiday shopping is probably a reason why it *will* get totally cleaned up in two days.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; .msg DDM73 sssshhhh!!!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; aquinas: true.
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; CIDR: thanks, you're the best!
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; SHIT.. <sorry>
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; big march headed north, 5/union
<br>&lt;poon&gt; "riots don't happen online"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; mmm.  i *finally* found a bootmaker which makes widths
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; Tue Nov 30 16:21:57 PST 1999
<br>&lt;poon&gt; wsdot cam looking good this time of day
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; american flag burning at niketown
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; woohoo!
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; tracheotomy at 5/pine
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; prot calling 911
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; wtf?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; *shrug*
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; what's with the trach?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; and wtf are they calling 911??
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "they're already there"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; heheheeh
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 999-4116 is either a precinct captain or asst cheif joiner
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "no one saw that"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; trach person drives away.  never mind 911
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; weird
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 1/stewart trash can+window
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; wtf
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; a curfew?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; prot base announces successful closedown of WTO and units may return
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; woohoo!
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; who mentioned a curfew?
<br>* IJ89 prepares to order a buncha CDs from cheapbytes.  anyone want anything?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; prot meeting at 6:30 at boren park
<br>* CO149 trying to confirm curfew
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; news says that Mayor Schell has declared a "Civil Emergency" (not marshall law) and a curfew is in place from 7pm
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; uh.  who does that apply to?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; am i not to be out braffin' on my mean scooter after 7?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; unknown
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; komo being emoyional
<br>* IJ89 does not like curfews
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; it's not who - it's where - from Denny to Yesler from the waterfront to I-5 
<br>&lt;poon&gt; www.cnn.com has a great photo
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ah
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; poon: heh, yeah
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; king tv confirms curfew
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; damn.  guess i won't be going to the space tonight
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; sweeeeet
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; rumor of nat'l guard
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; aquinas: is that a "no one go there" or, "no one who is throwing bottles and lighting dumpsters on fire go there"?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; you need "justifications"
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; IJ89: if you do, bring a sleeping bag
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>* KP875 has your justifications right here.  *grab*
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; crowbars, bats and boards.
<br>* IJ89 tunes up KIRO TV
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; neato.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; KING5 just stated that the Nat'l Guard rumor is bogus - they say the mayor has decided that the "Civil Emergency" powers are enough for the local police to clean up wit
<br>* IJ89 will stay clear of downtown
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; hmm.  sounds like a sneak-attack!
<br>* IJ89 wonders if alaskan way will be closed due to curfew
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; it's in the zone
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; oh, you mean the viaduct?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that would be a silly maneuver, if you ask me
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; whats the zone
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; denny to yesler, 1-5 to water
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; denny to yesler, 1-5 to waterfront
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; er.  i-5, not 1-5.. heh
<br>* poon no want cheapbytes methinks
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; wtf did we both make that mistake, CO149?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; yup!
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; kiro says "Battle in Seattle"
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah.  they have some great photos
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; weirdos
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; cider says "kiro sucks"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; KING most definitely sucks as well
<br>* CO149 adds that KOMO sucks.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; they are declaring that the "worldwide headlines declaring violence on the streets..." were bogus- that most of the protests were peaceful and went "as planned"... Can  you believe that shit?!?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that leaves KPCQ.  <pppbpbpbpplt> hahahAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; aquinas: i know, when i talked to my mom she said "oh, it sounds like it's not a big deal - thanks for calling, though.  i'm sure it'll be fine."
<br>&lt;poon&gt; KCPQ?  Q13! i remember when they first started having news reports
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "news"
<br>* hades monitoring
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Man.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; it was relatively peaceful
<br>&lt;hades&gt; That's the busiest I've been in weeks.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i thought it was weird, because it's completely fodder
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; when I was there
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; airspace restricted too
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; tterb: rubber bullets, tear gas, broken windows, burning dumpsters and general mayhem aren't what i'd really call peaceful, but ya know, whatever :)
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; key word being relatively
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; indeed.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; HOly SHIT.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; My scanner is #5 on the shoutcast list.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; 145 people listening to it.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; nice.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; wow
<br>&lt;poon&gt; dang
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; hades, how hard is it to set those up?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Christ, and the batteries are running out. Heh.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; you pumpint that out your cable modem?
<br>* IJ89 wants to get a scanner running on aether
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; er.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i'll kick in some dough for a battery fund.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; ditto.  well worth it
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I'm pumping it out the cablemodem to a friend's machine at the UW, which apparently is rebroadcasting it to 145 people.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; hades: i may well have a wallbug power supply if you need one
<br>* aquinas too - real money even
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; what does "cluster" mean?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I think I've got one too, I was just in a hurry to get to work so I didn't dig through the boxes.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; It was pretty easy to set up. A couple winamp plugins.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; oh, windows?
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; hades: that is great. heh
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; alarm at levi store
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; "and our #5 hit tonight, new on the scene, is a little tune we call 'Seattle Police Scanner'"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hehe
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Mayor Schell is supposed to call a press conference at 5pm - we'll see
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; huh.  KIRO actually reports violence, instead of happy-face news
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yay, KIRO!
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; there seems to have been several "large booms" that are causing panic in the protesters - according to Jim Forman (#23 on the 'When the Revolution Comes' list)
<br>* IJ89 listening to audio-only of KIRO TV
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; aquinas: probably those cluster bomb thingies
<br>* aquinas watching the TV, listening to the shoutcast and monitoring #foo
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; or possibly random acts of weirdness by the other protestors
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Man.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; 156 people listening to my scanner.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I'm *sniff* so proud.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; hades: you totally rock for setting that up so fast, btw.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; no shit - hades for president
<br>&lt;hades&gt; It was a lot easier than I thought it would be.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; WinAmp kicks ass.
<br>* hades heads home to change the batteries or find a wall wart.
<br>* hades -- OUT
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; live coverage of tear-gassing and pepper-spraying toget folks out of the Pine corridor
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; sounds like the KIRO guy got a whiff
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; *excellent*
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "closing peace circle at pine and boren"
<br>&lt;poon&gt; hehehe
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; a what?!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; DDM73: you should go invite 'em over - that's only like two blocks from your place, no?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; don't *you* have one?
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; CIDR: yeah, if it weren't for the funeral home, I could see 'em from my bedroom.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; DDM73: 's what i thought.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; can you get on the roof?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "don't do that"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; I can walk to the courner by the funeral home...
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "don't tease the nice snipers"
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; I've gone down there with binocs a few times today.. didn't see much
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; it's the "black-clad protesters" that are setting off m-100's according to KING5
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; aquinas: bitchin'.  maybe they'll start launching roman candles next.
<br>* deadman back
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; I'll get my sparklers
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; or sparklers
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; doh!
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; mmm
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; one of the guys from the company we just bought is up from california.  his hotel is on stewart so he's on the phone trying to find somewhere else to stay
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; hahaha
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; nat'l guard confirmed by governor
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; whoops.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "ha ha only serious"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; fuck
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; not the national guard
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; fuckin' KING5 - they just dismissed the Nat'l guard thing as ""just a rumor"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; KIRO man literally chased out of the area
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; JIm Forman just had his camera vandalized and now they are breaking the windows in the bon
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; erm.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; isn't there some weather happening somewhere for jim forman to go stand in?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; deadman: yeah, it's raining teargas downtown :)
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; yeah, it's called strange Teargas clouds
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; doh!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>* aquinas will keep it to himself
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Stamper, Sims, Locke, and Schell all together in a press conference - Nat'l Guard has been activated
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; where?
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; i'm gonna walk home soon.  i think i'll walk up to about 5th and see how close i can safely get to pike/pine before heading up the hill
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; didn't say  - they ahven't arrived yet is all they said
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; damn - not a good environment to go cruise the 'gaurd.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; er, 'guard
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; what businesses are they closing down?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; SCCC
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; that's what i thought.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; he said broadway, didn't he?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yep.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they'd better not close down vivace
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; they're afraid the rioting will start on broadway.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; due to 7pm curfew downtown.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; fuckin' hell.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i've been worried aobut that all day
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; Errr.. I'm at SCCC right now, and I haven't heard anything
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; there are all sorts of faces on broadway i don't recognize.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; DDM73: cops just sent out the word
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heh
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; just on the news that SCCC is going to close
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; CRAP!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; DDM73: you're always the last to find out....
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "go the fuck home.  now"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; or go to my place, if you want.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i'm gonna take off RSN
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; Shit.. o
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; I'm worried about my car..
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yeah, that's a valid worry.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; I think I might go drive to Bellevue until shit calms down..
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; but i'd be more worried about getting hit in the noggin trying to get it out.
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; fuuuck
<br>&lt;DDM73&gt; I'm off
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; it's pretty tense here in PT
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "i'll call ya later"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; aquinas: it is?
<br>*** Signoff: DDM73 (Sound of Bottle Bouncing of Head)
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; people are all staying in there homes
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; *snrk*
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; HEH.  anyone wanna go shooting tonight?
<br>* IJ89 mostly kidding
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; like you weirdos ever leave your houses, anyway.
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; HEHEH
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; heh - why bother?
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; (yes, i am lurking, i just thought that one was funny)
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; I've got "you people" to entertain me
<br>* IJ89 hears "at least two units of nat'l guard called out"
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; just announced that the Nat'l guard will arrive tomorrow morning - State Patrol is coming as well (300 of the WASPS)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; haven't the staties been here all along?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; or 300 more of 'em?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; not the e. washington ones - 300 additional
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; ah, 'k
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; wow
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; "that's a lotta cops"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; d'oh!  broken windows at benaroya

<br>* poon -&gt; home
<br>&lt;poon&gt; er .. -> out
<br>* deadman gets off the phone with concerned sister-in-law
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; holy shit
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; the brotha's gettin' involved, now?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; dear god
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *please* don't let a race riot break out on top of this.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yeah, could turn real ugly real fast.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; jim forman is *fucked* it's beautiful
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; what's with jimbo?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; he got gassed, bottles are smashing around him and he can't open his eyes
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; oh man.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; heheheheehe
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; damn.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "no spot on good morning america for him
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; unfortunately, we couldn't see it because his camera man had his camera vandalized
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; snrk
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; he get his lens spraypainted?
<br>* IJ89 tries out a yagi-design program to see how hard it'd be to make aquinas that antenna
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; dunno - he didn't say - just "camera vandalized, can't broadcast, can't breath..."
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; that *really* isn't funny.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; but man, it's funny.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; he's probably faking it all, trying to get picked up by a network
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Oh, I'm sure he's fine - no one has got seriously hurt - and he's so damn melodramatic anyway - it's poetic justice thathe got gassed
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; isn't that how Geraldo did it/
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; basically
<br>&lt;poon&gt; this is all nuts
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah.  the whole thing is pretty creepy
<br>* IJ89 comes up with a yagi design that would work for aquinas
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; really?  what is this 'yagi' you speak of, wise one?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Oh man, Jim Forman is *sooooo* melodramatic - you'd think he was in fuckin' Beruit
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; it's an antenna that looks like a bunch of parallel lines.  much like a TV antenna, but with elements about 4 inches long
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; er.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; shots fired?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; hopefully more m-100s
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; if you ran it up-n-down, it'd look like a ladder with a central spine, and gradually increasing rung-length
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; rubber bullets according to JF
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; ah
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; teargas according to komo
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; IJ89: I can picture that - that would be sufficient to get me Seattle scanner traffic?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Mounted on the roof pointed SE would be no sweat
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; even his camera man is laughing at him 
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; aquinas: most likely.  with 14.x dBi gain, it would make the signals... about 5x louder
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 50
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; 50?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 10 ^ 1.4
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i'm thinking S units
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; huh.  ok
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; 50 times louder!
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; how does one construct such a beast?  Can I just run coax down from that to the scanner in the house?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; it's a 17 element beam, max width just over 6", length around 10-ish feet
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, you'd need a transformer to make it work really well, but that's not hard
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "standard issue"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; (20.7 ohm impedance -- would need to be transformed to 50 ohm)
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ah, i lied.  4.1 feet long
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; whew!
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Locke says that nat'l guard will *not* be armed
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i couldn't tell what exactly the "element spacing" column was telling me
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; aquinas: "so what're they supposed to use, harsh language?"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; "these officer are, ah, trained in crowd control..."
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; right  that's what he said
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; IJ89:  how did that column read?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; lemme see if i can get it into a format that makes sense
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; like teh first 5-6 numbers 
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; man, the press is baiting the mayor in this press conference
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; aquinas:  where are you seeing this?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; KING 5
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; btw folks, my deepest thanks to all of you.  this is, basically, one of the reasons i put eidolon together so many years ago.  "good job".
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Ooooh - Norm Stamper is getting grilled and refusing to answer specific questions about the weapons used
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; we are currently some of the best informed people in the entire city, near as i can guess.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; probably.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "including the cops", based on how long it took 'em to get their hands on the protestor's radio stuff.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; heh - no doubt
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; the foreign press is relentless
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; right.  poon, where did you score that tidbit?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, i'd always wanted eidolon to be an central information hub.  this has all come together perfectly.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; scroolback in /home/chris/typescript
<br>* CIDR wonders what the closest open rat shack is
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; drool
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; heh - jf is back in the studio - he looks fine.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; CIDR:  udist
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; is his hair perfect?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; yes.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i assume I5 is all locked down?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; looks open
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; oh, ok.
<br>* CIDR -&gt; home -> udist -> home to work (didn't get alot done today :)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; molotov carryin' barefoot seen downtown.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; aquinas, CO149: /tmp/aquinas-antenna
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; the format should be at least marginally obvious
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; heh - thanks man - I'll snarf it soon
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; and now, i must prepare to fly
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; aquinas: you'll prolly need more than that to get it built, but that's the raw data
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; heh - cool, thanks.  Still not sure I'm up for it, but I'm definitly intrigued after today.
<br>* delores MOTNIROGIN
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; hey, I could *swear* I just saw tterb
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; did he go downtown?
<br>* delores escapes downtown
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah

<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Heh. My office-mate lives in the curfew area. He just found out about the curfew half an hour ago.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; the news is full of shit
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Fortunately he lives right on the edge of it, so I doubt he'll have problems getting home.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; I live in the curfew area as well.
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Someone just set off some roman-candle-type fireworks outside.

<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Yeah, I don't think you'll have much trouble. They're mostly concerned about downtown.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; ok

<br>&lt;cider&gt; that is, after you notice you can't breathe or see.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; by the looks of it on TV - they're driving folks straight to Vivace
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; looking for an emergency number for radio shack so they can board it up
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; lookign for emergency numbers for all businesses in the corridor
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh

<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "backpacks and water jugs"?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; that was where the cops suggested i walk - about ten seconds later and after a few loud "bangs", i realized why no one else was walking down that block.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; and bullhorns
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cider: shit.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, lost the pike came from "eye of the space needle".  no more feed.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; huh, too bad.

<br>&lt;spud&gt; I ran some lights, drove fast, etc.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Didn't see any cops.

<br>&lt;spud&gt; Opportunity for law breaking is great.  Maybe I'll score some crack!

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; forcing the capitalists to play nice, i guess.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; damn - it looks like a wsu frat party downtown.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; 6th and stewart looks ridiculous
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, things were *way* further out of control between olive and westlake than further north, from what i could see.

<br>&lt;spud&gt; That Josh's home box?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; nah, it's at the uw
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; maybe I *should* get coked up
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Ah, I thought this was Josh's work?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; it is - piping from his house to the UW machine
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Ahhhh.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; it's getting rebroadcast from there.,
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh lord.
<br>* cider wonders how to get teargas residue off his leather jacket.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're showing a pocket knife and a wrench
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; on tv
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; for some reason
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "neat"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; some talking media head going on about it.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; this is...channel four
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "these are tools of the terrorist"
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; right, I just saw that - "...they *are* throwing things..."
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i've got the volume down.  images are all i need.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; goddamn direct tv motherfuckers *mumble* *mumble*
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;spud&gt; I never thought I'd say "Damn, I wish I had local news!"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, me neither.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well, i don't want the commentary/analysis
<br>&lt;cider&gt; seriously: anyone know how to treat teargassed leather?  do i just "wet and wipe"?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; but the pics are good
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;spud&gt; It leave a stain?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "not yet"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cider: er, i don't know a damned thing about that gas.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; dunno - but I bet it's more complicated than that
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; get it dry cleaned
<br>&lt;cider&gt; that's what i'm hoping to prevent, as this jacket cost rather a lot, and i think the store i got it at was probably looted not too long ago.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cops appear to be moving on 6th/stewart
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ooh, cnbc is apparently carrying king 5 now
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; blech.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Heh, I wonder if I can pick up that shit on the web.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; cider: are they showing pictures?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; if so, can i come watch? heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: not sure yet, trying to find fuckin' cnbc - the channel guide on this thing *sucks*
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: yeah, lemme try to find it (and put some clothes on)
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; king 5 showing dudes taking TV's from radio shack
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; damn, they beat me to it!
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hrm.  there's nothing left to demonstrate or protest as far as i can tell.  why not call it a night and start over again tomorrow?
<br>* delores MOTNIROGIN

<br>&lt;delores&gt; so, is clinton showing up tomorrow morning?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; I haven't heard that he'd cancelled
<br>&lt;delores&gt; is tomorrow supposed to be just as fucked?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; delores: i dunno, i'm kinda guessing so.
<br>&lt;delores&gt; eeef.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; fuck.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; yeah - although today was supposed to be the big blow out - Clinton coming should give them a 'second wind'
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yep
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;cider&gt; and the natl guard and the secret service will probably not be in a mood to take any shit, which may aggravate things
<br>&lt;delores&gt; dear god.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; what the hell is an "online agency"?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Oh yeah, the SS is not pleased, I'm sure.  
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah.  and those are *not* the droids you're looking for if you wanna start some shit.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; Heh - no shit
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh - caught a helicopter spotlight through my window
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; dramatic photos' of a USA Today box burning at 6th and Stewart
<br>&lt;cider&gt; fuckin' rag, i'm surprised it even burns.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; "dramatic"
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; it doesn't - hence the drama
<br>&lt;cider&gt; oh.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; that's why they called in the guy with the flamethrower earlier !
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i saw that someone wrote "corporate propaganda" on one of the newspaper boxes on 3rd
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh, "flamethrower type device"
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; heh - KOMO keeps showing different trashed USA Today boxes forsome reason
<br>&lt;cider&gt; oh yeah - there was all kinds of shit spraypainted on nordstroms, nike town, adidas, sharper image, etc
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; (I have the sound turned off so I can listen to the scanner)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; aquinas: secret messages
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Did they get Planet Hollywood!?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yep - fucked up all the little handprint thingies
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Yes!
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; didn't notice if there were windows broken or not - the gas was wafting in at that point.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; I would have liked to have been there when they fucked up Old Navy.
<br>* aquinas too
<br>&lt;spud&gt; VTECH vests for everyone!

<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; heh - I remember
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Oooohhhh, they got Nike Town!?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they *totally* destroyed nike town.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Yess!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; apparently they ran all the employees out the back and broke a bunch of stuff.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Just do it!
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Those kids are gonna have to work twice as hard now to make up for the lost cash.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, chasing out a bunch of pimple-faced teens is sending the message to THE_MAN
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh.  i kinda dislike how the property destruction screws over the peaceful demonstrators, but when it comes to nike town and planet hollywood, i don't mind
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh lord.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: indeed
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; who are these guys on ch4?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; TV is showing a bunch of do-gooders mugging for the camera righting paper boxes and garbage cans
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; is that who they are?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; god. damn.it.  - can I just say something first for once?!?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "no"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Heh, what'd ya miss?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; deadman: they're trying to show the world that most of the protesters are non-violent (and really hate messy streets, apparently)
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "oh"
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Lousy Ian McKay wannabes!
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; so it's okay to break curfew if you're righting paper boxes?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; spud: heheheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; over the scanner: "this is not wto related"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; mised what it was in reference to.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; stupid fucks are being caught on live TV stealin' shit from RS - even loading it in their cars , license plates in clear view
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; what idiots

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Man, Radio Shack is just not worth going to jail for.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; totally
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; my opinion of americans isn't really high right now.  heh.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; mine is just being confirmed - largely a race of stupid, but cunningly opportunistic fucks, we are
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; many copters of cap hill right now, it sounds like.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; or just one big loud one.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; yeah - king5 is showing folks getting driven up Pine to B'way

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; what's all that yellow shit on the road?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; that's just shit that came off of ciders jacket
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *ah*
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; damn.  i don't understand why all these folks are looking in the cameras and smiling.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; wtf is there to smile about?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; damn, americans piss me off sometimes.  
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i keep trying to compare this to civil disobedience acts in other countries.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they tend to take that stuff seriously
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; here, it's like we just wanna get on tv.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hrm.  local coverage appears to be ending, for the most part.

<br>*** IJ89 is now known as reaper
<br>* reaper motnirogin
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; looks like it was a fun night
<br>* reaper is absolutely convinced he wants a scanner now
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, scanners rule
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; heh.  i can catch "a channel at a time" of the trunk stuff, but it's not the same
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; someone's on the roof of the funeral home at melrose/pine
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i hear sirons.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; sirens, rather.
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; i bet
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; olive/westlake need a prisoner processing bus
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; a metro bus, apparently.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; not a van, but a bus
<br>* reaper imagines a huge meat grinder mounted in a schoolbus
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ah - they need transport for 30 officers to melrose/pine
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; deadman reaper
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; spiff
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; parent informed of the lack of my demise, and now I may commence to get drunk
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; spiff
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cops at bellevue/pine wondering what to do
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; heh.  go spiff!
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; spiff: heheheh
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; you gonna show 'em?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; whee!
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "let me go change"
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; lol
<br>* reaper ponders food, since he didn't really eat anything at lunch
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.  cops told to don masks as there's a fair amount of gas
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cops at 7th/seneca about to move to stewart
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; how's the street-by-street sweep?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; mostly done, it sounds like.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; most of the action on cap hill now
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're moving on 6th/stewart.  pincer move.
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; right.  our democratic heroes still heady with the lust of perceived vistory
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; with crews behind 'em to keep folks from coming up that way
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; no kidding
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; heh.  and why not.  they won
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; folks being funneled towards 1st, told that can't happen
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; right.  mayor lives on 1st
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cops want 1st totally clear due to concerns for "tonight's activities"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *ah*
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; didn't know that.
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; and there's a basketball game i think
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; there is.
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; Lakers
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're trying to figure out what the hell to do about keeping 1st clear.  wsp very concerned, apparently.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; (and lakers were up last  i checked)
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; hehehehehe
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cops trying to get 5 metro drivers to move some busses
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; damn.  taking 'em forever to move on 6th/seneca
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; and stewart
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're still coordinating
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; orders are changing
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh - they've lost the auburn task force.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; folks moving east on pine
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; they had to go home and eat some donuts?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're gonna be hitting broadway no doubt

<br>* cider MONITORING
<br>&lt;cider&gt; jesus fuck
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i just had a deluge of phone calls from the east coast wondering if i was dead
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; cider
<br>&lt;cider&gt; reaper
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; dunno if you got my message.  "glad you're not dead"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; bellevue/e olive.  someone in resporitoary distress
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; an officer, i think.
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; damned asthmatics
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "damed allergic to tear gas people!"
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; reaper: yeah, thanks - i was pretty much at a loss as to how to get home when i called ya
<br>&lt;cider&gt; the cops were friendly, but ultimately unhelpful at that point.
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; yeah.  i think i was just getting on the freeway towards <shudder> lynnwood when you called
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they didn't seem to have a clearer idea of what was going on than i did.
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; heh
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; i doubt i coulda helped...
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; core of individuals in some intersection
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, i was mostly looking to hear about where the shit was going down, so i could try to avoid it.
<br>* reaper notes that no one makes a motorcycle boot worthy of his feet
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; trying to move them north.  dunno if this is the downtown folks or eh 'hill folks
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; ah.  well, who knows...  i coulda asked the protesters for ya... ;)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; so i've not been keeping score - is broadway consumed yet?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; not yet.
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; i don't think so
<br>&lt;cider&gt; reaper: heheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're working their way this way.  cops trying to figure out a way to stop them without it blowing up.  about 5-600 folks.
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; (seriously, i can talk on their freqs, for hte most part)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; reaper: yeah, i saw that 
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: neato
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; a bunch of the protesters seem to be using FRS radios
<br>&lt;cider&gt; office at bellevue still breathing on his own.
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; hmm
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; Tue Nov 30 20:42:55 PST 1999
<br>&lt;cider&gt; FRS?
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; like wtf?
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; frs == family radio service
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah.
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; why wouldn't he breathe?
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; easily obtainable cheap radios that are limited to .5 watt
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.  i'm lagged behind cider.  heh.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; spiff: i think he was having ... difficulty.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; breathing.  or something.
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; sounded like he mighta been gassed
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; but anyway.  it's time for food
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; right
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; i'll check back in a bit
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; food

<br>&lt;cider&gt; wade
<br>&lt;wade&gt; jeezus.  what is going on at broadway and denny?
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; wade!
<br>&lt;wade&gt; cider.

<br>&lt;wade&gt; poolgirl
<br>&lt;cider&gt; bomb squad at denny /bway
<br>&lt;cider&gt; dumpster full of material in pine and harvard - "it is not on fire, yet"
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Heh, just heard that.
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; spud!
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Heya poolgirl, what goes on?
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; "nothing, here"
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; you guys are having all the fun
<br>&lt;cider&gt; woohoo!
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Tonight would be a great night to test a scanner.
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; hehe
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Heh, 20 tacoma cops wanna get into the action!
<br>&lt;wade&gt; pine and harvard - dumpster on fire.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Sounds like they're all switching fequencies.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah
<br>* poon just back from a drive/walk around
<br>&lt;spud&gt; See anything cool?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; there are cops in riot gear all over
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; poon!
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Capitol hill?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;poon&gt; bellevue/olive intersection, there's at least 5 cops in riot gear on every corner
<br>&lt;cider&gt; sounds like it - the dumpster's on fire now 
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah, cp. hill
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah, i was just past there.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; but is vivace open?
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; okie, i am going to start making you all check in on the hour - you are starting to scare me
<br>&lt;poon&gt; it looks like the crowd is by rudy's barber shop
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Spiff must be having a blast.  He's got the wicked cool scanner.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah, i woudl guess vivace will be open for awhile
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i know safeway locked down
<br>&lt;poon&gt; "closed"
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i don't know what else - probably a lot.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; sounds like they're gonna arrest everyone.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Damn, those people could really use somebody with a scanner in thier midst.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; spud: they've got 'em
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they were coordinating the whole thing via radio earlier.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Heh, cool.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; CO149 and IJ89 were monitoring the demonstrators.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i kinda just wish they'd go the hell home.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; cider: send 'em here 
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; "i'm leaving soon"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; *grin*
<br>&lt;spud&gt; I hope they don't trash the hill.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; how many more days of this? 3?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah, 3
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah i really hope they don't trash the hill
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; yeah, but I bet it's all over after tomorrow
<br>&lt;poon&gt; hopefully
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i bet security is going to be much tougher tomorrow
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; once clinton is gone and they've smoked all the skkunk weed, there'll be nothing left to protest
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Damn!  We got to get up at 6!
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh.  
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Hehe!
<br>&lt;poon&gt; curfew lifts when?
<br>&lt;spud&gt; 7am.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; if the riots die down, you could stand at the top of the Pike Tower, spud, and throw hundreds of one dollar bills into the crowd - that'd put a spark back in 'em
<br>&lt;spud&gt; HEH!  And restore thier faith in money!
<br>&lt;spud&gt; CONSUME!  CONSUME!
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; spud saves the day for capitalists everywhere to be free to be greedy!
<br>&lt;wade&gt; where are the protesters being processed after they're arrested?
<br>&lt;spud&gt; The killing fields.  Mmmm.  Soilent protester.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; heh
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; at the soylent green company in sodo
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; doh!
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Doh!
<br>&lt;spud&gt; I misspelled it!
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; I. Want. To. Be. First. With. The. Joke. Just. Once. Today.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; aquinas, it's just *not* your day
<br>&lt;wade&gt; in city or are they bussing them away?
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Heh, I've been lagging behind the curve today myself.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; no kidding
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wade: they were hauling a bunch out to sandpoint earlier
<br>&lt;cider&gt; dunno what they're doing with them now
<br>&lt;wade&gt; seems like sand point would be a good choice.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; yeah, they mentioned on the scanner that they had a holding pen at sand point
<br>&lt;wade&gt; why are these people fucking up my city again?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wade: because a different bunch of assholes are here trying to have a meeting.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Becuase corporations are evil.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; And angry mobs are good.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; oh, that.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "because fucking up cities is fun"
<br>&lt;spud&gt; So many reasons.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; just checking, thanks.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; "the skunk week made them do it"
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; er, weed... FUCK!
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;spud&gt; I'm afraid I missed the initial skunk weed reference.  Although I remember Deadman wanting to smoke up Broadway.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; spud: it's probably in chris' scrollback file
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; was that from the scanner?
<br>&lt;wade&gt; HAH!
<br>&lt;spud&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;wade&gt; thanks aquinas.  first time i've genuinely laughed in a few hours!
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; (I was the first one to make the joke!  Victory is mine!)
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; np
<br>&lt;wade&gt; i'm still laughing if that counts for anything.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; You should do a little dance.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; I'm doing one as we speak.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; if you're talking to me - I *always* do a little dance when I'm victorious
<br>&lt;cider&gt; more window breakage downtown
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; it's on eidolon, isn't it?  MOTD?
<br>&lt;wade&gt; to which i lack an account.
<br>* cider hears lots of sirens and helicopters
<br>* spiff downed 4 cokes during today's eventery.   things were *tense*
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; then, i ended up at 4/jackson before i found the correct bus
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; you can imagine the fun i had going there from belltown
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; HTS arriveth. 
<br>* spiff prolly out
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; 'night
<br>* kirk returns
<br>&lt;cider&gt; gas in use on broadway.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; shit - I'm gonna have to turn on the TV - is the scanner back up?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, we stood at broadway and pike for quite a while
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: you guys get gassed?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; people were turning over dumpsters and setting them on fire.  others tried to clean up but finally gave up
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; the police finally got there and threw out some flash-bangs and tear gas
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; things cleared up, so we decided to walk back on broadway instead of a smaller street, only the tear gas floated right with us so we got it pretty bad
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, it's pretty neat, eh?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, for about 30 seconds it was to the point where we couldn't open our eyes or breath without choking, but it cleared up fast when we got off broadway
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; how nice
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; pretty nasty stuff, considering we were just watching from a distance, looking out for stupid protestors as much as police
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh, it was interesting to see how flash-bangs work
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Ya?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; are the cops chasing folks up b'way - or are they satisfied w/pushing them up that far?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; looks like everyone pretty much scattered.  i'm not sure if they are regrouping or anything, the ones left doing the stuff are pretty idiotic
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Does the flash come before the bang or at the same time?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; spud: i think it was at the same time
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; they threw them right into the crowd, so they must be designed to not do any damage
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; ...to not project any shrapnel or anything
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i'm pretty certain they don't have any "damaging" effects other than severe disorientation.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Was it pretty disorienting?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; and they didn't really flash that much.  we were like 100 feet away, looking in the general direction and it was like any moderate firework
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Anything on broadway open?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; dunno, we headed up to vivace but they were closed.  heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; deadman wanted his coffee
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Belltown is pretty damn quiet.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; they aren't trashing broadway are they?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i didn't see anyone on broadway accept for where it meets pine.  all they were doing is turning over dumpsters and lighting them on fire
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; they stopped at the intersection and blocked some cars, then realized that maybe busses weren't evil and should let them pass
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; overall, it was pretty stupid
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; lots of people walked past us and said stupid things like "things are going to change!" and stuff
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Ya, neat.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; yeah, the price of skunk weed is going to go up
<br>* spud prepares to riot.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; we made fun of them pretty loudly.  one guy walked by and asked "is that smoke or tear gas".  it was smoke from the burning dumpster, so i said "smoke" and when he got about 30 feet away i yelled "oh wait, it's tear gas"
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; he flipped me off
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; we laughed pretty hard
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh
<br>* BR903 MOTORINGIN briefly
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; It's funny - when I arrived at Broadway, all the businesses were already closed up.
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; But the people were still out, as much as any other evening on Broadway.
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; The restaurants that were still open were packed.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; So this action you saw kirk - it was at Broadway & Pike?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; pine actually
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Okay, if it isn't going to get any closer to me I'm not going to worry.
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Sounds like it's already pretty much died down for the night.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; jim forman sounds like he's given up 
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; it all petered out at broadway and denny
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; firetrucks just hosed off some dumpsters there.  all kinds of trash in the road.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, the tear gas was pretty interesting
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; eh?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh, got a wiff of gas earlier
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; it was a fascinating, and strongly unpleasant, sensation.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; okay - bedtime
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; 'night, #foo
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i think i got a bigger wiff than deadman. heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; well, if we couldn't have walked away from it, it would have been *really* unpleasant
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;hades&gt; http://www.elsewhere.org/wto/
<br>&lt;cider&gt; nice!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; is the scanner back up now?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, seems to be.  thanks!
