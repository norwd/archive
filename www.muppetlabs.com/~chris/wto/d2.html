<br>&lt;deadman&gt; this is apparently the first time a curfew like this has been imposed in seattle since "...the army ordered japanese citiezens off the street in world war II".

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; county councilman brian derdowski's negative comments on the way the cops handled things last night are absent from the seattletimes story
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; Early into this morning, riot police lobbed round
<br>&lt;kirk&gt;                               after round of concussion grenades, which are meant to startle but
<br>&lt;kirk&gt;                               not injure people, at a ragtag mob that seemed eager for a fight.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; "eager for a fight"?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that's you, kirk
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; deadman: there was a really cool story on NPR this morning -- "we interviewed 10 to 15 people up here [on cap hill] and they all live here, and say they don't understand why the police are attacking them"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; it was right in line with what i experienced first-hand last night, which was refreshing

<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i love this one:

<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; she was freaked and hiding when i got home from work yesterday, but weathered it okay.  only seemed a little concerned when the grenades went off...curled up under my feet for that.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; the thing that truly urked me was the sweep of folks off of broadway around 10:30-ish
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; that was so completely unecessary and stupid
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; look at the bright side of that.  all the real creeps went to siege teh precinct
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; but yeah.  cops and broadway do not mix.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; yeah, was talking with don at vivace this morning.

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; hades, can you pick up 469.500 from home?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Lemme check.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; maybe we should give the protesters a turn on shoutcast
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; ooo
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; yeah.
<br>* CIDR can't get the shoutcast any more for some reason
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Not hearing anything on 469.500
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; kinda quiet at this instant
<br>&lt;hades&gt; What's up?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; anything just now?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Nope, just static.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; dang

<br>&lt;hades&gt; What's on that freq?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; protester dispatch
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Aha.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, I'm in the shadow of QA hill. If there's someone transmitting from downtown I can't hear it unless it's being relayed off the columbia tower, pretty much.

<br>* DC1020 MONITORING again
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; prolly more protesters in the southern part of downtown, or something.  maybe the cops have started shooting citizens
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; (i noticed on the news last night that stamper inferred that protesters were not citizens)
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; (citizens would have homes in the city in which they would be hiding from the police presence.  protesters would be in the streets, then.)
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; clearly
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i didn't like the implication that protesters aren't citizens though, sicne the word "citizen" wasn't qualified
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; even assuming all the protesters are from out of town, they're still citizens
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; anyone not from seattle is a barbarian

<br>&lt;SW548&gt; I think we all need "Great Satan" UUID's, so the Iranians can start telling us apart

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; there is a flyer circulating calling for a protest rally against the Seattle
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; Police Department on Capitol Hill at 7:00 p.m. tonight. We do not know the
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; exact location of the event, but it is anticipated that it will occur near
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; Seattle Central Community College. 
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; &lt;/q&gt;
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I thought that was supposed to be at 5:30

<br>&lt;poon&gt; hehe. indeed.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; and take away their clothes
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; I certainly wouldn't go near a cop w/no clothes

<br>* CO149 out
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; it's already building now
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; (the rally)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; er.
<br>* CIDR wonders why the cops should get flamethrowers - they've already got all the other toys.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i think the taking away everyone's clothes idea is swell, though.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; CIDR: you see/hear folk outside?  where's this rally?  are they gassing again?  what's going on? where am i?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; no, it's down hear the college, no, not sure, some freak

<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, i just tried to call him to tell him to expect to be arrested shortly.

<br>&lt;cider&gt; he mentioned he was gonna be marching.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; not exactly sure why.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; protesting the action against residents last night.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; residents protesting the cops messing with protesters
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i managed to score some takeout from noodle studio, though.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; there's irony in there somewhere
<br>&lt;cider&gt; is that at all evident, or are they mixed in with the WTO folks?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; gonna scarf that.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; it was 95% residents, some small wto stuff.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; huh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; just talked to dylan
<br>&lt;cider&gt; apparently there is a lot of talk of a march to the jail.

<br>&lt;BR903&gt; They will probably close before I can get out of here.... *SIGH*.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; BR903: we should make a run for it
<br>* BR903 has not has any vivace coffee since Sunday.
<br>* poon neither
<br>&lt;cider&gt; BR903: you should protest.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; hehe. yes!
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; I can't. I gotta at least stick around until QA signs off on master.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; "good idea"
<br>* poon will sign off for them
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; I mean, I suppose I could just walk out - but it would be awfully unsporting of me.
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; I like our QA folks and do not wish to dump any more work onto them.

<br>&lt;tterb&gt; fuck
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; just arrived.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; was thinking of checking out sccc
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i was too, after i see if it is relatively calm
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I understand there are only 300-350 people.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; So it's probably not too bad.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; eh, I'd like to be there anyway..
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; that seems like a lot
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; there was less than that last night, wasn't there?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Hmm. Yeah, I guess so.
<br>* tterb wonders where he can find coffee
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; about 200/250 at roy/broadway

<br>&lt;hades&gt; James closed to traffic west of broadway.
<br>*** wade (wade [whirlpool] onetouch.net) has joined channel #foo
<br>&lt;hades&gt; group moving, with police escort
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; no mention of a curfew on broadway
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; The curfew was reported to me by Laura, whom I presume heard it from the media.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; where they at?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm, maybe she saw it on drizzle?  someone mentioned that earlier.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; cityofseattle.gov and nwcn are saying nothing about it
<br>&lt;hades&gt; About 200 people headed towards freeway, presumably on James
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, it may be exagerated
<br>*** LKM15 (morghon [whirlpool] twinpeaks.drizzle.com) has joined channel #foo
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, no curfew on broadway as far as i can tell.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; eww, student activists on nwcn.  i think i'm going to mute it
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Er.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, the first statement one of them made was pretty lame
<br>&lt;hades&gt; ANd about 100-150 people headed _east_ on james
<br>* TT205 MOTNIROGIN
<br>&lt;hades&gt; under i-5 now.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; 2-300 in the jail's plaza, not leaving
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; on james?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; 's what they said
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; isn't that pretty far from sccc?
<br>* wade MONITORING
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; or have they moved that far already?
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Well, whoever may have reported it on drizzle probably got it from the media, so it's much the same thing.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I think perhaps there was something else going on and the two groups are converging
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm..  so is there anyone up at sccc or have they left&gt;?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; i.e. have I missed them
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; In any case, my point was that the media has been a notoriously unreliable source throughout this whole set of events.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; true
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; there may still be folks up there - sec - i'll check out my porch
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; The Media is still at sccc, so there are prolly still a gang of folks there.  and i could hear the folks from downtown marching up.  well, the ones who left the jail, anyway.

<br>&lt;hades&gt; james/broadway, sounds like
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Kirk: for trunking, what you do is enter all the frequencies in the trunk group (as provided by the other manual which came with it), then hit "src" to have it search for the data channel.
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; QA signoff. I am free to go.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Once it's done that, it should start displaying 4-6 digit numbers whenever it tunes in to something.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; BR903: woo!
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Those numbers are the talk groups which correspond to "channels" you can scan for.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; james?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; isn't james down by jackson?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Is it?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; ya
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I'm not familiar with that area. Perhaps they're saying something else and I'm mishearing it.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; there's no james up on the "hill"
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; odd
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; well, i'm gonna go check it out
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; james goes up the hill

<br>* cider seems to be scanning!
<br>&lt;hades&gt; 38 items. Oh dear.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yay, cider!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i just read the six-step instructions, so i don't *really* know what i'm doing, but it says it's "searching", and i'm getting stuff.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; though one of these freq's is nothing but noise
<br>&lt;hades&gt; static noise, or tone-ful data type noise?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; static noise, i think.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hard to say.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Hm.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Does the display read "trunk" in the upper left?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;cider&gt; might be data noise
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Did you press "src"?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; there's a high-freq pulse in it
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Huh.
<br>* deadman to vivace
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i pressed src and it is still scanning or something
<br>&lt;hades&gt; "44880"?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yep
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Go ahead and press "s/s" when you hear that and it'll lock it out.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, cool - thanks
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Hit http://www.elsewhere.org/wto/ and I've got a list of the groups my scanner's listening to.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; 'k
<br>&lt;hades&gt; You can enter them into the scan banks using "Prog"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, so i put the ones in the book in the first - so i put those in the second?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Once you've got the frequencies programmed into the first bank, you can add talk groups to its sub-banks.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I think if you hit prog, then hit the up and down arrows, you'll see it go from 1-10 5 times, each time illuminating a small digit near the middle of the display to indicate which sub-bank you're in.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; To enter a talk group id into a scan bank entry, hit prog, then find the slot you want to put it in using the up/down arrows, then type the id and hit "E"
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I think that's how it works. If the manual sez otherwise, believe it.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; whoa
<br>&lt;cider&gt; bus shot at @ boren/yesler
<br>&lt;hades&gt; *blink*
<br>&lt;cider&gt; van hit w/ gunfire boren/bway
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Good lord.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; struck w/ unknown object
<br>&lt;hades&gt; What group are you hearng that on?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; er
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i'm not too clear on what a "group" is vs. a frequency.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "i just heard it"
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Heh.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; it came out of the magic box.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Trunking's a bit hard to grok at first. It's like ethernet, really.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Youv'e got a bunch of stuff, cables, frequencies, whatever, that you can use to send packets.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Each packet has an ID that identifies where it goes or who it's from.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; van got hit w/ object from pkg garage @ boren/bway, cops en route to investigate
<br>&lt;cider&gt; er, bus.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; no van, apparently.  maybe a metro van.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Once you've got the frequencies entered, it's like having an ethernet segment. The talk groups are the 4-6 digit numbers that appear on the display when the scanner picks something up, and identify the source and destination of the packet you're listento.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; listening to.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ok.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i'm seeing some five digit numbers, too.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; If you're in "search" mode, your scanner is in promiscuous mode and will replort anything it hears on the segment.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; right.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Or you can enter groups into the banks, and only listen to them.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, I guess the numbers can be 2-6 digits.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; The list CO149 sent me is at http://www.elsewhere.org/tmp/scanner/trunk_ids.txt
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Er.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; 2-5 digits.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; group ids are in the range 0x0000 - 0xFFFF
<br>&lt;cider&gt; so selecting the different groups is like using a "host whatever" filter for tcpdump (to stick with the metaphor)
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Although the last four bits are used for status indication, and the pro-94 ignores them by default, so all your groups will be multiples of 16.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, ok
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, that's a good metaphor.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; The scanner is tcpdump.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm, sounds like they're opening downtown up a bit
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; cider: can you show me how this works? he
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; h

<br>&lt;hades&gt; Their website is predictably unhelpful
<br>&lt;cider&gt; not sure - i've done it before, and it wasn't bad
<br>&lt;cider&gt; but i don't remember the rates

<br>&lt;cider&gt; like at your place?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Well. Seattle.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; But he doesn't seem to trust western union.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; And he seems willing to trust the USPS to transfer a cashier's check.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Inconsistencies like that bug the hell out of me.

<br>&lt;hades&gt; The reason he doesn't want to send it with WU is that they charge money to do it.

<br>* hades recommends that he have the person with the cash put it in a box, insure the box for $1500 and send it via UPS or FedEx or someone.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh - yeah

<br>&lt;BR903&gt; None but the dronely.
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; "Even now I am contorted, patting myself on the back."
<br>* BR903 is actually quite impressed with DC1020's sleuthing as well.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; excellent
<br>&lt;cider&gt; doesn't surprise me much.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; though that was very sharp thinking, definitely
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; "Fuckin' DU inetd. Crappy as hell."
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; walking south on pine?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; "is that east or west on pine?"
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; cider
<br>&lt;cider&gt; have you figured out how to program groups of talk groups?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Oh.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; nope
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I know how to do that.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i was trying to follow the docs, but got lost.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; You'e got 10 groups to play with, per set of trunking frequencies.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Or maybe it's 5.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; five groups of ten groups, or something.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; SOmething like that, yeah.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; or five groups of ten ids.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i guess
<br>&lt;hades&gt; 5 sets of 10 sounds right.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; If you hit program and then repeatedly hit the up or down arrow, watch the display to see what changes.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yes. 
<br>&lt;cider&gt; numbers in the top change, and id's change
<br>&lt;hades&gt; There should be an incrementing (or decrementing, I guess) number each time you hit up, and another one which increments ever 10 times you hit it.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; numbers at the bottom change, too
<br>&lt;hades&gt; THe slower one is your group.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; And the faster one is the slot # in that group.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; right.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; sounds like a copter is back
<br>&lt;hades&gt; If you enter ids into slots, you can scan for groups of them by putting the different groups of ids into different ... banks of slots. 
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Terminology gets fuzzy here.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; right
<br>&lt;cider&gt; that's what keeps tripping me up :)
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Then, when you hit scan, press the digits 1-5 to enable or disable scanning for the ids in the bank of ids corresponding to the number you pressed.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ok.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; units double time to 9/pine
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i think i'm getting it.  i wasn't clear on the "scan" thing.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i just had it in "src" mode
<br>&lt;cider&gt; (is that "search"?)
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, src is what I meant.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i keep hearing static for like 20 seconds and then it switches channels/groups/whatever
<br>&lt;cider&gt; actually, i think you want it in scan mode to be able to select different banks of ids
<br>&lt;cider&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "guardian one - we're back with you - we're over the paramount" "oh, thank goodness - received"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm
<br>&lt;cider&gt; another stuck radio
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; anyone know if qfc is open?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i'm betting no, but i wish it was, i want to get food (wanted to get it last night, in fact)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, i need to get some quarters.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i have to do laundry.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; I have shitloads of quarters.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wow
<br>&lt;cider&gt; my monitor can cause static on the scanner
<br>&lt;cider&gt; BR903: really?
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Seriously.
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; I save 'em up.
<br>*** poon (poon [whirlpool] eidolon.muppetlabs.com) has joined channel #foo

<br>&lt;poon&gt; vivace still open, btw
<br>&lt;cider&gt; BR903: i'm gonna go see if qfc is open, but may take you up on that.
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Okay. I'm closer than QFC, though. I have more than I need myself.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, i need to buy some other stuff, too, if they're open, though
<br>&lt;BR903&gt; Gotcha.
<br>* hades has about $50 in quarters, too.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; In a jar in the bedroom.

<br>&lt;kirk&gt; or is that a generic name?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i was just thinking that

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah.  things get crazy the nearer you got to anywhere that sells beer.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, i see
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; oh!  we saw our friend!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; you been out doing recon?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah - we saw "two bit" or whatever
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; tidbit?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; he looked, uh, worn down.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, very
<br>&lt;hades&gt; You know someone named "tidbit"?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; well.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "know" is a funny word.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "yes"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; he was totally hunched over.  kinda sad, actually
<br>* hades shuts up, realizing he knows someone who occasionally goes by "fleshpuppy"
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; we, er, had a minor altercation with mr. tidbit
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wait.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; fleshpuppy sounds familiar.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, claimed silly street name of "two-bit"
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Heh.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; though "tidbit" seems to be more apt.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; flesh puppy was a "lady in waiting" at RHPS cast in the u district.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; our poor little bisexual scamp.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I've seen her in other contexts, tho.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Jacob probably knows her.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, that would explain it.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; that fits - i think i remember her in the context of one of his parties

<br>&lt;kirk&gt; he must not have seen us
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; or that is why he was so hunched over, he didn't want us to notice him
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; hades: so, do you have any priorities set on your scanner?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Not on the trunking one, yet.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, you only get one priority channel per bank
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; ah

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i've seen him wandering around the neighborhood again.  hit me up for a light tonight.

<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah - eric mead - he knows the guy who owns "aurafice" - the new coffee shop on pine
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; right
<br>&lt;cider&gt; the auriface guy was walking home from his coffee shop last night
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; and "of course he does"

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; no way

<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hehe
<br>&lt;cider&gt; he was down near the hi-score at some point last night when gassing started
<br>&lt;cider&gt; so he took shelter with some other folks inside the hi-score
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh, that must have bee rad.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; apparently jim forman came running over and was totally spazzing and telling people to let him in.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; the guy who was running the hi-score decided he was a lame-o and wouldn't let him in.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; so jim forman apparently said "look here, you little bitch!" and tried to push past the guy
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i guess all the KOMO guys were laughing their ass off
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *whoa*
<br>&lt;cider&gt; in the end, poor jim had to go elsewher
<br>&lt;cider&gt; e
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i think they should have let him in, kidnapped him, pierced him, given him some tattoos, dyed his hair, and found him a nice leather daddy.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; lol
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; no kidding.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; there's gotta be a door into rudy's from there.

<br>&lt;cider&gt; (ok, i made up the part about the tanks)
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; just talking about the crowd.  i guess some of these increasingly-tedious protesters are down there now.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ooo
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; free parking dtown saturday & sunday
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; no parking meeters
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; most garages free
<br>&lt;cider&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;cider&gt; that's pretty funny.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're trying to get folks to come back downtown to shop after wto
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeap
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; atf is downtown?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; er
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *the* ATF?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i think that's what they said.  that an ATF unit had detained someone down on alaskan
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i may have misheard - it was a shaky transmission
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; how's the new scanner working out, cider?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; reaper: you know what kind of range the transmissions have that we are listening to?  can we only pick up local channels?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; reaper: good, very cool, actually
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; kirk: you're listening to a repeater on some nearby mountain, but "nearby" in this case means like issaquah, or bremerton.  so, you are hearing stuff from potentially about 30 miles away
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; you might be listening to something on columbia tower, though, i'm not positive
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ooo - they investigating the black-dressed "anarchists"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they trace them to eugene oregan
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oregon, rather.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; reaper: I think the main frequencies in this trunk are from the columbia tower.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; There are some fill in repeaters on a couple mountains, tho.
<br>* hades goes back to watching last night's tv.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Mmm, time-shifting.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; if this helicopter is still in the air at 1 or 2am, i'm seriously thinking of calling in a noise complaint
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; no kidding
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: really?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; (re: anarchists)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; (i was on the phone and not motnirogin)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; how are they not in position to follow that small of a group?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "we only follow really big groups, sorry"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, i lost the d00d's name, but apparently there's an anarchist writer in eugene who...inspires...this group.  forget what they call themselves.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they seem to be short sighted, anti-corporation folks.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; sure, it seems okay to break a window, shut down a starbucks.  but what about the poor fucks who rely on that paycheck and those tips?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they're talking about putting the helicopter on the ground.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; excellent.  there's only a small crowd at pine/boren now.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: i bet it goes something like: "it's their fault for relying on starbucks for that paycheck - they get what they deserve"
<br>&lt;poon&gt; "these men are fools"
<br>* reaper hates that attitude
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh, right.  forgot about that line of reasoning.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; kids these days - don't remeber the recession of the Reagan Years
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; searching on google for anarchist, eugene, and oregon is giving me some info
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; The young anarchists' mentor is John Zerzan, 55, a writer of
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; books and essays who thinks humanity's best hope lies in smashing
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; civilization back to the days of hunters and gatherers.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; erm
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree with you, john.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh. "anarchist squares"
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; http://www.detnews.com/1999/nation/9907/01/07010190.htm
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; it has more interesting bits
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; apparently 15-20 kids meet at his apartment to strategize every monday night
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; thank god they have an apartment to meet in, and not some blustery field...
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.  dominique just got back to me.
<br>* reaper guesses that anyone who really believed that hunter-gatherer crap would be doing something about it rather that writing about it, with a computer, in a heated apartment, making money at it
<br>* reaper feeling extra cynical today
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well, the silly thing about anarchists - if you're pressing your views upon others, then you're no longer really an anarchist.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; imho, anyway.
<br>* reaper hears hams chatting on repeater who might actually be involved in protest/cop clashes
<br>&lt;reaper&gt; deadman: indeed.  i don't know much about anarchists (the real kind) -- any pointers?

<br>&lt;cider&gt; 'night
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well, to finish this movie
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; then sleep

<br>&lt;cider&gt; whatcha watching?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "the haunting".  meant to watch it while i was high on theraflu...wish i were.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; it sucks.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; but it's pretty.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; the HARD_ZONE

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; pr0n banners on overthrow.com?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; supporting the exploitation of women for the benefit of some (presumeably) white d00d is not very anarchistic.
<br>* kirk thinks he hears a drum
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; the anarchy FAQ is actually a good, thorough, informative FAQ
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; it's not?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; it is
<br>* tterb is not familiar with basic anarchy 101
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; "read that"
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; helicopter out of gas
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; it is quite big and presents a lot of quotes in an unbiased way (well, the first N pages, I'm only like 1% through it)
<br>* tterb reads
<br>* cider bets that all the headlines tomorrow talk about what a great job spd did defending downtown today.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; yah
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm, quite a noble concept, why aren't more people anarchists?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; the chopper still flies
<br>&lt;cider&gt; tterb: no stock options in it
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh.  hoo-ray for stock options
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;hades&gt; "red dog barks at the moon. bring citrus fruit."
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; but.. we wouldn't need them
<br>* poon 2 3/4 vested this month
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm.. you can't negate soveriegnty
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; we are all sovereign
<br>&lt;poon&gt; too bad it all ends after y2k
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; eh?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; oh, the market?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; or the world heh
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah, i hope it's okay, and greenspan doesn't jack up interest rates
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; society, the world/universe, the stock market, russia, take your pick
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah.  "one or multiples of the above"
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I do ph33r rioting though.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i don't know what to think.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; there's no herd to follow, so i'm lost
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I figure I have to allow for the possibility of grocery stores being closed for a while
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah.  it's kinda late in the year, but i think i'm going to costco sometime this weekend/next week
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I figure I'm ok for air, water and shelter, I'm just worried about food
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; yeah I'm gonna way stock up on shit
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; maybe order a shitload from grocer.com to my parents house.. heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; lord knows I can only fit like a 3 night supply of foo din this place
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i've got a 3 month supply of twinkies and kool-aid.  i figure i'm set
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; yah
<br>&lt;poon&gt; you need water for kool-aid though
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i'll use my urine
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; i'll be sure to stop by :)
<br>&lt;poon&gt; or a distiller and some sort of semi-potable water
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh.  don't pull an 'alive' on us...
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm, I would guess you can only drink your own urine for so long
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, like 1/3 a millisecond
<br>&lt;poon&gt; wouldn't it be a bit salty or something?  maybe dehydrate you more?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; hee
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; and i imagine you only urinate like 1/2 of what you drink
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; anything useful in it will eventually be gone
<br>* poon has poon [whirlpool] yahoo.com, and gets the most random shit there
<br>&lt;poon&gt; poon is a popular asian name, i've found out
