<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; Subject: STATE OF EMERGENCY ANNOUNCED BY MAJOR SCHELL IN DOWNTOWN AREA  
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; "this is ground control to major schell...."
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; bedtime part II
<br>* CIDR attempting to discover when it will be cool to head downtown.  sounds like they're still gassing semi-heavily down there.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; TT205
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; jesus -- really?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; well, they just deployed at 5/seneca.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; CIDR: jesus
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; you should have seen broadway around 1AM - i went out for a walk - it was emptier than i've ever seen it.
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; TT205, hades - mornin'!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; there were like 2 cars parked along the whole thing, and no pedestrian traffic at all.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; the only other people i saw were the guys screwing plywood onto the windows of broadway market.
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; jeesus
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; TEE2: morning!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; ladders going up conv center from south side
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; *wave*!
<br>* hades goes to watch tv coverage
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; deploying at 4/pike
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; jesus
<br>*** IJ89 has changed the topic on channel #foo to rioting and looting and burning, oh my!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "pike is hostile"
<br>* IJ89 will avoid pike
<br>* wade is not reassured by the smiley talking heads on tv.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; "everything is calm!"
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; wade!
<br>&lt;wade&gt; TEE2!
<br>&lt;wade&gt; i'm pondering the distinction between an arrested protester and a processed protester.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; processing takes place post arrest, i think.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; they arrest you, then process you - which i think means "figure out who you are and take your picture and stuff"
<br>&lt;wade&gt; i think they're processing and then arresting.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; hmm.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; maybe.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; the city reports only 60-ish arrests.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; which would be far less than all those metro busses at sand point.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "a little jar with wires inside of it" seen at 4/union
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; dispatcher pronounces "howell" "how-ell"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; yeah.  metro control does that too
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; huh
<br>*** kirk is now known as KP875
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; KP875
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; CIDR
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; you at work?
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; KP875
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; TT205
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; how was the trip downtown?
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; not bad.  on madison at least
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "nominal"
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; things seem to be pretty normal
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; cool
<br>* CO149 made a point of not using the 5 ave exits from westlake station, though
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; i mean, the bus routes are still messed up, but there is a lot of cars out and traffic seems to be getting through
<br>* wade heads towards downtown.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; wish me luck.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "luck"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "stay frosty!"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; damn fine pic on the front of the PI today of a cop rubber-bulleting a crowd while a tv media dr0k shoots footage in the background
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; nice.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; and a mother with toddler on her shoulders looks on
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; ok, maybe that's not what i'm seeing, but there are certainly some juviniles there
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; morning CO149
<br>* IJ89 wonders if he should take the $200 he's obviously not going to spend on boots and acquire a TT scanner
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; IJ89
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "spend all you want, you'll make more"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; indeed
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; how's the scanner sounding today?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; dunno..i got distracted by "work"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; scanner-like, as far as i can tell.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; bunch of random silliness, but no real mayhem, sounds like.
<br>* poon around
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 8-A can't find his riot stick
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; poon
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; officer henderson's got it.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; it's in his van.
<br>* CO149 tells officer henderson "one cop, one stick"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; poon, where did you score that frequency yesterday?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; henderson, you got the van - now give 8-A his damn riot stick back.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; it's hard to drive and bludgeon at the same time, anyway.
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; truly
<br>&lt;poon&gt; CO149: co-worker.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; he 'found' it.
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; poon!
<br>&lt;poon&gt; TEE2!
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; CO149: for what it's worth, i also heard them talking about using FRS freqs.  i'd be they're being used for non-tactical stuff
<br>&lt;poon&gt; your arrival is anticipated
<br>* CO149 grabs the alinco and starts up the GMRS/FRS bank
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i heard them referring to FRS and "the squat" in the same sentence, so it's prolly the local equivalent of "health and welfare"
<br>* CO149 grabs the T8A and starts scanning down from 470
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; but they have at least one other channel beyond 469.5 and the FRS stuff
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 469.5 is silent today
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; naturally, no freqs were mentioned
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; no, they're on
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i heard 'em this morning, but there's significantly less traffic
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i'll see if he's found anything else of import/use
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; ok, traffic on 469.5
<br>* SW548 around
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; not getting much on FRS, but no surprise.  I'm 1/2 mile away thru a concrete jungle
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; we *must* get an external antenna up for the DCU scanner
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; indeed
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; i had it hooked up to the discone at home which worked pretty well
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, that would be cool
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i was getting good reception in my apt using just my flobbly whip
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i could hear 
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; "comms" and a few mobiles
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; riot squad ready to deploy somewhere south of stewart
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; oh, indeed
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 4/stewart southbound
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; large (and apparently noisy) group
<br>* CO149 wonders if a "Mark 46" is a rubber pellet gun
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; arrest team requested at 5/seneca
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; cop line holding at 6/pike in front of sheraton
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; dumpster fire 5/pine
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; again?
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; dumpster fire #137
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; i never would have thought that the junk in your average dumpster would be so flammable.  maybe they were putting something on it first
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, prolly someone brought a buncha lighter fluid in a hip flask...
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; although the fires burned for quite a while, so it must have been the actual contents
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, i think dumpsters tend to get a lot of paper and stuff in them
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; no fire 5/pine after all
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; just someone in a yellow and orange suit?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; prots calling for withdrawl 6/pine
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; <q>
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; Dear Crazed Protesters  - 
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; For some reason, the Flowpoint people are hesitant to come into the
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; downtown area today.  Perhaps it's the seagulls.  So, surprise surprise,
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; Flowpoint training is cancelled today.  They will be getting back in touch
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; with us to reschedule.  Sorry!
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; marauding and looting,
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; Gilad
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; </q>
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; hehe
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; group of 3 unknowns atop nordstroms.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 3 ppl on top of nordstrom
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; order to disperse, 500 block pike
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; cops masking up
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; gonna be another fun day in downtown
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; prot base op uses words like "traffic" and "full quieting"
<br>* CO149 considers a run to sand point to bust out the protesters
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; prot base op is a ham.  he also used the word "QSY" last night
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; plains clothes infiltrating rhubarb at 6/pine
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; IJ89:  his first name is "john" which slipped
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ah, interesting
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; means nothing, unfortunately.  no indication where any of these peopel are really from
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; indeed
<br>* CO149 wonders where the FCC foxhunters are
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; "not interested"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; heheeh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; it would be interesting to do a bit of hunting ourselves...
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; 470 MHz DFing stuff should be pretty small
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; they're out smoking skunk weed
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; you have that antenna
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; mmmm.  skunk weed
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; so i do.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; we can pull that out and drive along denny
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, that'd actually be quite interesting
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; dunno how selective it really is, though
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; crowd breaks thru at 4/union, damage to patrol vehicles
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; all i have are duckies
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; well, more selective than that, then.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i've got some tinfoil!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; and some string!
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; hey, we've got all we need now!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; can i help?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heheh
<br>* CO149 ducks out for some bubblegum
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; actually, tinfoil might be useful
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; if I hear one more news commentater apologize for Seattle, saying something trite like "we're usually a quiet, latte-sipping community" (which I just heard) - I'm gonna fucking scream.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; man
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; local media generally needs to be shot
<br>* KP875 returns with his latte
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; even KUOW was getting on my nerves with their "live coverage"
<br>* hades semi-monitoring
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; hades: how many 94's did that RS have in stock?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Umm. 4 or 5, I think.
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; how much is something like that?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; $200
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; on sale right now
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; normally $300
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "the package" has a mission this afternoon
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ooh.  "the package"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; chief joiner is working on another plan
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; trojan horse?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; could be
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; air raid?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; er.... "seattlite horse"?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>* CO149 can't wait to see how they get Bill outta the westin
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; is that were he is?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; si
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "with a lot of guys with chevy suburbans and hk's"
<br>* IJ89 still waiting for that one single sniper in the crowd
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heh
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; yeah, it looks like he's already left - they showed a motorcade leaving about 5-min. ago.
<br>* hades is still waiting for the zealot in a cessna packed full of high explosives to crash into the westin.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; why would they be blocking truck traffic to ahrbor island
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; dangerous factory workers there
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "because they're not having much luck blocking stuff downtown?"
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; Clinton is going somewhere near there this morning
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; hades:  and he'll miss and hit the hotel :-)
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; they might explode at any time
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; somewhere at the port o seattle is where he's speaking, I believe
<br>&lt;hades&gt; GOd damn. 209 people listening to my scanner. I feel like a pirate radio operator, or something.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh.  you rock, hades
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; you're legendary!
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; and i can easily imagine that this is the most interesting place to listen to with a scanner right now
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; you find a wall bug?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, ran across the street to QFC and got a decent one for $10.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; All of mine had been,  at one point or another, spliced with new plugs.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; hades:  you're #3 on shoutcast's list
<br>&lt;hades&gt; None of which fit the scanner.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Crap, I'm up to 3?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I was just 4.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>* hades takes a screenshot.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; hades: cool.  glad to hear it was resolved, at least
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; the revolution will not be televised, but it will be rebroadcast by hades
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heh
<br>&lt;hades&gt; *grin*
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt;  indeed
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; westbound spokane st bridge closed
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; there goes west seattle
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; "oh well"
<br>&lt;hades&gt; And my friend with a machine under a desk at the UW, who's providing the bandwidth.
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; when the revolution comes #foo will not be televised
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i would hope not
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; no, but the scrool will be ay /home/chris/typescript
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; our ratings would drop like a stone.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; kinda like the wizard in the wizard of oz.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; people would discover we're just some stumpy, balding dwarf with no real magic powers.
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; or the wizard in Mr. wizard
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; or the wizard in the hobbit
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; hades, do you have a hit log for that?
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; even if things got really interesting, i don't think there is any chance that your shoutcast server is going to beat "Pop 80's", hades
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; black scarbes, in the alley 500 block btw pike and pine
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heh
<br>&lt;hades&gt; No, pop 80's is in for the long haul. I'm just a flash in the pan.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; "psychedelic painted flower van"?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; oh boy
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; whoops.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; law enforcement impersonators..
<br>&lt;hades&gt; "grenade launchers"?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Jeez.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; with grenade launchers.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; or something.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; and riot gear
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that sounds... bad
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; almost as bad as pop 80's music
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; indeed
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; hey!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "arrest team to santa's at 6/pine"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; heheeh
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; santa will know who's naughty and nice!
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; and so will the FBI, undoubtedly conducting interviews at sand point
<br>*** CO149 is now known as |
<br>&lt;|&gt; I'm glad you appreciate the notices.  Sometimes stuff happens before we can
<br>&lt;|&gt; get a transit alert out.  Also, to make sure all personnel in our building
<br>&lt;|&gt; were safe yesterday, they were sent home at 5:00 PM.  So, stick with us, we
<br>&lt;|&gt; are doing our best to get the information to you - so you can *sneak* around
<br>&lt;|&gt; the city :-)
<br>*** | is now known as CO149
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>* CO149 had complained that metro didn't page me when they closed the tunnel
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; dressed like a what??
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; oh.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; in black.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i'd have sworn she said "carrying a crowbar and dressed like a yak"
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yurt!
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; anarchist yelling at bill
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; sounds like they are having radio problems
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; clinton heading to terminal 5 on harbour island, I believe
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; the shoutcast server went down?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; hmmm. yeah, I can't connect.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; back now, kinda
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; buncha folks headed for 4 seasons
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; there was something about ppl walking onto the freeway

<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; wow
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; where's the stats page for that?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; shoutcast.org i think

<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; how can you tell how many people are listening?
<br>* IJ89 -&gt; lunch
<br>&lt;hades&gt; The server has a status page I'm watching, and www.shoutcast.com reports it too.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; ah, i guess i'm not seeing that part.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; AH. got it.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; wow, that's pusing like 2Mb/sec

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; hades, you get another mirror?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; your max went up to 421
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Hot damn.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; One of the other guys who offered a mirror must have come through.
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; HEHEH - everyone has it playing on their speakers here
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; i just took off my headphones and realized it was playing outside too
<br>* CO149 hopes hades is breaking a law :)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;hades&gt; *grin*
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; lotsa non-US folks on #wto
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I probably am.
<br>&lt;TEE2&gt; hehehe

<br>* SW548 too
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; it's harshing on my mellow, like, harshly!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; dude, that's harsh.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Hm.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I'm getting a really bad hum.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yeah, that's basically what i'm getting
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; yeah, that's it for me too
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; so what's going on downtown? is it back to normal yet?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; like somebody plugged in a hairdryer
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; OK, now my mellow is, like, *totally* harshed!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; deadman: nope, not exactly
<br>* CIDR tosses his mellow over onto the HARSH heap w/ SW548's
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; mellow returning slowly, but harshly
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; Clinton just showed up on harbour island
<br>&lt;hades&gt; The hum goes away if I take the scanner outside of my apartment.
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; ...drinking what appears to be tea, but is probably some kind of liquid kryptonite
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "eye of the space needle" cam appears to be showing a picture of pine, right by the mcd's.  looks like a mob.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; ppl being searched near 420 facility
<br>&lt;hades&gt; The hum appears very localized.
<br>* CO149 has no hum on his radio
<br>&lt;hades&gt; If I take the scanner to the other side of the wall, about 3 feet away, it's not there.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; If I take it into the living room, it's faint.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; oy
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; so the "magic dragon" is at 420 broadway.  i was eating there once with ben and some d00d walked up to us and tried to buy pot.  took just a little bit to figure out why.....
<br>&lt;hades&gt; On the porch it's faint, in the driveway it's gone.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; well, turn off the hairdryer
<br>* CO149 dives behind the couch!
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; more nonsense?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; good day to stay at home probably
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; totally
<br>* hades gets uberparanoid.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; <q>
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Is this HUM a normal sound you get from your scanner or is it odd.  The
<br>&lt;hades&gt; reason I ask is I'm curious, It sounds like the jammers we used in the
<br>&lt;hades&gt; military.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; </q>
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; whoa
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; lordy
<br>* CO149 confirms no one is being jammed
<br>* hades goes outside to scout for black helicopters.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hehe
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; boost the signal to the forward emitter, prepare a tachyon pulse, and i'll erect a level four containment field.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; why do that when they can send a friendly FBI agent to just tell you to stop?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; where's the fun in that?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; well, i admit that tachyon pulses are *much* cooler
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.  it's looking almost normal downtown. i'm tempted to go into the office.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; deadman: yeah, i'm heading in soon
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i'm just fearful of getting stuck in something like what happened yesterday.  i want to avoid tear gas as much as possible.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i've been dialed in all day, but need to get at some raptor stuff.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; when you heading out?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; not sure yet.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; probably 15 min or so
<br>* SW548 can confirm that his officemates in the "building only CO149 knows the real name of" AKA the Darth Vader Building were all able to get in w/o a problem and are doing fine
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; deadman:  yeah.  metro closed the tunnel early.  I was downtown after curfew
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cool - i'll go down with ya.  gonna dash through the vats right now....
<br>&lt;hades&gt; So, um. 
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Any ideas what to look for to eliminate this hum?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; CO149: yeah, i *dont* wanna have to deal with that.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; if it would harsh SW548's mellow, then i'll have none of it!
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; anything that uses electricity
<br>* SW548 lifts a bong in deadmans general direction
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; you get the hum on battery power. too?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; raptor?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; is there a cat in the house? i'd look there first.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; tterb: yeah, work stuff i can't do from home
<br>* deadman declines the skunk weed, feeling a need to "stay frosty"
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; top sekrit?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; nah
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>* tterb accepts the skunk weed.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; brb
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; but on my NT box.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; i'm about to head down as well
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; not to amazon though, of course
<br>* SW548 contendedly shares his mellow w/tterb
<br>* hades confirms hum on battery power.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Hum is confined to the interior of my house, more or less.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Step outside the door and it drops off sharply then disappears.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; heater goig?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Nope.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; neighbors playing with the TENS unit?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; The hum was present even with the volume set to 0.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I mean, the hum is evident in the cable itself, as well as the scanner.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Both scanners.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; low hum, 60 Hz?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; or more of a buzz, around 200?
<br>* CO149 has a phone that picks that up
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; sounded higher than 60
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Hm.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; northbound 1/cedar, 200 marchers
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, sounded higher than 60.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; well, can you move the computer to a window? :-)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; no hum now
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Fixed it.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; It was my cordless phone.

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "oh, i'll be careful"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i'd opt for coffee and movies, if that's an option
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; got a sampling of the gas last night.  mmmm.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well, i haven't been in to the office since wednesday.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh.  i half way want to come down and experience it

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; TT205
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; TT205
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; who is the manufacturer (tandy?) of this now legendary nnn-94 scanner that I'm going to go look for?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; I've found a Uniden BC895XLT 300 channel scanner at he 'Zon - wondering how it compares
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; heya all
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; SW548: the one you found is a desktop, and compares pretty well
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; the 94 is a handheld
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; Oh, really?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; the 94 is "walkie talkie" sized
<br>* poon perked up, listening
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; the 895 is the desktop model we have for the DCU stuff, when and if we ever get a streaming server going
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; functionally, i think they're pretty close.  the 895 prolly has a marginally better receiver, and has the computer control stuff in it
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; other than the obvious advantage of being portable - are their big feature differences between the two?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; oh, thanks (I'm still behind, aren't I)
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; aside from computer control, probably not.  maybe the 895 has greater coverage
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i'd have to compare the specs
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; the 94 has 1000 "channels" and hte 895 has 300
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i think they mean "memory locations" when they say channels, though
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; 29Mhz - 965Mhz range for the 895
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i'd compare the two in terms of my desired usage before i compared specs, thoguh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; if i was gonna sit at my desk and listen, i'd get the 895.  if i was gonna walk around or sit on the bus and listen, i'd get the 94
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; if i was going to do both, i'd get the 94, since the 895 isn't even vaguely portable
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; hmmm. who makes the 94?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; if you're curious, bearcat makes a 245, which is portable like the 94.  it's the same price as the 94, and is similarly featured
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; 94 is nominally made by realistic, a tandy/RS company
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; dunno who "really" makes it, though
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; right.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; uniden
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ah
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Uniden
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah.
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; so is the Unien 245xlt handheld comparable to the 94?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; but the bearcat 245 only has 300 channels, and is probably the "portable equivalent" of the 895
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; well, the channel count is different, and the 94 is a newer design
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i dunno what else is different
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; check www.strongsignals.net (or .com, or whatever) -- they have reviews
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, .net
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; the specs I'm looking at for the uniden 245XLT say 300 channels
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; right
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; hades, looks like your mirrors fell off
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; and the 94 has 1000
<br>* CO149 is even considering "upgrading"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; http://www.strongsignals.net/htm/model.htm#SEC11
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; didn't you say that was a different speck?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that sez that the 94 and hte 245 are the same
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; heh - spec
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, the guy who was mirroring them got disconnected and couldn't get back on. Heh.
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; so.  wade and i are in a car with a vendor, heading south on 1st ave.  i look up, and there is a *wall* of people heading toward us, about a block away.  vendor slams on brakes.  wade and i duck out of the car and head for western.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i tend to think that the pro-91 is more closely equivalent of bc245, but that's only a casual observation
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; good job, TT205
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; (! is more like the older 235
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; er
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 91 is
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; really?  ok
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; so, just so I'm clear, the 94 and 245 are the same device, just that one is marketed by Realistic and one directly as Uniden.  Is that correct?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; um.  i dunno if that's correct or not
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i thought it wasn't
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; i expect there are some differences
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; i haven't seen a "uniden" model that's exactly like my "radio shack" model
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that would make sense
<br>* CO149 must get food.  he has a tedious meeting comeing up
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; bbl
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; SW548: i recommend (if you're really interested) checking www.radioshack.com and looking at their prices, pictures, and specs
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; (hit catalog search, telephones and communications, communications, scanners)
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; right.  I'm just checking the Amazon pages on the Uniden right now
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; and uniden prolly has their own page too -- lemme check
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; what's the amazon price on the 245?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; 249.99
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JBRT/qid=944083081/sr=1-6/002-5500752-2129845
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; www.hamradio.com has the 245 for $219

<br>* KP875 receives email from BT alex brown
<br>* IJ89 wonders vaguely if there's any exciting packet activity related to this whole WTO thing
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; the Uniden touts the ability to scan multiple trunks simultaneously - I can't find mention of that feature on the pro-94 - is this useful?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yes
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; if you want to listen to, say, police and fire at the same time.  i know CO149 has complained about this in the past
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; do you know if the pro-94 can do this?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; and some offer the ability to scan both trunk and conventional at the same time -- this is also useful
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i don't know.  lemme poke around the rs site
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; that's where I'm at and I can't find any mention of that feature
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; at a guess, it can't
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; hmmmm.
<br>* IJ89 wonders if CO149 would be interested in selling his "old" scanner for a modest sum
<br>* IJ89 just wants the TT ability, all else is merely icing
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; does the fact that it's referred to as a "dual-trunking scanner" indicate this feature?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that most likely indicates that it can listen to two trunks at once
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; which is the same feature we've been talking about, right?
<br>* CIDR MONITORING
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; CIDR
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i assume that it's significant that the 245 is selling for around $220, and that the 94 is selling for $300 normally
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; CIDR
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; SW548
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; i just got the 'we got your paperwork' email
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; well, two trunks at once != trunk + conventional
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; CIDR
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; TT205
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; right - which was an unknown feature of the Uniden.  
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; ooh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; debating scanners?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; what's the basic skinny?  i think i gotta get me one.
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; but the 2-at-once feature was what I was trying to determine
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; trying to discern the differences/benefits of a pro-94 vs. Uniden 245
<br>* IJ89 sees that the 245 does indeed have computer control
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; CIDR: i just got it, so your's is probably coming soon
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; http://www.uniden.com/docs/product/prdetail.cfm?product=BC245XLT
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; IJ89: computer control is *not* a feature of the pro-94, correct?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; as far as i kknow, correct
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; the radio shack page is a little light in the spec/feature description dept.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Hey, does anyone have winamp running at the moment?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; I do
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Could you check and see if http://www.elsewhere.org:8080/ is a working shoutcast stream of the scanner?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; it's buffering
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; SW548:i'm trying to find more info on the PRO-94
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; you bet so!  
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Sweet, thanks.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; (pro-94 has no compter control, correct)
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; is that worth the $40 difference, do you guy's think?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; http://www.strongsignals.net/htm/pro-94.htm
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i wouldn't pay for it.  unless you want to leave it at home and control it remotely
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; remember that the 94 *normally* sells for $300, it's just on sale now (and probably not worth much more than about $250)
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; while the 245 normally sells for between 220 and 250
<br>*** deadman is now known as DC1020
<br>* DC1020 MONITORING
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; and it may be worth finding someone who can let you handle either scanner, and see if the operation is even vaguely intuitive for you.  i find that matters a bunch more than numeric specs once i actually own a device
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; right - I'm just trying to figure out what the differences are.  I'm new to all this, so I'm easily mired down in what might seem to be irrelevent details...
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, it is easy to get lost in meaningless minutae
<br>* DC1020 gets his stuff from unamerican.com
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; (including the "i guess i was punk once" tshirt and the "sinner" tshirt)
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; strangely appropriate
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; In your wisened opinion, then, IJ89 - the pro-94 is a better scanner than the 245 (I know, I know)?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; hmm
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i would say, having never seen either of them, "yes"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i say this mostly because it's newer, has more channels, and is likely a "better" design due to its more recent production date
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; things like the receiver will be better.  the ergonomics will be totally up to you -- i'd seriously go to radio shack and play with one for a few minutes.  if you can't figure out how to change bands, look through a few channels, and do some other stuff...
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; it may be more trouble than it's worth.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; you *can* find local retailers of both scanners in seattle (dunno about PT), and they're so close in features that usability might well win the race
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i know that CO149's pro-91 was slightly baffling to me when i played with it, so the bearcat might be easier to use
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; thanks so much for indulging me - I just need a little hand-holding before diving in
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; as far as receiving signals out in PT, we can get you hooked up with a hefty antenna and a preamp if necessary
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; nae prob.  always looking for more radio converts... <sly grin>
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; and, i'm always happy to talk radio.  i really like it...
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; wouldn't I want a desktop model, though, if the radio/pre-amp contraptions proved necessary?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; not necessarily.  those could be hooked into the handheld as easily, and then you could take it to seattle with y ou when you went
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; (and we could stick in marine channels and the like for the ferry crossing...)
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; OK - I'm off to run errands w/the fiance - *may* return w/a scanner....
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; if you do decide for a desktop model, you're gonna have to plant it somewhere, but you'll probably get a better/easier to use radio
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; excellent.  good luck
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; (and certainly, if you hook it up to a computer, you can get it *really* easy to use)
<br>* IJ89 finds a good review of the 245
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; http://www.strongsignals.net/htm/rev245.htm
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; it *can* scan both trunk and conventional at the same time, and two trunks at once, looks like
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; what's that mean, really?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; (to a dumbass like me)
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; it means you can listen to the cops and metro at the same time (while scanning)
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; so what's "trunk" and "conventional"?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; or listen to cops and fire at the same time (since they use different "trunks")
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; trunk is when you have a data channel, and N voice channels.  *every* trunk transciever talks to the data channel to figure out where to go, then you have a conversation on "your" channel (as determined by the trunk controller)
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; this way you can have 1000 peopel sharing 8 voice channels
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; "conventional" is where the cops get 851.5 MHz, and the fire dept gets 851.7 MHz, and that's all ya get
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ie, where there's no interactive retuning
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; basically, under normal circumstances, trunking means you can get many more users into a slice of spectrum than with conventional
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; but under emergency/high traffic situations, it means that trunk users get screwed (i can't talk!) and conventional users are better off
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; so "trunking" is why you can only hear one side of a conversation in a taxi?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; all these dep'ts like trunk because they can fit lots more users in their allocated channels
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; uh, that's probably duplex, where the taxi transmits on channel A and listens on channel B
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; hmm.  ok.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; trunk, once you have your channel, is simplex -- everyone uses channel A for talking and listening
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; or, more likely, the taxi was in range of you, and whoever he was talking to wasn't 
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; so you can hear the controller, and not the taxi (the usual case)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; well, what i meant was sometimes you'll hear the dispatcher in a taxi say "hey, cab 413, where the hell are you?" and then some silence and then "ok, well, go the hell over to &lt;address&gt; and pick this guy up."  
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; oh, and trunking is a repeating system, if i've got it right -- everyone talks through a repeater
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; and presumably cab 413 is talking back during the silence.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that's just when you can't hear 413 ;'cause he's 10 miles away
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; ah.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; and in that case, the taxis aren't using a repeater -- they depend on their car's signal reaching all the way back to the base.  and they don't normally need to talk to each other, just to base, so that works
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; cops have to talk to each other, sometimes across distance, using only a handheld radio -- the repeater means that they can do that
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; right
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; the repeater is stuck up on a mountain, with a really good re3ceiver, so it can hear everyone.  then it repeats it all back so everone can hear everyone
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; so trunking is basically like a switch - it controls who can talk when
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; exactly
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; so what is trunk tracking?  seems like if everyone is using the same frequency, couldn't you just listen to that?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; in fact, a trunk system is almost precisely like a switch, except that the switch ports aren't wired to be the same -- it'd be like a dynamic switch
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; well, it switches if you're quiet for more than 2 seconds, or something
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; so, you can listen to one conversation on one channel, but it might switch out in a second or two
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; the idea behind tracking the trunk is that your receiver can follow the conversation by listening for the talk group -- which is the serial number/ID number that sez who you want to talk to
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; so what exactly is a channel, in relation to a frequency?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; so the trunk controller sez "your ID is 10, and you wanna talk to another 10 -- go to channel A"
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; a channel is about 12.5 kHz of spectrum
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; which is really about 5 kHz of signal and some buffer so you don't run over your neighbor
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; so you have 851.1875 as channel A, 851.4125 as channel B, 851.9375 as channel C, etc.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; (real freqs, bogus channel designators, i'm sure)
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; how big are these scanners?
<br>* CO149 INOGTMINOR
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; about 3" wide by about 5-7" tall by perhaps 1" thick
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; er.  more like 2" wide, i guess
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; hmm, cool
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; 2.5(W) x 1.75(D) x 6(H) inches
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that's for the 245
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; wow, that's thick
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; CO149: you spot any mistakes yet?
<br>* IJ89 probably made a few trunking blunders
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; lemme check the scrool...
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; i might be interested in something i can fit in my jacket and plug some headphones into
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; KP875: for the 94 (rjl20's scanner): 2.6"(W) x 6.3"(H) x 1.75"(D) 
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, CO149 does that with his 91
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; and the 94 has a headphone jack and runs off batteries?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yes
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yup.
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; hades.  dude.
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; rad, i might just have to stop at radio shack tonight. heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Can run off nicad batteries and recharge off a wall wart while you're using it.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; IJ89:  your discussion is essentially correct
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Kinda cool.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; stop at one far away or call first.  most people are outta them
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; CO149: excellent.  glad to see i have a basic understanding...
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heh, i bet
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Except I have NiMH rechrgeable batteries.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; oooh.  hades is 'leet
<br>&lt;hades&gt; TT205, heya.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; think of a trunking system like a dhcp system.  a talkgroup "leases" a frequency.  after 30-60 secs of no activity the lease expires
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ah, a good analogy
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; but most of the city and county gov't get by on 25 voice channels
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; there's about 8000 radios
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; is that what it is?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; that's kinda scary
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; metro still uses their own uhf system for dispatching and control, but two of their channels are simulcast on the trunk so the off-duty cops can access it
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; KP875
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; IJ89: just read scrollback re: channels - thanks, i think i get it
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; sure
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; er.  whcih bit about channels?  as related to freqs?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ah, ok
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; well, all of it :)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; my manager stopped by, so i had to go undercover briefly.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; cool.  glad i could increase the general knowledge quotient of #foo
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; part 90 of the fcc rulez has lots of good geeky charts and tables
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Ouch.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; My UW server has been asked to stop the scannercast.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; SPD contacted the UW and was not happy.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; UW contacted MBT lead, who contacted my friend.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; d'oh!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; wow
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; ah shit
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; jesus fuck.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; (what's MBT?)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; that sucks.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; so, how were you getting the bits to UW?
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; i was expecting that to happen yesterday, actually, after i found out the url was public
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, i'm kinda shocked it was available for so long
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; if spd thinks that no one else is listening, they're mistaken
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; they're probably trying to cut down where they can.  lame
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; there didn't really seem to be much going on - kinda weird that they waited so long to get upset.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; probably only now had time to worry about it
<br>* CO149 is certain prots have a trunktracker.  I could hear their base putting out the info as I typed it
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; ah
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; tterb
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I was pushing the bits to the UW out my cablemodem at 8k/sec.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Which he amplified about 256 times.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; hey, CO149, do you know how the pro-90 compares to your 91?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I'm putting up an icecast server for y'all, if you want to keep listening.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; what's an icecast server?
<br>* IJ89 still looking for linux *cast servers
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; tterb: weird
<br>&lt;hades&gt; icecast.org; it's linux shoutcast.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Well. OpenSource shoutcast, anyway.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ooooh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i will investigate
<br>*** spud (mikeh [whirlpool] eidolon.muppetlabs.com) has joined channel #foo
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; pnds
<br>&lt;poon&gt; this cusk
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh
<br>* IJ89 tries compiling icecast on aether
<br>&lt;hades&gt; See if http://www.elsewhere.org:8088/ works for you.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I _think_ I'm streaming to it.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Uneventful, tho.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yep, i got it there.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; thanks!
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Cool.
<br>* IJ89 successfully builds icecast on aether
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i'm glad the secret service doesn't want to interview me.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; they don
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; 't?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; bastards.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; well, not as far as i know.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; i'm listening to some anti-cop punk rock.  could folks continue updating #foo as necessary?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i think it's pretty slow right now
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; DC1020: yeah, i'll update - but nothing's really happening.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; hades: fyi, the phone hum seems to be back
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; gone now
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; rock-throwing on virginia
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Heh.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Crap. 
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I was on the phone in the kitchen.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Guess I'll have to use the regular phone.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; well, it wasn't as bad that time as it was before, for what it's worth.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Cool.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; you have a 900 MHz phone, hades?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yup.

<br>&lt;spud&gt; Ya, it's a great read, I can see why it won an award.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; NOw you just need a scanner hooked up to that fucker.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; prots dispatch 911 to 1/pine
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; does it have a sound card?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; this scanner needs a 1/8 mono plug
<br>&lt;spud&gt; No!  We'll be forced to loot a Radio Shack!
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Well, I suppose we could just buy one.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; damn.  i *so* hate being derivative
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; lol
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; "african embassy"?
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; what does that mean?
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; you know, the country of africa
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; i guess there was confussion as to whether they had diplomatic immunity or not.  guess they don't.  so they can't break the traffic laws.  heh.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; and they don't have a placard, either.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; all olympic command units masking up.  woo.

<br>&lt;CO149&gt; will someone please tell the copz that 1st runs N/S by convention?
<br>* IJ89 gets asked, "so, are you an undercover cop, or what?" in the PCC line, due to his squawking radio
<br>* IJ89 sez, "no"
<br>&lt;spud&gt; So did you guys follow the cops when they skipped frequencies last night?
<br>&lt;spud&gt; I heard 'em say stuff like "move to: COMMAND-1" or shit like that.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; when did that happen?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; gas at pike place mkt 
<br>&lt;spud&gt; This was around 11:00pm last night.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; ah
<br>* IJ89 was safely watching boob toob then
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; these refer to various talk groups
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Ah, I figured with last night probably being the most interesting night to own a scanner in recent memory.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; gas 1/pine
<br>* IJ89 heard the prot base report prots sitting at 1/pike or so
<br>* IJ89 has no trunktracker
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Ahhh.  Didn't realize.  CO149 has that 3733t gear.
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; spud: i would have been glued to the damned scanner, if i had one
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; yeah, and RJL20.  just not me <sob>
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; 1,2,3,4 aves closed northbound at seneca
<br>* SW548 back and in possesion of a PRO-94
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; woohoo
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; excellent.  did you try it out first?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; (and *no* fucking idea how to use it)
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; "read the manual"
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; SW548:  stand by for programming data
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Press buttons randomly.  Try to look intelligent.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; (works for me)
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;spud&gt; So CO149, have you heard any feds talking on yer scanner?  Or just SPD?  
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; those vat-grown ones just don't cut it
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; spud:  feds not on the trunking system
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; SW548: fucking useless, they are.  glad you found one, though
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; although i guess they use 410-420 MHz
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; better than the second dude, who clearly didn't know *anything*, started pretending he did just to close the sale.
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; CO149: thanks for the data - that ought to keep me busy for a while!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; wow
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; that was fucked
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; just watched a huge skirmish right in front of the office out the window
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Who was fighting?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; cops and miscellaneous
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "cops won"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Ya, they're better equiped.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; it was pretty chaotic - there was a lot of street traffic, which was pretty crazy
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; yeah, the gassing and police movement outside appears to be wholly random
<br>* IJ89 thinking he should look into 245's, since he wants to try his hand at programming a computer interface
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; how do they differentiate between "protesters" and "folks who work/live/beg downtown"?
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; DC1020: they differentiate?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; DC1020: the non-protestors are being referred to by the local media as the "normal people" (I'm not making this up)
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; good god.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; folks headed into the 99 tunnel?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; this manual says that you were breaking the law, CO149, when you "intentionally" (heh) listened to pager transmissions...
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "anarchists running northbound, 6/pine"
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; this section ends with: "We encourage responsible, legal scanner use."
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; sure they do
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; TV just picked up dude smoking some skunk weed in the crowd
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; "we encourage any scanner use that makes us $200
<br>* DC1020 notes that he is currently sitting at his desk
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; was it tterb?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; IJ89: they specifically mention that it is manufactured to specifically avoid picking up illegal freqs and that you should *not* open it up and try and modify it
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; SW548: i doubt it would benefit you at all to do it -- all the blocking stuff is in software, you'd have to burn a new EPROM to get it to modify its behavior
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; Oh, I wasn't thinking of trying to do it - I just found it somewhat odd that they went out of the way to tell you explicitly what *not* to do...
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; "do not remove the pin from the firing mechanism of your machine gun, as that would make it fully automatic and illegal."
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; sounds like there's random lunacy at the market

<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; to say the least
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; yeah, the cops were standing in rows in the street outside our building
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yeah.  we've got teargas seeping into our building at the moment.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "so there!"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; Mayor Schell just extended the curfew another night
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; goodie.
<br>* KP875 walked *through* tear gas last night
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; so *there*
<br>* CIDR walked through *more*
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; so *THERE*!
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; "did not!"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>* TT205 huffing tear gas cuz she *likes* it!
<br>* KP875 cracks open a tear gas grenade and drinks it
<br>* IJ89 walks slowly away from You People
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; ok, it sounds like they're basically just chasing people around at random.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; "good plan"
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; this is *not* "confuse-a-cat"
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; dammit.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; hm.  travis on the phone with another crazed CS rep
<br>&lt;spud&gt; You got quite a snootfull of that shit last night didn't ya Kirk?
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; heh, well, it was pretty intense for about 30 seconds before we got off broadway
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; gas to 2/pike
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; gunshots at the market 
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; *snrk*
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; fuuuuck
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; not gunshots, apparently, just concussion grenades
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; oh.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yeah.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; those have been going off for a while.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; tunnel closes 7pm

<br>&lt;KP875&gt; i wonder if i can catch a 70-something up to the u district before then
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; highly likely
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; cool.  i'll see if that radio shack has that scanner.  what was the model again?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; PRO-94
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; "ask for it by name" 
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; point out that it was in a recent flyer
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; make them check their computer
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; heh
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; shake them vigorously
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; add salt
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; i'd call first -- hades said he couldn't find one until 185th/aurora
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; and tell them my number is 555-1212?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; *exactly*
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; well, i kinda feel like going up there anyways
<br>&lt;IJ89&gt; just sayin'
<br>* IJ89 decides that icecast and liveice have confused him enough for today, and it's time to head out
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; KP875
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; CIDR
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; you wanna grab me one if they've got 'em? 
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; i already own a scanner, otherwise i'd get one, too.  heh.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; there's a growing cloud of teargas directly in front of my office, so i don't really wanna hit the streets just yet, myself.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; though this one *is* portable.
<br>&lt;KP875&gt; sure, if they have two (i suspect they won't have any)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; yeah, me too
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i just saw the cops shove some guy off a payphone he was using
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; he was dressed in a suit with a briefcase, so i doubt very much that he was a demonstrator.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; jesus fuck.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; the mayor is gonna have *so much* explaining to do.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i think right now is probably just a VERY_BAD_TIME to be outdoors in the pike/pine corridor.

<br>&lt;SW548&gt; I'm getting something on 453.400 - any idea what that is (talk of 'tactical' and 'detectives', etc.)
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; i think that's fire dispatch
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; hmmmm.
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; that may have changed, though
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; actually, I think it might be Oak Harbour police
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; it sounds like a drug bust
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; it's a freq from the pre-trunking era that they still use for simulcast 
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; ah, damn.  there goes yer skunk weed supply, SW548.
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; "I'll give you a visual ID on my unmarked detective..."
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; they're gonna start screaming around the city with lights and sirens

<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; the wsp's appear to be confussed.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; er, confused.
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; I seem to be getting Metro dispatch on 453.375 - would that be right?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; yes
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; i have a metro band plan if you want it
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; pretty good to get that out hear, I'd think
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; totally
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; you plug in the trunk freqs yet?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; "don't apologize, you think you're confused?  I'm probably more confused than anybody!"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; you hear that on metro?
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; CO149: haven't got that far yet - I'm just playing w/limit scans
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; press with cred may have gas masks
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; (for the rest of us, there's  $500 fine)
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; CIDR: yes
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; to wear a gas mask?
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; metro is cool to listen to
<br>&lt;CO149&gt; all help desk managers should listen to that
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; it's sparse, but it's interesting when I get something

<br>&lt;SW548&gt; still figuring out how to use the squelch properly when scanning

<br>&lt;SW548&gt; think you are still you
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; heh.  after the theraflu, no.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; DC1020 had all his atoms split in 1/2 by extended theraflu exposure.
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; shit, theraflu would turn your hair white
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; yup.  just like that old star trek episode.  now i'm the bitter, evil DC1020.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; the happy, good DC1020 is no-doubt getting hassled.

<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; yeah, they've been trying to change their image.  inspired by the simpsons episode.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; "hot stuff, coming through!"
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; this on channel 5, right now - idiots are editorializing about shit they know nothing about
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; isn't that kinda what this whole thing has been about, mostly?  (on both sides, probably)
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; we're getting CS pepper gas coming our way right now - we may be in danger... - SHUT UP!
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; *yes*
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; "in danger"
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; feh
<br>&lt;SW548&gt; "CS pepper gas"
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; it's not mustard gas, ferchrissake
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Wow, getting a cab might be tough.

<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; well, amzn has priority

<br>&lt;spud&gt; Not too bad.
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; so.  can cars get through on first?
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; i mean, if wade and i had someone come pick us up?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; they're starting a "big ball of energy"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; TT205: probably.  they're getting through on 2nd, i think.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i can go take a look.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; (out the window)
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Any word on the protester activity in belltown's crack park?
<br>&lt;TT205&gt; hmmm.
<br>&lt;spud&gt; Or was MA203 smoking a bit of the rock himself?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; i think he was just hoping to get some skunk weed.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; how are they determining when to use lights-only and when to use sirens and lights?
<br>&lt;spud&gt; "heads"
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; heh
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; looking for witness/victims of rock/bottle throwing from teh garage.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; and a city council person wasn't let past a line 'cause their car didn't have proper wto placards.  they're apparently unhappy.

<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; and we were wanting to host the olympics?
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; wtf is 187 in the po-po?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; it's gangsta for killing an undercover cop.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; why's that 'officer safety info'?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; probably because someone is running around saying they're gonna kill a cop.
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; but it's probably just a freak spouting bullshit.
<br>&lt;DC1020&gt; what's a "po-po"?
<br>&lt;CIDR&gt; a cop.

<br>&lt;cider&gt; police squads called to broadway and pine to "cover our backs as we move north"
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; "That?  It's a flesh wound"
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; sounds like a fine time to live on the hill
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; think i just heard a bang
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: me too
<br>&lt;cider&gt; and the copter is back.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; so, cider and I will both be owners of PRO-94 (or was it 95?) scanners tomorrow.  someone is driving from the u dist radio shack to pick them up tonight so i'll pick them up tomorrow
<br>&lt;cider&gt; where are they driving them to?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; from some store way north to the u district store
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, cool
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; woah heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; kewl
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; how much are they?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; $199
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; the non-protesters are just getting in the way
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; everyone equates them with the demonstrators and writes them off
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; heh.  of whom?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; 12 ninjas gonna ambush officers at bway/olive
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; wow, they actually said "ninjas"
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; getting in the way of real protesters
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yep
<br>* deadman monitoring
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; they did?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; deadman
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman
<br>&lt;cider&gt; see any ninjas?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; another bang
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; over from pine and bway
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; no ninja
<br>&lt;cider&gt; another bang.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; just outside my apt.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; how can they be ninjas?  if she saw them, she'd already be dead
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; grrr.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;delores&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: maybe the dispatcher's a ninja, too
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; ah, that explains it
<br>* spiff believes that
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i think the instant-death effect can be countered by other ninja
<br>&lt;cider&gt; whoa
<br>&lt;cider&gt; louder bang.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; boom
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; jeez, lots of bangs
<br>&lt;cider&gt; *really* loud bang
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>* kirk checks outside his door
<br>&lt;delores&gt; cider -- you at home?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yep
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; hey, send some action up here.
<br>&lt;delores&gt; jesus.
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; when to they get loogie guns
<br>* aquinas back from dinner
<br>&lt;delores&gt; aquinas
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; time to ponder this strange and wonderful device
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; delores
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; 'morning
<br>* spiff eating his fav dinner.  little chunky sirloin soup burgerlets on ritz crackers
<br>* cider brb
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; aquinas, what was that scanner resource site IJ89 gave you>
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; ?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; www.strongsignals.net
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; cool, thanks
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; it was/is quite useful for a rookie, at least
<br>* spiff drops some things into www.muppetlabs.com/~chris/scanner
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; thanks, man
<br>* aquinas accessing
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; does the pro-94 receive anything below 29 MHz?
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; it might go down to 24Mhz - lemme check
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; no, it bottom's out at 29 Mhz
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; 'swhat i suspected.
<br>*** Signoff: poolgirl (Leaving)
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; ?
<br>*** poolgirl (tee [whirlpool] eidolon.muppetlabs.com) has joined channel #foo
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; hi all!
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; apparently not
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; Hi poolgirl!
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; hi!
<br>* spiff passes poolgirl a tiger-striped kevlar vest
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; thanks!
<br>* spiff got stuck with the mauve one...
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; well ... "it happens"
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; i just have to show up sooner so i can have the electric blue one
<br>&lt;poolgirl&gt; definitely
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; man, this thing has to be the most non-intuitive piece of technology I've ever tried to use
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; yeah...it's kinda weird
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; gas and rubber bullets at broadway/republican
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; man with bottle fluid in it, broadway/john
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; better than a bottle with man fluid in it, I tell ya
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; indeed
<br>&lt;cider&gt; jesus chirst!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; this is *insane*!
<br>* cider MONITORING with reaper in tow
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; yo
<br>&lt;cider&gt; the cops and apparently soon to be natl guard are basically chasing the residents of cap hill around.
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; cider, reaper
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; wtf were you doing outside?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "standing outside my apartment"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "getting flashbangs thrown at me"
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; apparently
<br>&lt;cider&gt; and trying to ask cops if there is a curfew on cap hill.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they didn't feel like chatting, though.
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; if men in masks with molotovs don't tell you, then the fact vivace is closed should be good enough
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i didn't see any men with molotovs.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i saw a bunch of people coming out of their apartments.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; and a bunch of cops chasing them.
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; "bottles with fluid" have copz FREAKED
<br>&lt;cider&gt; and some poor woman who needed a jumpstart but couldn't get anyone to stop.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; so i went and got my car and gave her a start.
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; you jump her?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; er.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "so to speak"
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; excellent
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; cider
<br>&lt;cider&gt; howdy.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; jeez
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; um
<br>* spiff hears bangs
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; "undesirables"
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; obviously went to WSU
<br>* kirk wonders if that is actual undesirables or just people standing outside their apartment
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wow
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they're being chased straight down my street.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; fucking hell
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; and here i've been a good little american and have been watching tv.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; jeez, i come back in and hear an explosion
<br>* spiff adds a goodly number of scanner channel frequencies muppetlabs.com/~chris/scanner
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; .msg reaper includes the alinco's channels
<br>* spiff gonna go sit with the HTS
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; keep yer heads down
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh, roger
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; so i'm wondering if i should poke my head outside or not.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; sounds like a 'no'.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; jesus.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; i was thinking about it
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; sounds like a fucking warzone out there
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, crazy
<br>* kirk gets off phone with parents
<br>&lt;cider&gt; did they call you?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i figured they would call, so i called.  they weren't watching the tv, or watching a movie, i guess
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, heheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *fuck*
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *badness* outside my apt.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're breakign shit.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; dunno what.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; shouting.  bangs.  explosions
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; another one.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; kinkos?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; si
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; are you over kinko's deadman?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; si
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; doh!
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; kinkos is the man!
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; and freaking "demonstrators" running and shouting "no more police state"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; fucking chicken and egg problem, that.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; this is driving me nuts.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i wants the fucking cops out of hear.  and the fucking demonstrators
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, it sucks to see 100 residents yell "where should we go, we live here?" and then a guy toss a firecracker at the cops
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; jeez, CPR
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I take it vivace is still closed?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh, i'd bet on it
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, deadman and i saw casey making a run for it.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; shee-it
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; FUCK
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; teargas outside my balcony
<br>&lt;cider&gt; officer gonzales is unaccounted for.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; booting to windows so i can use the sound card.   brb
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; is the feed back up somewhere?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; http://www.elsewhere.org:8088/
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; I get 'error connecting to host' when I try that (like I have since it was shut down)
<br>* deadman back
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; aquinas: hit that url with a browser and see what the "Click _here_ to listen!" url gives you
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; hmmmm.  OK
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; i suppose there are multiple freqs
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *very* little radio traffic on this freq
<br>&lt;aquinas&gt; that worked - why for it wouldn't work straight up as a url in winamp?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; dunno
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; is this server no longer being published on shoutcast.com?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; the police told them to turn it off
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; oh really heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; does he have bandwidth?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; well, i think it is behind a cable modem
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; ahh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; the ip address is owned by: Meridian Partners (NETBLK-WORLDSNET2) WORLDSNET207.159.128.0 - 207.159.159.255
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; ah, the traceroute goes through headbone-gw.lightrealm.net 
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; meridian partners?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; oh heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; hmm, is someone giving that address away? :)
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; 9/50 listeners
<br>&lt;cider&gt; anyone know what's going on on cap hill these days?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I, uh, told someone else about it.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; 911 for the CD (central district, i assume)
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; that is a very vague order
<br>* wade MONITORING
<br>&lt;wade&gt; if anyone feels like vacating the hill, you're welcome at my place in ballard.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; this is fucked!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i think most of the hill ruckus is dealt with
<br>&lt;cider&gt; possibly not
<br>&lt;wade&gt; good to hear.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; lemme know.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; looks like traffic on bway again.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; lack of local media coverage of the bway stuff was telling
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; imho
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hostile crowds still reported at bway/pine
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I saw good coverage of the broadway shit
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; but there may have been an overall lack of it
<br>&lt;wade&gt; sorry. just heard that bit about 15th and madison.  in the direction of delores' place.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, motorcycle accident.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; okie
<br>* deadman suddenly realizes that q-patrol was not to be seen this evening
<br>&lt;wade&gt; heh
<br>&lt;wade&gt; "what a shocker"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, i think that was "us" tonight, deadman.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i'm sure they would have liked our little friend
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; no kidding
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well, q-patrol was put together partly 'cause cops wouldn't respond to queer bashings, and 'cause homos were afraid of cops
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; just got me thinking 'cause of the "hostile towards police" crowd at pine/bway
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; yeah..
<br>&lt;wade&gt; deadman: how are things at your location right now?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; wow, they are telling the police to stay away from pine/bway, esp. in patrol cars
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I wonder what "violent" and "hostile towards police" rreally means
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; must be a lot of people, or they are trying to calm things down
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; wade: quiet, it seems.  gonna go out to the porch and check....
<br>&lt;wade&gt; cool.  really good to hear.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; i just lost hades' scanner feed.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, me too
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ditto
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i didn't
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i'm kinda thinking that seattle is gonna have a kinda gnarly PR problem on its hands for a few weeks.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well, obviously hades likes you best of all
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; obviously
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm, still can't hear anything.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; nor i.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; looks like normal foot traffic.  and street traffic.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i'm surprised that there hasn't been any electronic "demonstration"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; attempts to re-open url failing
<br>&lt;cider&gt; taking out websites, and such
<br>&lt;wade&gt; i read something about an 'electronic sit-in' on the wto servers.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; huh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, slashdot had a link a day or two ago
<br>&lt;wade&gt; right.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; another standoff, moving up...pine
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; towards the precint.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; neato
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; jim forman saying the cops trying to keep things under control
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; fucker
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; such bullshit
<br>&lt;cider&gt; what the fuck is out of control??
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; no kidding
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; and what i've seen does not lead me to believe that the cops were trying to "keep control"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; well.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; and jim forman reporting that "broadway was cleared" like that's a *good* thing.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i guess to be fair - they're trying to control things - but not things that need controlling by cops
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; indeed.
<br>* deadman holds his knee down.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; as far as i could tell, they were trying to control people who were walking home.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; exactly.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; which doesn't make a great deal of sense to me.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; 'class action law suit'?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; where?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; or are you suggesting one?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;wade&gt; i dunno.  that phrase just popped into my head.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, yeah
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;wade&gt; tear gassing and clubbing rush hour commuters down town sounds like grounds for one.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; naw, more like nasty editorial letters
<br>&lt;cider&gt; maybe we could have a protest.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; (d'oh!)
<br>&lt;wade&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; okay, i finally lost hades' server
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh no! seattle's "clean and green" reputation tarnished!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i can connect, but i'm not getting any data
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: this on TV?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; damn it, I was going to buy beanie babies today too
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; nw cable news
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; damn those protesters!
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; fucking slade gorton
<br>&lt;wade&gt; what has skelator got to say?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; that seattle is a pansy city, basically.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; too accepting
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ("too accepting" - his words)
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; cider: i'm eating up about 56kbps on 'Pop 80s', tell me if you need it back
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: nah :)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;wade&gt; gee.  i guess we need to just invoke a 'zero-tolerance policy' regarding accepting things.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; that should clear things rightup.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; apbonline has got some stuff on their scanner feed, but not much
<br>&lt;cider&gt; (it's realaudio)
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; metro schedule back to normal tomorrow, except for pike/pine routes
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; freaking helicopter overhead again.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yep
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "still"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; looks like it's circling the folks on pine.  over by the qfc/oddfellows hall
<br>&lt;cider&gt; how many people are over there, would you say?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; completely unknown
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yea! nordstroms will be open normal hours tomorrow!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ya-hoo
<br>&lt;cider&gt; cops are wondering why there are firetrucks at 8/virginia
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; seattle placed 8th as best mannered city in the us
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; portland was 9th
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "not any more"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; oh, nice
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; uh, i thought there was a curfew on the whole pike/pine corridor until midnight friday
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; someplace in south carolina got first.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: really?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i thought so, i'll have to go back to the page...
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; http://www.cityofseattle.net/news/detail.asp?ID=613
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: thanks
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; delegates and people essential to business can enter, nobody else.  dunno who is going to shop...
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; what was that?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; whoa
<br>&lt;cider&gt; what the fuck?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; unknown checking
<br>&lt;cider&gt; that was a whole bunch of shit exploding
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; came from the direction of the demonstration.  traffic on bway looks normal.  that's all i can make out.  the helicopter is still circling, but the light's off.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; on - on tv.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; teargas.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i can still hear stuff blowing up.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; right by the qfc
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; it's on tv.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; damnit!!!!
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; star trek isn't on!!!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; fuck fucking digital cable!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "what is happening to our city?" sez talking media head.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i want local channels
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i really don't see how surrounding people and deploying gas is the best way to calm the situation
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i think it's about a show of force and "not backing down"
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; it contains a sedating agent
<br>&lt;wade&gt; ?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; d00d giving commentary is right on.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; oh yeah?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i think he's gay.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; had a bit of the accent.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; talking about how peaceful this neighborhood is, normally.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; "the accent"
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; what channel?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; 2
<br>&lt;cider&gt; so, if the news is telling people to go shopping tomorrow, and the cops tell all the people to go away, that could be interesting.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; nw cable news.
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; nw cable news blowz goatz
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, the nordstroms thing was reported on ch7
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah it does.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ch5 all over again
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i mean, they think protesters are bad??  wait until some QA househusband can't get near pacific place with his chargecard!
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; looting broadway/e pike
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; 2?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; but this troy thomas guy has a decent perspective
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; "that doesn't come in real well"
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; cable 2
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hehe
<br>* tterb was jk
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; sounnds like a nice little siege at east precinct
<br>* cider gonna see if CNBC is rebroadcasting anything like they were last night
<br>&lt;cider&gt; spiff: oh yeah?
<br>&lt;spiff&gt; yeah, 12/pine
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; troy is saying that it's very easy to mistake residents of the neighborhood with demonstrators
<br>* cider really wishes he was getting some kind of fucking useful media right now
<br>&lt;cider&gt; scanner or tv, whatever
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hell, FM or AM would suffice
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; protestors are shouting "go home" to the natl guard.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; and cops
<br>&lt;cider&gt; oh boy
<br>* spiff -- bed.  scanner -- recharge.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; 'night, spiff.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; 'night, spiff
<br>*** poon (poon [whirlpool] eidolon.muppetlabs.com) has joined channel #foo
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; poon
<br>&lt;cider&gt; poon
<br>&lt;cider&gt; 'sup?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; out with spiff...in with poon
<br>&lt;poon&gt; not much
<br>&lt;poon&gt; got tear gas'ed earlier
<br>&lt;poon&gt; stupidly, went to eat on broadway
<br>&lt;poon&gt; is the police scanner up again?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heard any more bombs/crowds/gas recently?
<br>* poon can only hear/see the chopper from this vantage
<br>&lt;poon&gt; this is all stupid
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; all over.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; sheesh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; poon: yeah, shit's all over
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; the cloud of tear gas by the qfc is *quite* thick.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; what are the non-cops (are they protestors?  rioters?  demonstrators?  whatever) doing?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; are they holding their ground?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; deadman: that's where i was; the little indian joint across the street.  things were calm when we went in, and tear gas'y when we came out
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; can't see.  cops are staying their ground.
<br>* poon couldn't make out rioters from onlookers
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cloud blowing my way.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; sheesh.  that bit of coverage on ch13 was enlightening.

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;poon&gt; ooohh..
<br>&lt;wade&gt; cap hill denizens threaten to occupy east precinct.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; there is a very very large number of riot police around 12th
<br>&lt;poon&gt; 'go figure'
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; troy's getting gassed.  heh.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; whoa
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; line of people at pine/broadway.  holding their ground.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; man.  this could get seriously ugly.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; troy's driving around in the nwcn van.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; (like, way more than it is already)
<br>&lt;poon&gt; any of you get gassed in your apt yet?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yep
<br>&lt;poon&gt; the city should send us all amazon gift certificates to make up for this
<br>&lt;cider&gt; and i think deadman has, too
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; troy sez "police are standing their ground", then "people are standing and watching"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; more blasts.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; did you see the quick interviews with the delegates that king5/kiro had?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; troy sez cap hill is "familiar" to him.  heheheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "i'm sure"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; nope, i don't get any local channels for some stupid reason
<br>&lt;cider&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;wade&gt; hah
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh.  northwest cable news?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; poon: naw, didn't see that.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; poon: yeah.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i'm trying to find out if i get nwcn
<br>&lt;poon&gt; the delegates said they were sort of baffled that clinton seemed to side with the protesters
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; folks in gas masks throw gas canisters back at the cops
<br>&lt;wade&gt; where?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i wonder what's happening with the WTO talks.  that's not getting any coverage, is it?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; 12th/pine
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i thought it was cool that clinton distinguised between violent and non-violent protesters
<br>&lt;poon&gt; the most i've heard about the talks is "the talks finish friday"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; there's a conference in town?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh.  yeah, some TWO thing
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i think it has something to do with the steel workers' union
<br>&lt;wade&gt; naw, apples or something like that.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cops moving west
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; to 11th
<br>&lt;wade&gt; or french cheese.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; back from 12?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; si.  forcing folks back down pine
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i saw the police chief saying the cops didn't push the protesters/rioters up into capitol hill
<br>* poon hears bangs near his home'

<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, i can hear 'em too, and i'm way down the other end of broadway
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i'm two blocks north of pine
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; and bway
<br>* wade re-extends his offer: spend the night in quiet ballard.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; quiet?  then we'd miss all the fun
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; tempting, but me and the cat are gonna stick it out.  
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i wonder when that helicopter is going to refuel
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; even now she sharpens her claws on the couch.  in protest.
<br>* kirk prepares a kitty teargas grenade
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "gregory" of cap hill talking on nwcn

<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "big clouds of chemical warfare agents"
<br>* tterb argues with people on efnet
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "only bothering residents"
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Oh, yay!
<br>&lt;hades&gt; The cops didn't shut my friend down.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; hades!
<br>&lt;hades&gt; They just called the UW to make sure the UW hadn't been hacked.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; UW administration overreacted and insisted it be shut down.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; jeez
<br>&lt;hades&gt; wade, heya :)
<br>&lt;poon&gt; tterb: where, about what?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; gregory sez demonstrators merely an inconvenience.  cops are terrifying
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; that's mostly a good point

<br>* hades sets up a public shoutcast reflector account.
<br>* cider notes that apbonline's feed kinda stinks
<br>&lt;poon&gt; hades: is the feed back up somewhere?  elsewhere:8088 was just white noise last i checked
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ooh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; it's back now
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; elsewhere seems to be back up for me
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I had to reboot; winamp had crashed hard.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; it earned it.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; indeed
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yay
<br>&lt;poon&gt; hades, you're going to get huge kudos from this
<br>&lt;hades&gt; *grin*

<br>* hades hops over to check out efnet
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; this is vaguely surreal
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh yeah, this d00d got opped then started kicking people he disagreed with
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: to say the fucking least
<br>* kirk too
<br>&lt;cider&gt; what's up?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; vaguely?  you've been doing too many drugs
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wtf?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; she's plugged in to a lot of web-based and possibly foreign media
<br>&lt;cider&gt; protestors trying to steal gas from a gas station somewhere
<br>&lt;cider&gt; report of armed robbery @ 2/bell
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: interesting
<br>&lt;cider&gt; how the hell'd she end up in your house?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, she's using my phone now to call her family
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Ok, scanner switching addresses.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; sorry
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; she chose my name at random
<br>&lt;hades&gt; http://216.32.166.87:8448
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; 'cause it was 'coffin'
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hades: got it
<br>&lt;cider&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;cider&gt; right on 
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; she was with a council member

<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; your name will take you places some day, my son
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I love going on random irc as BM593
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, i generally take my nic handle cause i know it should be unique
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; looks like the cop push stopped
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; "should be:
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: yeah, sounds like they pushed back to 12th
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; just heard that.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; big crowd still at bway/pike
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; what little I saw of the news made out some sort of standoff at the precinct
<br>&lt;cider&gt; bway texaco and chevron shut off gas pumps
<br>&lt;cider&gt; (is everyone getting the feed, or should i keep updating?)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; 150 protestors headed for precinct w/ dumpster
<br>* poon getting feed
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i just started getting it again.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; okay, i'm getting it again
<br>&lt;wade&gt; we got it here.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh, "headed for precinct w/ dumpster"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i'll shut up, then
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: yeah
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; you mean APC
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i dunno, it's kinda nice to have an echo
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i can scroll back
<br>&lt;poon&gt; :)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: heheh
<br>* tterb about to get it
<br>&lt;cider&gt; poon: true :)
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; got it
<br>&lt;cider&gt; tterb: oh, thought you had it, sorry - wasn't ignoring you
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh, nod
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I don't pay attention half the time anyway, so..
<br>&lt;poon&gt; bring the what up? apc??
<br>&lt;cider&gt; poon: yeah, i think so
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; we could transcribe it on another channel
<br>&lt;poon&gt; it would be neat to have a full radio transcription from the riots
<br>&lt;poon&gt; wish we could have recorded all this
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;cider&gt; too bad we don't have a couple hundred TB of disk 
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh
<br>&lt;wade&gt; peacekeeper?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, a little truck with badasses on it
<br>&lt;cider&gt; it's more like a platform with a motor and some railings
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they were crusing around downtown in one earlier
<br>&lt;poon&gt; we need to setup live cams next time
<br>* poon really joking
<br>&lt;wade&gt; i'm all for it!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh.  not really looking too forward to 'next time'
<br>&lt;cider&gt; we actually wouldn't have needed *that* much disk to record 8kb/sec for three days :)
<br>&lt;poon&gt; though i *do* want to get downtown with my digital cam sometime
<br>&lt;poon&gt; cider: yeah, that's what i was thinking.  disks cheap, could setup a fat raid and record most of the show
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wouldn't even really need a badass raid - 8k/sec is pretty easy to stream
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, it ends up being not too much.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I captured several hours of it.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i mean to stripe the disks.  i wonder how much space it'd actually take though
<br>&lt;wade&gt; hades, you RAWK!
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; ya
<br>&lt;cider&gt; poon: 86400 * 3 * 8kb
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i think just a big (20gig) disk and a periodic burn to CD
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah, not bad at all
<br>&lt;poon&gt; dang
<br>&lt;wade&gt; anyone see anything on local tv right now?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; not me
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm, server dropped me
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, back.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; ditto
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; brb - escorting the press
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; where to?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; verify a what?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; oh, warrant.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; what's at 12th and madison?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; not a lot
<br>&lt;poon&gt; heh.  eh.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; that's pretty far south
<br>&lt;wade&gt; near la panzanella and 4 angles
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;poon&gt; "protesters at IHOP.  they appear to be eating".  heh.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; driving a whole van full of what?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; officers
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; s/angles/angels/
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "hmm, not done yet - add more cops"
<br>&lt;poon&gt; hehe... "just about right"
<br>&lt;poon&gt; did mayhem go on all night last night?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i don't think so
<br>&lt;cider&gt; at least, not serious mayhem
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; going to the chevron station
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: that's a little bit insane
<br>* poon hears sirens
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;poon&gt; well, literally, and figuratively
<br>&lt;cider&gt; poon: where are you?
<br>&lt;wade&gt; deadman: stay home.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; 17th, between john and denny
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, 'k
<br>&lt;cider&gt; (just keeping score on who can hear what where)
<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah - didn't you move from the diane apts?  wher eyou?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; nope, still @ diane
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i'm #1, kirk is #2 
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;poon&gt; ah.  good vantage for this i would guess
<br>&lt;cider&gt; well, can't see anything, but i can hear stuff occasionally
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i was thinking about something cool a while back.  it was related to some other stuff, but i was thinking it would be cool to have a huge database recording all these little facts (assuming voice->text would work...)
<br>&lt;poon&gt; this feed isn't still on batteries is it?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hades got a wall bug, i think
<br>&lt;poon&gt; er.. wait.  the server went kaplewy last night didn't it?
<br>* poon keeps forgetting what happened.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; not exactly
<br>&lt;hades&gt; www.elsewhere.org:8080 is relaying from the live365 feed
<br>&lt;hades&gt; (Got a wall wart, yeah.)
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hades: not picking up anything from elsewhere yet
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; me either, just "ICY 200 OK"

<br>&lt;poon&gt; yeah, where at?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; east side of broadway around pine, i think
<br>&lt;cider&gt; the "aparatus"?
<br>&lt;wade&gt; 'the hoses'?
<br>* tterb wonders if it is safe to go for milk
<br>&lt;cider&gt; probably gonna firehose 'em
<br>&lt;cider&gt; tterb: where?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i think most stuff is pretty well closed
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; qfc heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; the one on bway is closed
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; fuckness
<br>&lt;poon&gt; safeway on 15th is shut too
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; what about the safeway on bway?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; i would guess qfc, too, but i dunno
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; and the harvard qfc?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; dunno - imagine they're closed, too - but i dunno 
<br>&lt;cider&gt; harvard qfc is where all this shit is going down
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; yeah, true
<br>&lt;poon&gt; "see cops, throw rocks"
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; eh?
<br>&lt;poon&gt; just something a friend of mine says.
<br>&lt;poon&gt; a humorous ism
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "how's it look for a 931"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; (that apparently means "can we go eat now?")
<br>&lt;cider&gt; whoa
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; "going for guns"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; eh?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; 931 is going for guns?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; folks are calling 911 and telling them that they're going to go get their guns and come back.
<br>* tterb blinks
<br>&lt;cider&gt; tterb: no, 931 is cop-speak for eating - so "how's it look for a 931" means "can we go eat now?"
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm, who's telling who to get guns?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; it is not clear who is calling 911 and who is getting the guns, and if they are the same people
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>* tterb lost the feed
<br>&lt;cider&gt; tterb: randoms seem to be calling 911 and making threats
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; nice
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i can't imagine there are more than 5 people out there that a) have a gun and b) are close enough to home to go get it

<br>&lt;wade&gt; redhat 5.2
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hades: you looking for more reflectors?
<br>&lt;wade&gt; i called kiro to ask why they didn't have i live feed.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; they said their staff was too sleepy.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wtf ever.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Well, I'm trying to get the unix shoutcast server to work, and atlantis keeps giving me "unable to resolve yp.shoutcast.com" errors.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Which is bogus, and I suspect library problem.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; is atlantis recent rh?
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Nope. It's slackware 3.0, I think.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; hades:  what is your phone number?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah
<br>&lt;poon&gt; acn you stick yp.shoutcast.com in the hosts file to hack aroun dit?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; you looking for recent rh?

<br>&lt;wade&gt; neither am i.
<br>* cider wishes he could get some local channels or nwcn
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; demonstrators possibly getting rowdy
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: sounds like they're starting to fortify a little bit
<br>&lt;cider&gt; and it's raining
<br>&lt;cider&gt; spock must be the helicopter
<br>&lt;wade&gt; responses varied between a lack of man power to a lack of importance.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wha
<br>&lt;cider&gt; t??
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; did you press them on the lack of importance point at all?  be interesting to hear what they mean by that.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; at least 20 minutes before any cop action due to snafu with vehicle
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; looting starbucks very important.  possibly spraying rubber bullets into a crowd of dumb kids not important
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; would that be "the aparatus"?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; no idea
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they haven't talked about "the aparatus" lately.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; hearing jim forman say "flash-bang" is funny
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: where are you hearing it?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; rtsp://www.apbnews.com/scanner.rm
<br>&lt;wade&gt; cider: <q>i'd hardly call it a protest or riot, sir.</q>
<br>&lt;cider&gt; deadman: what was the cop deployment like when you were out there?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; wade: goddamn.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; kirk: oh, huh - they were just picking up some other boring cop stuff earlier
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cider: pretty strong
<br>&lt;hades&gt; I think the helicopter is "guardian one". Maybe spock is one of the apcs?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; whoops, wondering what the problem with the aparatus is
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they're gonna hose 'em - trying to get in touch with the fire dept
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hades: could be
<br>&lt;cider&gt; it's definitely a vehicle - they were requesting a spot light on the alley from it
<br>* BR903 MOTORING IN
<br>&lt;cider&gt; BR903
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; what's the aparatus?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; tterb: unknown
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; must have something to do with the mass arrest contingency plan
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; natl guard 15 to 20 min away
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; jim forman getting philisophical
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah, it's a "fire aparatus"
<br>&lt;wade&gt; fire apparatus
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh, yeah
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; (re: jim forman)
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; kirk: you catching this?
<br>&lt;wade&gt; drones, meet kathy...
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah, at 80kbps real video
<br>*** wade is now known as kathy
<br>&lt;cider&gt; howdy, kathy
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; hi kathy
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; kirk: right on.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hiya kathy
<br>&lt;kathy&gt; hi
<br>* deadman slicks back his hair and squirts binacca into his maw
<br>&lt;kathy&gt; bout time
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; according to THE_INTERNET a "fire aparatus" is a bigass hose pump
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; okay, dead air
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; what are you guys listening to?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; ooh, phone calls
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh, someone from bellingham calling
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heheh
<br>* cider gonna try to get the video feed
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; with family members who are cops in the riot control squads
<br>&lt;cider&gt; realplayer is looking for other ways to connect to the internet.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; she's upset at the protesters and all the anti-cop calls
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm, i think my realplayer hates me.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; wanna watch it here?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; sure, 'sec - gonna finish configuring this nameserver at work first :)
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; which feed?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; this is actually pretty good coverage, relatively speaking
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; rtsp://www.apbnews.com/scanner.rm
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, most of the viewer calls are throw-away, unfortuneately
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; wtf is rtsp?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; real time streaming protocol
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; real time streaming protoocl
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; rtsp is wtf?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ehh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; (which i happen to be porting a proxy for at work :)
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; is it a real protocol?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; much smaller looking crowd of people
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ah
<br>&lt;cider&gt; fire aparatus, in fact, seems to be a standard ladder truck.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; but that can't be right - it wouldn't take them 20 min to get one
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; silly developer didn't check that he couldn't log in.  heh.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; weird.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, there's a fire station *right there*
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well, two blocks up, but still....
<br>&lt;cider&gt; whoa. 
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; fuck, I can't watch it either
<br>&lt;cider&gt; found a classified ads page that sells used firetruck equipment
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; enumclaw?  god
<br>* delores MOTNIROGIN
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.  folks not in seattle seem to side with the cops.  folks in seattle side with demonstrators.  seattle is obviously much too permissive.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; i love how this guy has to recap things
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm.. any alternate formats?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; delores
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; is there just an ra stream, or is it only rv?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; just rv, apparently
<br>&lt;cider&gt; man climbing monorail at 5/battery
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.  just like stallone did.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; jeez, sending in more  people
<br>&lt;cider&gt; more cop people?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; er, guard
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; national, that is.
<br>&lt;delores&gt; cider, kirk, deadman
<br>&lt;delores&gt; so.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; delores
<br>&lt;delores&gt; there's this helicopter that's been hovering near my house for some time now.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, these are the same cops who took an entire day to deal with a single man with a sword.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; delores: it's circling over 12th/pine.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; police stand off with demonstrators/residents
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; is it clear what's happening?
<br>* tterb wonders where he can find some milk
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; milk is a tool of the devil
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; used to make me sick.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;delores&gt; deadman: jeez.  thanks for the update.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah - five hour standoff
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; er, guard taking a serious stance
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cops just arrested somebody
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; the cops have masked up
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; we've lost jim forman!
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; signal just died.  i think something came unplugged
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; stiil dead air
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; creepy
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; we still have a signal
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; back
<br>*** kathy is now known as wade
<br>&lt;wade&gt; we lost hade's scanner link.  what was it again?
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; jim forman describing capitol hill
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah that was a hoot
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; someone from juno calling
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm, what channel is that on?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; 2
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; oh heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; so any word on open stores in the hill area?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; unknown
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i'm thinking qfc may be open.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; nothing happening down there.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; yeah, I heard it was closed
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I might check in a bit
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well then.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yer screwed.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; at least the walk would do me good if nothing else
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; call 'em.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;wade&gt; tterb:  co-op?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; co-op in wrong part of town.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; wade: no thanks
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;wade&gt; oops!
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; boo hoo
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; apparently, they are motnirogin, but not open
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh, yeah, i'm not that worried about it
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; naw, that was in response to something on tv.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; yeah, i've gone "boo hoo" a lot over the last few days
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; another arrest
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; concussion grenades
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "good morning"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; wish i had a feed....
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; er, scanner feed.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; police moving towards broadway
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; tear gas
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; a maskless cop got gassed
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; many more concussion grenades
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; Thu Dec  2 01:50:24 PST 1999
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; woo
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.  they waited for the rain to start before they did that.  interesting.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; another wad of riot cops.  banging their shields
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cops have assumed position at 11th/pine
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; crow spread
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; er, crowd
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; pine/bway now filled with cop cars.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; whoa
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; apparently the cops were asked to take a single step back as a show of good faith, and the majority of the demonstrators would have disperesed.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; but the cops said now.  this is what the county councilmember is reporting.  his word: "asinine"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; er, cops so "no"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; said no
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; jeez.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; must sleep
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ah
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i see the apparatus
<br>&lt;wade&gt; did this precede push down pine?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah - the councilman was getting some leadership formed out of the crowd.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; he was the d00d in the suit
<br>&lt;wade&gt; leave it to the cops to do it the smart way
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; he managed to do it, was getting folks to move up to the sidewalks.  but they wanted the cops to take a step back.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cops refused.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; councilman saying some very unkind things about the cops.  heh.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; Kathy joins the councilman in saying unkind words
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.  indeed.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; what councilman?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh, this on 2?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; si
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; there was a county councilman and 3 city councilfolk down there.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; I heard some booms earlier
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; concussion grenades.  followed by tear gas.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; woah heh
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; damn
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm well I'm gonna go see if I can find an open business
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; now is a bad time, d00d
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; but good luck.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; 2am -> wade & kathy sleep
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; 'night.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; true enough
<br>* tterb reconsiders
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're trying to figure out where the crowd ran off to.
<br>&lt;wade&gt; thanks for sharing the facts with us non-cable subscribers!
<br>* wade out
<br>* tterb still motnirogin and interested in what is going on
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they're talking to some d00d calling in from califronia
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; he's been watching the coverage on the internet
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; gonna poke my head outside real quick....
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; the copter's circling pine and bway
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; some folks appeared to be leaving the area.  looks like very little street traffic
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; though it is ten after two.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>* hades grows sleepy.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; "streetsweepers, return to staton 25"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; very...very...sleepy.....
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; so - news is reporting that it's "over"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; though the copter still circles.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Copter's trying to figure out where the crowd went, prolly.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Make sure they don't regroup.
<br>* hades is glad he lives in BFE.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; what sort of converage is there on the net?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; unknown
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Huh. Where's .th? I appear to have an .au listener and a .th listener on my scanner.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; just nwcn reboardcast
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; the internet coverage the guy was watching was the same thing cyrus and kirk were watching.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; er, rebroadcast
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; thailand
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Cool.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; TH: Thailand
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; /exec -out country th
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; ooh, cool
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; CX: Christmas Island
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; for example
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Nifty.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; BE: Belgium
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, i think the array is missing a couple of new top levels, but i only ever encountered that once.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; /bin/sh: to: command not found
<br>&lt;cider&gt; er
<br>&lt;cider&gt; TO: Tonga
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yay!
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; here's a nic eheadling
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; headline
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; "seattle protestors wrong"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; cops seem to be heading homewardish
<br>&lt;cider&gt; tterb: where'd you see that?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; http://www.afr.com.au/content/991202/update/update50.html
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, the australian wto delegate was fuming mad over the protesters and the way the cops coddled them.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; "coddled"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; well, my word.  but that was his basic idea.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "we would never have allowed this to get so out of hand in australia"
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "because nothing very interesting ever happens in australia"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; totally
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; www.amazoningsiding.com
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; er
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; www.amazingsiding.com
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; fingers too programmed.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; *snrk*
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; www.800-657-4100.com
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; that url is too weird. i gotta look....
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.  no name service.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; where are you getting this stuff?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ads from the tv.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; ahhh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; copter light just flashed into my apt.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; damn, it's bright.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; did you throw some teargas at it?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; naw, fresh out.  the cat's been snorting it all day.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Heh. Council member aide asks SPD if they know where the councilmembers went.
<br>* cider has a theory that the two people who got arrested out of the crowd before the teargas came were cops
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Yeah, there was talk of plainclothes cops in the crowds this morning.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; call me paranoid.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; yeah, i heard that.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; d00d - i *totally* suspect that's the case.  
<br>* hades goes to bed.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; G'nite, all.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; 'night, hades.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; 'night
<br>* hades -- zonk
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i must sleep too
<br>* cider too soon
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; though i'm a bit nervous about what i might find waiting for me tomorrow.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; okay - i'm gonna go to bed and try not to listen to the copter
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; it's gone.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; that's cool.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; it's back.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; woo
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i'll no doubt be dreaming that i'm in beruit
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; or bellevue square.  with the tear gas and a big stick.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>* kirk still watching nwcn
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, me too
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh, they finally started cutting people off
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; turned down the sound though
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; oh?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, just not that interested in the perspective of folks from spokane.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "go fig"
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; well, some guy called in and said "my dad's up there".  the reporter said "uh, okay"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; too funny
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; (as a policeman)
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; he went on to name some friends that were policeman and how it was wrong, she said "thanks for your call"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; they should have a second line for crackpots
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; but yeah, i think they cut the phone in segment when all they got was people from outside the city with relatives who are policemen
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, those cops were all from that precinct.  or most of 'em, i'd guess.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; man, i don't think i'd ever seen or heard him before, but jim forman is a total knob.
<br>&lt;kirk&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; yeah, they normally send him to sites where whether is occuring
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heheheh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heavy snow? send jim! rain? jim!
<br>&lt;cider&gt; they ought to send him to the bottom of puget sound on an extended aquatic life exploration mission.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; last week he was reporting on the heavy rain and flooding from snoqualmie falls.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; or just give him one of those paper "chinese fingercuff" things.  probably take him *months* to get it off.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; HEH
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; beautiful image.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i hear a siren in the distance.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.  this italian delegate lives in seattle.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; huh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; interesting.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; he said he felt that most of the prots were from out of town.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; *whoa*
<br>&lt;cider&gt; hmm?
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cnn newsource ge-3 trnasponder 9 87 deg west long tech 404 827 1094 editorial 404 827 2659
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; and a color bar
<br>&lt;cider&gt; er
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; now it's back to normal
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; that was weird.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; i think that qualifies as "technical difficulties"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; totally.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; small time outfit, anyway.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.  i wonder what their on-air "availability" stacks-up to be.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; hm.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; heheh
<br>&lt;cider&gt; "how many nine's you guys getting?"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; ah - it's quiet outside.  only hear the rain, now.
<br>&lt;cider&gt; about freakin' time.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; i'm oot

<br>&lt;tterb&gt; you guys calculate your availability, right?
<br>* tterb back from milk hunting
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; "never"
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; we don't have to
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; true
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm slashdot is down
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; cnet does that for us.
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; anyone read the story there?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; cnet?
<br>&lt;cider&gt; nope
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; is there a url for that?
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; heh
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; slashdot? gave up on reading that awhile back.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; heh.
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; (i've reached maximal "linux is the be-all-end-all" news ingestion)
<br>&lt;deadman&gt; k - really out now.
<br>* deadman -&gt; zzzzz
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; yeah, i don't really read that much
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; but i'm interested in that article
<br>&lt;tterb&gt; hmm I think someone filtered port 80 accidentally
<br>* tterb attempts bed
<br>* tterb back for a moment
<br>&lt;hades&gt; Fucking power outages.
<br>&lt;hades&gt; *mutter*
<br>* hades goes back to bed.
