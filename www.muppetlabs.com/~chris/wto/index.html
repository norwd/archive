 On 30 November 1999, the World Trade Organization attempted to hold
 a ministerial conference in Seattle.  Somehow unbeknownst to law
 enforcement officials who were not smart enough to read the alternative
 press or posters on walls, several thousand people showed up to protest.
 <p>
 Safe in a bunker in the Belltown area, and in possession of radios and
 scanners, several Muppetlabs Drones gathered together on IRC to share
 information in real time.
 <p>
 These are the transcripts of three days of protest reporting along with
 any side comments and other conversation.  The transcripts are edited
 only to remove non-disclosable information of certain drones' employers.
