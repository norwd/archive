 <p>
 We've all done arithmetic.  In the supermarket when providing for
 our families.  On the highway when comparing our speed with the posted
 limits.  (We may not necessarilty care if we are exceeding the limit,
 of course, but it's always interesting to know by how much.)  And in the
 restaurant when determining how much of a tip to leave on the table,
 or whether or not we'll have to do the dishes to pay for the meal.
 Arithmetic, verily mathematics as a whole, is always around us, from
 the most mundane tasks to the most embarrasing and profound situations.
 <p>
 With some minor exceptions, we perform our arithmetic operations
 in base 10.  But is base 10 really the best way to do arithmetic?
 Are calcualtions easier to perform in some other base, say 12 or 16?
 Let us take a brief look at someof the inherent advantages and
 disadvantages of the use of alternate number bases in arithmetic,
 starting with our tried and true friend, base 10.
 <p>
 The primary advantage that base 10 gives us is that we're accustomed
 to it.  The most popular explanation is that we have 10 fingers on
 our hands.  We are able to match our fingers to up to ten of some other
 object.  Counting the number of times we can do this before we run out
 of whatever we were counting allows us to use numbers greater than ten.
 Some cultures, for similar reasons, have used number systems of 5 and 20.
 (Base 20 by calling the toes into play.) [<a href="old_base12.html#notes">1</a>]
 There are some disadvantages that are immediately apparent in bases
 5 and 20.  Base 5, for instance, is a fairly small base, requiring
 more units of measurement.  (Which is easier to work with, one hand
 and three fingers, or eight fingers?)  Base 20, on the other hand
 (forgive the pun) disadvantages itself in the fact that not many of
 us can bend our toes independently of the others.  Peoples in colder
 climes may have to remove shoes of moccasins to do any such counting.
 For whatever the reason, base 10 seems to have predominated.
 <p>
 This was not always the case, and in any group can be found some
 oddballs.  The Babylonians used a base 60 system of enumeration,
 although for numbers less than 60 a base 10 notation was used. [<a
 href="old_base12.html#notes">2</a>]  Some Northern European societies had a quantity
 known as a "great hundred" made up of 10 dozen or 120, reflecting
 the rudiments of a base 12 counting system. [<a href="old_base12.html#notes">3</a>]
 The Romans, even though they used base 10 for their integer counting,
 had a system of duodecimal, or base 12, fractions.  It is thought they
 chose this because of easy divisibility in so many different ways.
 [<a href="old_base12.html#notes">4</a>]
 <p>
 Again, base 10 has lasted through the years, and is still going strong.
 However, there is something that is gaining attention for non-decimal
 enumerating:  the computer.
 <p>
 Computers use, at their lowest levels of operation, the concept that
 an 'on' condition can be assigned a different numerical value than a
 corresponding 'off' condition.  This leads us to a binary, or base 2,
 system of numeration.  This is all well and good for computers, but
 for humans it can be a bit cumbersome.  For example:
 <p>
 <center>
  842<font size=-1>(10)</font> = 1101001010<font size=-1>(2)</font>
 </center>
 <p>
 As you can see, relatively small numbers in base 10 produce some
 real monster-sized binary numbers.  We clever humans, therefore, have
 developed some convenient shortcuts.  These shortcuts are created by
 converting binary numbers into octal (base 8) or hexadecimal (base 16)
 numbers.  This is actually quite easy.  Taking our example from above:
 <p>
 <center>
  1101001010<font size=-1>(2)</font>
 </center>
 <p>
 we divide the number up three places at a time from the right, thus
 <p>
 <center>
  1 101 001 010
 </center>
 <p>
 and convert each group of three into single octal digits:
 <p>
 <center>
  <table border=0 cellspacing=5>
   <tr>
    <td align=right>1</td>
    <td align=right>101</td>
    <td align=right>001</td>
    <td align=right>010</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align=right>1</td>
    <td align=right>5</td>
    <td align=right>1</td>
    <td align=right>2</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </center>
 <p>
 just by finding the decimal values that correspond to each place.
 Therefore,
 <p>
 <center>
  842<font size=-1>(10)</font> = 1512<font size=-1>(8)</font>
 </center>
 <p>
 Converting binary into hexadecimal is similar; start by dividing the
 number into four digit groups:
 <p>
 <center>
  11 0100 1010
 </center>
 <p>
 and insert the appropriate values:
 <p>
 <center>
  <table border=0 cellspacing=5>
   <tr>
    <td align=right>11</td>
    <td align=right>0100</td>
    <td align=right>1010</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align=right>3</td>
    <td align=right>4</td>
    <td align=right>10</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </center>
 <p>
 This leads to a bit of a problem, in that '10' in and of itself is not
 a single digit.  In the computer industry, therefore, it has become
 customary to represent the values 10 through 15 by the letters A
 through F, A equalling 10, B equalling 11, etc.  Our conversion from
 above then becomes:

 <p>
 <center>
  <table border=0 cellspacing=5>
   <tr>
    <td align=right>11</td>
    <td align=right>0100</td>
    <td align=right>1010</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align=right>3</td>
    <td align=right>4</td>
    <td align=right>A</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </center>
 <p>
 meaning that
 <p>
 <center>
  842<font size=-1>(10)</font> = 34A<font size=-1>(16)</font>
 </center>
 <p>

 Now that we have seen some of the rationale for the use of some
 of these number bases, let us try to compare them mathematically.
 To recapitulate, the bases we are comparing are:
 <p>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>The "Finger" Bases:  10, 5, 20 <li>The Binary Bases:  2, 8, 16
  <li>Bases 60 and 12
 </ol>
 <p>
 One fine way of comapring number bases is to compare some of their
 divisibility indicators.  (A divisibility indicator would be the fact
 that, in base 10, all numbers divisible by 5 end in 0 or 5.)  Other ways
 include tests to help identify prime numbers and perfect squares.
 [<a href="old_base12.html#notes">5</a>]  Let us take a quick look at the divisibility
 rules first.  Only the really "easy" rules will be listed for each base,
 and we will concentrate only on divisibility by numbers less than the
 base number itself.

 In some bases, identifying prime numbers and perfect squares is trivial,
 in others more difficult.  The best way is to see how many different
 digits each of these numbers end in, compared to the size of the base.
 A table showing which digits apply to each type of number follow.
 <p>
 <center>
  <table border=2>
   <tr><th>Base</th><th>Prime Number End Digits</th><th>%</th><th>Perfect Square End Digits</th> <th>%</th></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>2</td><td>1</td><td align=center>100</td><td>0, 1</td><td align=center>100</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>5</td><td>0, 1, 2, 3, 4</td><td align=center>200</td><td>0, 1, 4</td><td align=center>60</td></tr>

   <tr><td align=center>12</td><td>1, 5, 7, 11</td><td align=center>66</td><td>0, 1, 4, 9</td><td align=center>33</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>16</td><td>1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15</td><td align=center>80</td><td>0, 1, 4, 9,</td><td align=center>25</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>20</td><td>1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19</td><td align=center>80</td><td>0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16</td><td align=center>30</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>60</td><td>1, 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 59</td><td align=center>57</td><td>0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 21, 24, 25, 36, 40, 45, 49</td><td align=center>20</td></tr>
  </table>
 </center>
 <font size=-1>
  Notes on the table:  the columns marked % refer to the percentage of
  digits which appear against the given base.  The percentages given
  after the prime digit column refer to the number of <em>odd</em>
  digits which appear.  Base 5 reads 200% in this column as numbers
  ending in even digits can also be prime.
 </font>
 <p>
 Another index that can be used is called the regularity index.
 This index gives the percentage of regular numbers from 2 to one less
 than the base that are in a given base.  (A regular number is one whose
 reciprocal, when expressed as a decimal fraction, terminates in the
 given base.)  A table of regular numbers appears below, along with the
 regularity index for each base.
 <p>
 <center>
  <table border=2>
   <tr><th>Base</th><th>Regular Numbers</th><th>Regularity Index (%)</th></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>2</td><td>[none]</td><td align=center>0</td><tr>
   <tr><td align=center>5</td><td>[none]</td><td align=center>0</td><tr>
   <tr><td align=center>8</td><td>2, 4</td><td align=center>33</td><tr>
   <tr><td align=center>10</td><td>2, 4, 5, 8</td><td align=center>50</td><tr>
   <tr><td align=center>12</td><td>2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9</td><td align=center>60</td><tr>
   <tr><td align=center>16</td><td>2, 4, 8</td><td align=center>21</td><tr>
   <tr><td align=center>20</td><td>2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15</td><td align=center>33</td><tr>
   <tr><td align=center>60</td><td>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48, 54</td><td align=center>41</td><tr>
  </table>
 </center>
 <font size=-1>
  Note on the table:  The regular numbers listed reflect only those
  between 2 and base-1.
 </font>
 <p>
 Now that we have all of this data, how do we compare the relative
 usefulness of the various number bases?  We need to create some sort of
 index that will quantify this usefulness.  A positive consideration needs
 to be given to the regularity index, and a smaller positive consideration
 to the fact that a larger base yields a more compact notation.  Negative
 consideration should be given for the number of different digits that
 ca end primes and squares, as well as the negative influence brought
 on by the size of the multiplication table.  A possible formula could be:
 <p>
 <center>
  I = (R * ln(b)) / (P * S * b)
 </center>
 <p>
 where:
 <p>
 <blockquote>
  <table>
   <tr><th>b</th><td>is the base in question</td></tr>
   <tr><th>R</th><td>is the regularity index</td></tr>
   <tr><th>P</th><td>is the percentage of odd digits found at the ends of prime numbers</td></tr>
   <tr><th>S</th><td>is the percentage of all digits found at the ends of perfect squares</td></tr>
  </table>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
 This yields the following table:
 <p>
 <center>
  <table border=2>
   <tr><th>Base</th><th>Index</th></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>2</td><td align=center>.000</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>5</td><td align=center>.000</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>8</td><td align=center>.231</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>10</td><td align=center>.240</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>12</td><td align=center>.559</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>16</td><td align=center>.146</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>20</td><td align=center>.206</td></tr>
   <tr><td align=center>60</td><td align=center>.245</td></tr>
  </table>
 </center>
 <p>
 This table indicates that base 12, by far, is a much more logical base
 to do arithmetic in.  Bases 8, 10 and 60 seem to have fared about
 equally well (even with base 60's enormous multiplication table).
 It would seem that base 12 is so much higher because it combines good
 divisibility patterns (noted by the regularity index) with a fairly
 small set of operation tables.
 <p>
 Contrariwise, note bases 2 and 5 bringing up the rear.  For base 5, the
 reason is that there are no terminating decimal fractions and the fact
 that, as an odd-numbered base, we have more difficulty finding odd and
 even numbers.  This is reflected in the fact that a prime number may end
 in any digit.  For example:  31<font size=-1>(5)</font> equals 3 * 5 +
 1 or 16<font size=-1>(10)</font>, an even number, has an odd last digit.
 By contrast, 21<font size=-1>(5)</font> = 11<font size=-1>(10)</font>,
 an odd number.  Base 2 fails mainly because it is so cumbersome to work
 with, and that the nature of a binary number is not intuitively obvious
 (given by high values of P and S).  The regularity index of base 2, zero,
 may not be entirely accurate, however.  There are simply no integers
 between 2 and 1.  We might set the regularity index to 50%; this would
 give a final index value of .173, still quite low, but more appropriate.
 <p>
 Should we convert to base 12?  Probably, but given the inertia inherent
 in the present number system, conversion would be far more trouble than
 its worth.
