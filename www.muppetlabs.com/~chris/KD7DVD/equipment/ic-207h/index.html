<h1>Icom IC-207H Dual-Band Mobile Transceiver</h1>
An inexpensive single-VFO transceiver.  Has extended receive in
the VHF band, 136-174 MHz, and air band receive, 118-136 MHz.
Transmits in the 2m band 144-148 MHz, and in the 70cm band 
from 440-450 only.  (I don't know why; Icom's mobiles just 
seem to be that way...)
<p>
This radio has a separate output from the discriminator which
makes it ideal for 9600-baud packet applications.  Normally I
use it with a Kantronics 9612 Plus for 9600-baud TCP/IP
<p>
Output power is selectable from 5, 10, 20 and 50 watts (VHF; high power
on UHF is 35 watts)
<p>
The radio is

giving the following capabilities:

<p>
Note:  because this radio lacks type acceptance for any radio service
requiring such, it is unlawful to use this radio on non-amateur
frequencies <em>no matter what licenses you may have</em>.  (Statement
applies in the United States of America.  Your milage may vary.)
On the other hand, when the waste matter hits the rotating blades,
being able to call for help from a GMRS-toting REACT crew (462.675)
or from the Coast Guard (Marine Channel 16, 156.800) is a nice feature.
<p>
The modifications can be screwed up, too, giving you the following 
capabilities:

If you end up with a radio like this, I want to hear NOTHING about
it...
