Currently located in the main shack.  This is one of the "multi-multi"
radios that do everything, and sometimes even well.  I have the 6/2 and
440 antenna ports connected to a triplexer and then to a Comet GP-15
triband antenna.  The HF goes to a MFJ-969 tuner and to a dipole.
<p>
Lots of connection ports in back.  4 antenna ports!  Internal keyer for
your paddle (no memories, though).  I have my PK232 on the keyer port.
RS232 for computer control.  Packet and AFSK data ports.  And the
obligatory tuner and amplifier controls.
<p>
I've cobbled together a control program for Linux, should you feel
the need to have a command line interface for your radio :).  Mostly
it's an application library and test application.  Feel free to play.
