 <h1>IC 2500A Cross Band Repeater Setup</h1>

 In this example, we will make a 23 cm repeater accessible to users
 with 70 cm handhelds.  We will control the link with CTCSS tones.
 <p>
 Our repeater output frequency is 12xx.xx MHz (-20 MHz offset), and our
 link frequency will be 44x.xxx MHz.   We'll use the tone 91.5 Hz for
 access control.  
 <p>
 The handheld user, then, would select 44x.xxx simplex, and transmit a
 91.5 Hz tone for access.  This user should key up, wait 2 seconds, then
 begin speaking, to give both repeaters a chance to warm up.
 <p>
 Setting up the IC-2500A:
 <p>
 <ol>
  <li>Put both bands in VFO mode.
  <li>Set up the output band with repeater frequency (12xx.xx MHz),
  offset and tone (if needed) as listed in the repeater guide or given
  by the repeater operator.
  <li>Set other band for simplex, 44x.xxx MHz with 91.5 Hz tone squelch.
  <li>Give the squelch a little space.  A hairline squelch will QRM the
  repeater input (and the output.  and a whole bunch of repeater users.)
  <li>Turn off radio.
  <li>With the power off, push and hold following buttons:
  <p>MONI, CALL, SET, and DOWN button on microphone
  <p>while holding all above, turn on power.
 </ol>
 <p>
 Restoring normal operation:
 <p>
 <ol>
  <li>With power on, hold SET button and hit CALL button
 </ol>
 <p>
 Troubleshooting:
 <p>
 <ol>
  <li>Try resetting the CPU:  Power off; hold the MONI and MW buttons; 
  power on.  (Yes, this erases memory!)
  <li>Remove diode D9 from the logic board.  The logic board is the 
  small board right behind the front panel display.  This is not for the 
  weak at heart.  Remove the large tuning knob, and the sleeve ring
  around the microphone jack.  Remove the top and bottom covers, and then
  remove the 4 screws holding the front panel in place.
  <p>
  Then remove 5 screws securing the display/logic board to the chassis.
  Be careful about some grounding straps around the edge of this board;
  you'll be loosening them, too.  Carefully pull the board away from the 
  chassis and see the row of diodes just about in line with the main volume
  knob.  D9 (if it's there to begin with) is the second from the bottom 
  of that row.  Carefully clip the lead.  Even more carefully reverse
  your disassembly.  Secure the logic board, replace the display cover,
  and its screws, then the top and bottom covers and their screws.
  <p>
  Replace the microphone sleeve ring and the main tuning knob and you're
  done.  Newer units didn't have this diode to begin with, but mine did.
  My serial number is 01155.
 </ol>
 <p>
 Legal notes:
 <p>
 <ol>
  <li>Crossbanding someone else's repeater is considered poor form.
  Cross banding your own is ok.  Getting permission is a fine idea.
  <li>Your link station must ID, too!  Of course, if the link and
  the repeater have the same call signs, you're probably, OK.  Otherwise
  you'll need an external keyer.  (But note that the PTT line on the
  radio is disabled when in crossband mode!  Oops!  Looks like you'll
  need to hook that keyer to another transmitter...)
  <li>As always, use minimum power.
 </ol>
