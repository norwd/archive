 <h1>Amateur radio is not CB.</h1>

 <strong>"Oh, you mean CB, right?"</strong>
 <p>
 No, Good Buddy, Amateur Radio is a completely different service with
 different goals, different technical parameters and different equipment.
 In short, CB is used for <em>talking</em> and just talking, whether 
 you're shooting the breeze or calling the dispatcher at your trucking company.
 Amateur radio is oriented toward radio experimentation and formal communications.
 Yes, shooting the breeze gets included there, although business communications
 do not.  Community service and emergency communications are a big part
 of the amateur world.  I don't need to say that to folks in disaster-prone
 areas, though :-)
 <p>
 If all you want to do on the radio is chitchat, and you don't care about
 how the radio works, or how to make it work better, CB (or FRS, maybe)
 is for you.  But, if you want to experiment with radios, learn how they
 work, build your own transmitters and help serve your community, then
 I invite and encourage you to get a license and get on the air.

 Here's some points of comparison:
