&lt;IJ89&gt; is RJL20 about, there at headbone?<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; motherfucker.  c2.net's website is fucking worthless in lynx<br>
* RJL20 is about 5'11" here at headbone.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; IJ89: yes<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; only 5'11"?<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; no way<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; you're *huge*<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Last time I got measured on the wall at my folks' place, that's what it was.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; when i looked at penn jillette, i thought to myself, "there's josh"<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Heh. "No". He's like 6'4" or something.<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; i sense some RJL20 worship<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; heh.  "no"<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; *snap* Darn.<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; heh....  "i wouldn't be so sure, TT205"<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; no, you *are* huge, though, RJL20.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; freud is such a quakc<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; i mean, i'm short.<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; quack<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; i *know* this.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Must be all those growth hormones I'm taking.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Have I sprouted yet?<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; ooooh, do you have wings?<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; *flapflap*<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; but bench is 5'11", too, and he doesn't tower over me like you do.<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; woohoo!<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; you guys are not the same height.<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; RJL20 is just so *powerful*<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Maybe, umm... Maybe his fuller beard makes him look smaller?<br>
* TT205 's brain *pops*<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Maybe he's actually not 5'11"? I was pretty sure I was 5'10" until last week when my mom measured me.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; hmmmmm.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; stand up.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; And, well, I'm _wider_.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; okay.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; so you *are* the same height as him.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Heh.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; why did i think you were about 6 foot 4?<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; I may be bigger. I just don't think I'm taller.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Ya know, this could come in handy.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Maybe I have that cat skill.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Puff myself up, look big. Nobody will attack me.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; *hiss*<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; oh!  i know!<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; it's your *arms*<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; they're *huge*<br>
* RJL20 looks at his arms.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; they're really, really long.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Oh.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; like, not *human* long<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; My arms are very long.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; It's why I always wear long sleeve shirts with rolled up sleeves.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; I can't find shirts in my size with long enough arms.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; "breaks the line"<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; So I roll them.<br>
* RJL20 drags his knuckles on the ground and makes ape noises.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; *ungh*<br>
* TT205 would like to state, for the record, that she is not fucking insane<br>
* IJ89 *understands* RJL20's pain<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; hey!<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; i'm not that bad to work with.<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; NO, about the shirts, not about you<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Except for the occasional "My god, you're huge!" comment.<br>
* KP875 also understands RJL20's pain<br>
* RJL20 rereads that. Hmm.<br>
* TT205 hurts self laughing<br>
=gorlak= [13:40] #TT205# topic "My god, you're huge!"<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; let's not go too far there...<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Damn.<br>
* RJL20 looks down at TT205. "What happened? Did you go through the dryer? You didn't used to be that tiny, did you?"<br>
* RJL20 grows to 50 feet high and starts stomping through downtown new york, toppling newsstands and tossing cabs about.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; *rar*<br>
* TT205 pokes RJL20's foot with a fork and crawls up his back<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; *pfffffffffffffffssssssssst*<br>
* RJL20 deflates.<br>
* IJ89 reconsiders dropping by THE_BONE<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; BS2713<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; Better not. This way madness lies.<br>
=gorlak= [13:43] #RJL20# topic * TT205 pokes RJL20's foot with a fork and crawls up his back<br>
* IJ89 puts on his SERIAL_KILLER_GLOVES<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; wow.  i really have no smartass comment for that one.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; HEH<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; you win, RJL20.<br>
&lt;IJ89&gt; see yopu guys in a bit...<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; You set yourself up for these, TT205. You're the perfect straight man.<br>
* TT205 is *not* a straight man.<br>
&lt;RJL20&gt; *cough*<br>
* RJL20 attempts to finish removing people who asked to be removed from the spam list.<br>
* TT205 suddenly tastes fish.<br>
&lt;TT205&gt; i wonder why.<br>
