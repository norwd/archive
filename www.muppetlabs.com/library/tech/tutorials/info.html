  A note:  I'd like to thank everyone for the kind words, I'm very
  happy to have put together a collection of sites that other people
  think are helpful as well.  If you have any comments, suggestions,
  more tutorials, flames, whatever, direct them to me at
  <a href="mailto:ben@muppetlabs.com">

  I now have a link checker script running that mails me with dead
  links.  It runs once a week.  This should make life a bit less
  frustrating, but when links disappear I need more to fill them in!
  I'm more than happy to make the script available for anyone
  interested, or post it if there's enough interest.  It's basically a
  rip off of a couple scripts in the perl cookbook by O'Reilly.

  And finally, I'm always looking for

  tutorials.  So send them my way.  I'll shortly have a mail filter
  set up that lets me add tutorials without mucking around in html.
