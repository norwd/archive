<p>	Pursuant to Section 595(c) of Title 28, the Office of
Independent Counsel (OIC) hereby submits substantial and credible
information that President Clinton obstructed justice during the
<u>Jones v. Clinton</u> sexual harassment lawsuit by lying under oath
and concealing evidence of his relationship with a young White
House intern and federal employee, Monica Lewinsky.  After a
federal criminal investigation of the President's actions began
in January 1998, the President lied under oath to the grand jury
and obstructed justice during the grand jury investigation. 
There also is substantial and credible information that the
President's actions with respect to Monica Lewinsky constitute an
abuse of authority inconsistent with the President's
constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.

<p>	There is substantial and credible information supporting the
following eleven possible grounds for impeachment:  

<p>	1.  President Clinton lied under oath in his civil case when
he denied a sexual affair, a sexual relationship, or sexual
relations with Monica Lewinsky. 

<p>	2.  President Clinton lied under oath to the grand jury
about his sexual relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.

<p>	3.  In his civil deposition, to support his false statement
about the sexual relationship, President Clinton also lied under
oath about being alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and about the many gifts
exchanged between Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and him.

<p>	4.  President Clinton lied under oath in his civil
deposition about his discussions with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky concerning her
involvement in the <u>Jones</u> case. 

<p>	5.  During the <u>Jones</u> case, the President obstructed justice
and had an understanding with Ms. Lewinsky to jointly conceal the
truth about their relationship by concealing gifts subpoenaed by
Ms. Jones's attorneys.

<p>	6.  During the <u>Jones</u> case, the President obstructed justice
and had an understanding with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to jointly conceal the
truth of their relationship from the judicial process by a scheme
that included the following means:  (i)&nbsp;Both the President and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky understood that they would lie under oath in the
<u>Jones</u> case about their sexual relationship; (ii)&nbsp;the President
suggested to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that she prepare an affidavit that, for
the President's purposes, would memorialize her testimony under
oath and could be used to prevent questioning of both of them
about their relationship; (iii)&nbsp;Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky signed and filed the
false affidavit; (iv)&nbsp;the President used Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's false
affidavit at his deposition in an attempt to head off questions
about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky; and (v)&nbsp;when that failed, the President lied
under oath at his civil deposition about the relationship with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.	

<p>	7.  President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by
helping Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky obtain a job in New York at a time when she
would have been a witness harmful to him were she to tell the
truth in the <u>Jones</u> case.

<p>	8.  President Clinton lied under oath in his civil
deposition about his discussions with Vernon Jordan concerning
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's involvement in the <u>Jones</u> case. 

<p>	9.  The President improperly tampered with a potential
witness by attempting to corruptly influence the testimony of his
personal secretary, Betty Currie, in the days after his civil
deposition. 

<p>	10.  President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice during
the grand jury investigation by refusing to testify for seven
months <u>and</u> lying to senior White House aides with knowledge that
they would relay the President's false statements to the grand
jury -- and did thereby deceive, obstruct, and impede the grand
jury.

<p>	11.  President Clinton abused his constitutional authority
by (i)&nbsp;lying to the public and the Congress in January 1998 about
his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky; (ii)&nbsp;promising at that time
to cooperate fully with the grand jury investigation; (iii)&nbsp;later
refusing six invitations to testify voluntarily to the grand
jury; (iv)&nbsp;invoking Executive Privilege; (v)&nbsp;lying to the grand
jury in August 1998; and (vi)&nbsp;lying again to the public and
Congress on August 17, 1998 -- all as part of an effort to
hinder, impede, and deflect possible inquiry by the Congress of
the United States.

<p>	The first two possible grounds for impeachment concern the
President's lying under oath about the nature of his relationship
with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  The details associated with those grounds
are, by their nature, explicit.  The President's testimony
unfortunately has rendered the details essential with respect to
those two grounds, as will be explained in those grounds.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On May 6, 1994, former Arkansas state employee Paula Corbin
Jones filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against President
Clinton claiming that he had sexually harassed her on May 8,
1991, by requesting her to perform oral sex on him in a suite at
the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock.  Throughout the pretrial
discovery process in <u>Jones v. Clinton</u>, United States District
Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled, over the President's objections,
that Ms.&nbsp;Jones's lawyers could seek various categories of
information, including information about women who had worked as
government employees under Governor or President Clinton and
allegedly had sexual activity with him.  Judge Wright's rulings
followed the prevailing law in sexual harassment cases:  The
defendant's sexual relationships with others in the workplace,
including consensual relationships, are a standard subject of
inquiry during the discovery process.  Judge Wright recognized
the commonplace nature of her discovery rulings and stated that
she was following a "meticulous standard of materiality" in
allowing such questioning.  

<p>	At a hearing on January 12, 1998, Judge Wright required
Ms.&nbsp;Jones to list potential trial witnesses.  Ms.&nbsp;Jones's list
included several "Jane Does."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys said they
intended to call a Jane Doe named Monica Lewinsky as a witness to
support Ms.&nbsp;Jones's claims.  Under Ms.&nbsp;Jones's legal theory,
women who had sexual relationships with the President received
job benefits because of the sexual relationship, but women who
resisted the President's sexual advances were denied such
benefits.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>

<p>	On January 17, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Jones's lawyers deposed President
Clinton under oath with Judge Wright present and presiding over
the deposition.  Federal law requires a witness testifying under
oath to provide truthful answers.  The intentional failure to
provide truthful answers is a crime punishable by imprisonment

<p>and fine.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  At the outset of his deposition, the President took
an oath administered by Judge Wright:  "Do you swear or affirm
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the testimony you are about to give in the matter
before the court is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?"  The President replied:  "I do."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
At the beginning of their questioning, Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys
asked the President:  "And your testimony is subject to the
penalty of perjury; do you understand that, sir?"  The President
responded, "I do."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

<p>	Based on the witness list received in December 1997 (which
included Ms. Lewinsky) and the January 12, 1998, hearing, the
President and his attorneys were aware that Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys
likely would question the President at his deposition about
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and the other "Jane Does."  In fact, the attorneys
for Ms.&nbsp;Jones did ask numerous questions about "Jane Does,"
including Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.

<p>	There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton lied under oath in answering those questions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a name="L12"><strong>	1.	President Clinton's Statements Under Oath About Monica

Lewinsky</strong>

<p>	

<p>	During pretrial discovery, Paula Jones's attorneys served
the President with written interrogatories.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  One stated in
relevant part:

<p>	Please state the name, address, and telephone number of
each and every [federal employee] with whom you had
sexual relations when you [were] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. President of the
United States.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The interrogatory did not define the term "sexual relations." 
Judge Wright ordered the President to answer the interrogatory,
and on December 23, 1997, under penalty of perjury, President
Clinton answered "None."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>

<p>	At the January 17, 1998, deposition of the President,
Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys asked the President specific questions
about possible sexual activity with Monica Lewinsky.  The
attorneys used various terms in their questions, including
"sexual affair," "sexual relationship," and "sexual relations." 
The terms "sexual affair" and "sexual relationship" were not
specially defined by Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys.  The term "sexual
relations" was defined:

<p>	For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages
in "sexual relations" when the person knowingly engages
in or causes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. contact with the genitalia, anus,
groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person
with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire
of any person.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  "Contact" means intentional
touching, either directly or through clothing.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>	

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	President Clinton answered a series of questions about
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, including:

<p>	Q:	Did you have an extramarital sexual affair with
Monica Lewinsky?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>No.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	If she told someone that she had a sexual affair
with you beginning in November of 1995, would that
be a lie?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>It's certainly not the truth.  It would not be the
truth.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	I think I used the term "sexual affair."  And so
the record is completely clear, have you ever had
sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that
term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as
modified by the Court?

<p>		

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Bennett:<a href="7grounds.htm#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>	

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Judge Wright:	

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Well, it's real short.  He can -- I will permit
the question and you may show the witness
definition number one.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky.  I've never had an affair with her</u>.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>President Clinton reiterated his denial under questioning by his
own attorney:

<p>	Q:	In paragraph eight of [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's] affidavit,
she says this, "I have never had a sexual
relationship with the President, he did not
propose that we have a sexual relationship, he did
not offer me employment or other benefits in
exchange for a sexual relationship, he did not
deny me employment or other benefits for rejecting
a sexual relationship."  Is that a true and
accurate statement as far as you know it?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>That is absolutely true.</u><a href="7grounds.htm#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a name="L13"><strong>	2.  Monica Lewinsky's Testimony</strong>

<p>	Monica Lewinsky testified under oath before the grand jury
that, beginning in November 1995, when she was a 22-year-old
White House intern, she had a lengthy relationship with the
President that included substantial sexual activity.  She
testified in detail about the times, dates, and nature of ten
sexual encounters that involved some form of genital contact.  As
explained in the Narrative section of this Referral, White House
records corroborate Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony in that the
President was in the Oval Office area during the encounters.  The
records of White House entry and exit are incomplete for
employees, but they do show her presence in the White House on
eight of those occasions.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>   

<p>	The ten incidents are recounted here because they are
necessary to assess whether the President lied under oath, both
in his civil deposition, where he denied any sexual relationship
at all, and in his grand jury testimony, where he acknowledged an
"inappropriate intimate contact" but denied <u>any</u> sexual contact
with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia.  When reading the
following descriptions, the President's denials under oath should
be kept in mind.  

<p>	Unfortunately, the nature of the President's denials
requires that the contrary evidence be set forth in detail.  If
the President, in his grand jury appearance, had admitted the
sexual activity recounted by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and conceded that he
had lied under oath in his civil deposition, these particular
descriptions would be superfluous.  Indeed, we refrained from
questioning Ms. Lewinsky under oath about particular details
until after the President's August 17 testimony made that
questioning necessary.  But in view of (i) the President's
denials, (ii) his continued contention that his civil deposition
testimony was legally accurate under the terms and definitions
employed, and (iii) his refusal to answer related questions, the
detail is critical.  The detail provides credibility and
corroboration to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony.  It also demonstrates
with clarity that the Pres ident lied under oath <u>both</u> in his
civil deposition <u>and</u> to the federal grand jury.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>  There is
substantial and credible information that the President's lies
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky were abundant and
calculating. >

<p><a name="L14"><strong>		(i)  Wednesday, November 15, 1995</strong>  

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she had her first sexual contact
with the President on the evening of Wednesday, November 15,
1995, while she was an intern at the White House.  Two times that
evening, the President invited Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to meet him near the
Oval Office.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  On the first occasion, the President took
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky back into the Oval Office study, and they kissed.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> 
On the second, she performed oral sex on the President in the
hallway outside the Oval Office study.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  During this encounter,
the President directly touched and kissed Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's bare
breasts.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>  In addition, the President put his hand down
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's pants and directly stimulated her genitalia (acts

evening.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>  The President initiated this encounter by having his

unbuttoned her dress and fondled her breasts, first with her bra

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she met with President Clinton

1997.  They kissed, and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky touched the President's
genitals through his clothing, but he rebuffed her efforts to
perform oral sex.  No other sexual acts occurred during this
encounter.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a> 

<p>	On Sunday, December 28, 1997, three weeks before the
President's civil deposition in the <u>Jones</u> case, the President and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met in the Oval Office.  In addition to discussing a
number of issues that are analyzed below, they engaged in
"passionate" kissing -- she said, "I don't call it a brief kiss." 
No other sexual contact occurred.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President engaged in
"phone sex" approximately fifteen times.  The President initiated
each phone sex encounter by telephoning Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>    

<p><a name="L26"><strong>	4.  Physical Evidence</strong>

<p>>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky produced to OIC investigators a dress she wore
during the encounter on February 28, 1997, which she believed
might be stained with the President's semen.  At the request of
the OIC, the FBI Laboratory examined the dress and found semen
stains.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>  At that point, the OIC requested a DNA sample from the
President.  On August 3, 1998, two weeks before the President's

<p>	<a name="L38"><strong>6.  Summary</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The detailed testimony of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, her corroborating
prior consistent statements to her friends, family members, and
counselors, and the evidence of the President's semen on
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's dress establish that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and the
President engaged in substantial sexual activity between November
15, 1995, and December 28, 1997.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>  

<p>	The President, however, testified under oath in the civil
case -- both in his deposition and in a written answer to an
interrogatory -- that he did <u>not</u> have a "sexual relationship" or
a "sexual affair" or "sexual relations" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  In
addition, he denied engaging in activity covered by a more
specific definition of "sexual relations" used at the
deposition.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>

<p>	In his civil case, the President made five different false
statements related to the sexual relationship.  For four of the
five statements, the President asserts a semantic defense:  The
President argues that the terms used in the <u>Jones</u> deposition to
cover sexual activity did not cover the sexual activity in which
he engaged with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  For his other false statements,
the President's response is factual -- namely, he disputes
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's account that he ever touched her breasts or
genitalia during sexual activity.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a>

<p>	The President's denials -- semantic and factual -- do not
withstand scrutiny.  

<p>	<u>First</u><a name="L39"><strong>,</strong> in his civil deposition, the President denied a
"sexual affair" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky (the term was not defined). 
The President's response to lying under oath on this point rests
on his definition of "sexual affair" -- namely, that it requires
sexual intercourse, no matter how extensive the sexual activities
might otherwise be.  According to the President, a man could
regularly engage in oral sex and fondling of breasts and genitals
with a woman and yet not have a "sexual affair" with her. 

<p>	<u>Second</u>, in his civil deposition, the President also denied a
"sexual relationship" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky (the term was not
defined).  The President's response to lying under oath on this
point similarly rests on his definition of "sexual relationship"
-- namely, that it requires sexual intercourse.  Once again,
under the President's theory, a man could regularly engage in
oral sex and fondling of breasts and genitals with a woman, yet
not have a "sexual relationship" with her. 

<p>	The President's claim as to his interpretation of "sexual
relationship" is belied by the fact that the President's own
lawyer -- earlier at that same deposition -- equated the term
"sexual relationship" with "sex of any kind in any manner, shape
or form."  The President's lawyer offered that interpretation
when requesting Judge Wright to limit the questioning to prevent
further inquiries with respect to Monica Lewinsky.  As the
videotape of the deposition reveals, the President was present
and apparently looking in the direction of his attorney when his
attorney offered that statement.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>  The President gave no
indication that he disagreed with his attorney's straightforward
interpretation that the term "sexual relationship" means "sex of
any kind in any manner, shape, or form."  Nor did the President
thereafter take any steps to correct the attorney's statement.  

<p>	<u>Third</u>, in an answer to an interrogatory submitted before his
deposition, the President denied having "sexual relations" with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky (the term was not defined).  Yet again, the
President's apparent rejoinder to lying under oath on this point
rests on his definition of "sexual relations" -- that it, too,
requires sexual intercourse.  According to President Clinton,
oral sex does not constitute sexual relations. 

<p>	<u>Fourth</u>, in his civil deposition, the President denied
committing any acts that fell within the specific definition of
"sexual relations" that was in effect for purposes of that
deposition.  Under that specific definition, sexual relations
occurs "when the person knowingly engages in or causes contact
with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks
of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual
desire of any person."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>  Thus, the President denied engaging in
or causing contact with the genitalia, breasts, or anus of "any
person" with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of
"any person." 

<p>	Concerning oral sex, the President's sole answer to the
charge that he lied under oath at the deposition focused on his
interpretation of "any person" in the definition.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
testified that she performed oral sex on the President on nine
occasions.  The President said that by <u>receiving</u> oral sex, he
would not "engage in" or "cause"<a href="7grounds.htm#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a> contact with the genitalia,
anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of "any person"
because "any person" really means "any <u>other</u> person."  The
President further testified before the grand jury:  "[I]f the
deponent is the person who has oral sex performed on him, then
the contact is with -- <u>not with anything on that list, but with
the lips of another person</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a>  

<p>	The President's linguistic parsing is unreasonable.  Under
the President's interpretation (which he says he followed at his
deposition), in an oral sex encounter, one person <u>is</u> engaged in
sexual relations, but the other person <u>is not</u> engaged in sexual
relations.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>

<p>	Even assuming that the definitional language can be
manipulated to exclude the deponent's receipt of oral sex, the
President is still left with the difficulty that reasonable
persons would not have understood it that way.  And in context,
the President's semantics become even weaker:  The <u>Jones</u> suit
rested on the allegation that the President sought to have
Ms.&nbsp;Jones perform oral sex on him.  Yet the President now claims
that the expansive definition devised for deposition questioning
should be interpreted to exclude that very act. 

<p>	<u>Fifth</u>, by denying at his civil deposition that he had
engaged in any acts falling within the specific definition of
"sexual relations," the President denied engaging in or causing
contact with the breasts or genitalia of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky with an
intent to arouse or gratify one's sexual desire.  In contrast to
his explanations of the four preceding false statements under
oath, the President's defense to lying under oath in this
instance is purely <u>factual</u>. 

<p>	As discussed above, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified credibly that the
President touched and kissed her bare breasts on nine occasions,
and that he stimulated her genitals on four occasions.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a>  She
also testified about a cigar incident, which is discussed above. 
In addition, a deleted computer file from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's home
computer contained an apparent draft letter to the President that
explicitly referred to an incident in which the President's
"mouth [was] on [her] breast" and implicitly referred to direct
contact with her genitalia.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>  This draft letter further
corroborates Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony.

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's prior consistent statements to various
friends, family members, and counselors -- made when the
relationship was ongoing -- likewise corroborate her testimony on
the nature of the President's touching of her body.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
had no apparent motive to lie to her friends, family members, and
counselors.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky especially had no reason to lie to
Dr.&nbsp;Kassorla and Ms.&nbsp;Estep, to whom she related the facts in the
course of a professional relationship.  And Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's
statements to some that she did not have intercourse with the
President, even though she wanted to do so, enhances the
credibility of her statements.  Moreover, the precise nature of
the sexual activity only became relevant after the President
interposed his semantic defense regarding oral sex on August 17,
1998.

<p>	By contrast, the President's testimony strains credulity. 
His apparent "hands-off" scenario -- in which he would have
received oral sex on <u>nine</u> occasions from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky but never
made direct contact with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia --
is not credible.  The President's claim seems to be that he
maintained a hands-off policy in ongoing sexual encounters with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, which coincidentally happened to permit him to
truthfully deny "sexual relations" with her at a deposition
occurring a few years in the future.  As Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky noted, it
suggests some kind of "service contract -- that all I did was
perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship
was."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a> 	

<p>	The President also had strong personal, political, and legal
motives to lie in the <u>Jones</u> deposition:  He did not want to admit
that he had committed extramarital sex acts with a young intern
in the Oval Office area of the White House.  Such an admission
could support Ms.&nbsp;Jones's theory of liability and would embarrass
him.  Indeed, the President admitted that during the relationship
he did what he could to keep the relationship secret, including
"misleading" members of his family and Cabinet.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>  The President
testified, moreover, that he "hoped that this relationship would
never become public."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a>   

<p>	At the time of his civil deposition, the President also
could have presumed that he could lie under oath without risk
because -- as he knew -- Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had already filed a false
affidavit denying a sexual relationship with the President. 
Indeed, they had an understanding that each would lie under oath
(explained more fully in Ground VI below).  So the President
might have expected that he could lie without consequence on the
belief that no one could ever successfully challenge his denial
of a sexual relationship with her.

<p>	<u>In sum</u>, based on all of the evidence and considering the
President's various responses, there is substantial and credible
information that the President lied under oath in his civil
deposition and his interrogatory answer in denying a sexual
relationship, a sexual affair, or sexual relations with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a> 

<p><a name="L40"><strong>II.	There is substantial and credible information that President

Clinton lied under oath to the grand jury about his sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a name="L41"><strong>A.  Background</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>>In January 1998, upon application of the Attorney General,
the Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit expanded the OIC's jurisdiction
to investigate, among other matters, whether Monica Lewinsky and
the President obstructed justice in the <u>Jones</u> case.  The criminal
investigation was triggered by specific and credible evidence
that Monica Lewinsky denied her relationship with President
Clinton in a false affidavit in the <u>Jones</u> case, that she had
spoken to the President and Vernon Jordan about her testimony,
and that she may have been influenced to lie by the President
through the assistance of Vernon Jordan and others in finding her
a job.  After the President, in his January 17 deposition, denied
any sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky and otherwise
minimized his overall relationship with her, the President's
testimony became an additional subject of the OIC investigation.  

<p>	The threshold factual question was whether the President and
Monica Lewinsky in fact had a sexual relationship.  If they did,
the President would have committed perjury in his civil
deposition and interrogatory answer:  The President, as noted in
Ground I above, had denied a sexual affair, sexual relationship,
or sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, including any direct
contact with her breasts or genitalia.  The answer to the
preliminary factual question also could alter the interpretation
of several possibly obstructionist acts by the President -- the
employment assistance for Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the concealment of gifts
he had given to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the discussion between the
President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky of her testimony or affidavit, the
President's post-deposition communications with Betty Currie, and
the President's emphatic denials of a relationship to his aides
who later testified before the grand jury.

<p>	During the investigation, the OIC gathered a substantial
body of information that established that the President and
Monica Lewinsky did, in fact, have a sexual relationship.  That
information is outlined in Ground I above.  In particular, the
information includes: (i)&nbsp;the detailed and credible testimony of
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky regarding the 10 sexual encounters; (ii)&nbsp;the
President's semen stain on Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's dress; and (iii)&nbsp;the
testimony of friends, family members, and counselors to whom she
made near-contemporaneous statements about the relationship.  All
of this evidence pointed to a single conclusion -- that she and
the President did have a sexual relationship.

<p><a name="L42"><strong>B.  The President's Grand Jury Testimony</strong>

<p>	The President was largely aware of that extensive body of
evidence before he testified to the grand jury on August 17,
1998.  Not only did the President know that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had
reached an immunity agreement with this Office in exchange for
her truthful testimony, but the President knew from public
reports and his own knowledge that his semen might be on one of
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's dresses.  The OIC had asked him for a blood sample
on August 3, 1998 (two weeks before his grand jury testimony) and
assured his counsel that there was a substantial predicate for
the request, which reasonably implied that there was semen on the
dress.

<p>	As a result, the President had three apparent choices in his
testimony to the grand jury.  <u>First</u>, the President could adhere
to his previous testimony in his civil case, as well as in his
public statements, and deny any sexual relationship.  But he knew
(or at least, had reason to know) that the contrary evidence was
overwhelming, particularly if his semen were in fact on Ms.
Lewinsky's dress.  <u>Second</u>, the President could admit a sexual
relationship, which would cause him also to simultaneously admit
that he lied under oath in the <u>Jones</u> case.  <u>Third</u>, the President
could invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled
self-incrimination.  

<p>	Confronting those three options, the President attempted to
avoid them altogether.  The President admitted to an
"inappropriate intimate" relationship, but he maintained that he
had not committed perjury in the <u>Jones</u> case when he denied having
a sexual relationship, sexual affair, or sexual relations with
her.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a>  The President contended that he had believed his various
statements in the <u>Jones</u> case to be legally accurate.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>  He also
testified that the inappropriate relationship began not in
November 1995 when Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was an intern, as Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
and other witnesses have testified, but in 1996.  

<p>	During his grand jury testimony, the President was asked
whether Monica Lewinsky performed oral sex on him and, if so,
whether he had committed perjury in his civil deposition by
denying a sexual relationship, sexual affair, or sexual relations
with her.  The President refused to say whether he had oral sex. 
Instead, the President said (i)&nbsp;that the undefined terms "sexual
affair," "sexual relationship," and "sexual relations"
necessarily require sexual intercourse, (ii)&nbsp;that he had not
engaged in intercourse with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, and (iii)&nbsp;that he
therefore had not committed perjury in denying a sexual
relationship, sexual affair, or sexual relations.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a>

<p>	A more specific definition of "sexual relations" had also
been used at the civil deposition.  As to that definition, the
President said to the grand jury that he does not and did not
believe oral sex was covered.

<p>	Q:	[I]s oral sex performed on you within that
definition as you understood it, the
definition in the Jones --

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	A:	As I understood it, it was not; no.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a>  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The President thus contended that he had not committed perjury on
that question in the <u>Jones</u> deposition -- even assuming that
Monica Lewinsky performed oral sex on him.  

<p>	There still was the question of his contact with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts and genitalia, which the President
conceded would fall within the <u>Jones</u> definition of sexual
relations.  The President denied that he had engaged in such
activity and said, in effect, that Monica Lewinsky was lying:

<p>	Q:	The question is, if Monica Lewinsky says that
while you were in the Oval Office area you touched
her breasts would she by lying?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	A:	<u>That is not my recollection</u>.  My recollection is
that I did not have sexual relations with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and I'm staying on my former
statement about that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  My, my statement is
that I did not have sexual relations as defined by
that.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	If she says that you kissed her breasts, would she
be lying?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a name="L43"><strong>C.  Summary</strong>

<p>	In the foregoing testimony to the grand jury, the President
lied under oath three times.

<p>	1.  The President testified that he believed oral sex was
not covered by <u>any</u> of the terms and definitions for sexual
activity used at the <u>Jones</u> deposition.  That testimony is not
credible:  At the <u>Jones</u> deposition, the President could not have
believed that he was telling "the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth" in denying a sexual relationship, sexual
relations, or a sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky.  

<p>	2.  In all events, even putting aside his <u>definitional</u>
defense, the President made a second false statement to the grand
jury.  The President's grand jury testimony contradicts
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's grand jury testimony on the question whether the
President touched Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia during
their sexual activity.  There can be no contention that one of
them has a lack of memory or is mistaken.  On this issue, either
Monica Lewinsky lied to the grand jury, or President Clinton lied
to the grand jury.  Under any rational view of the evidence, the
President lied to the grand jury.  

<p>	<u>First</u>, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony about these encounters is
detailed and specific.  She described with precision nine
incidents of sexual activity in which the President touched and
kissed her breasts and four incidents involving contacts with her
genitalia.  

<p>	<u>Second</u>, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has stated repeatedly that she does not
want to hurt the President by her testimony.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a>  Thus, if she had
exaggerated in her many prior statements, she presumably would
have said as much, rather than adhering to those statements.  She
has confirmed those details, however, even though it clearly has
been painful for her to testify to the details of her
relationship with the President. 

<p>	<u>Third</u>, the testimony of many of her friends, family members,
and counselors corroborate her testimony in important detail. 
Many testified that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had told them that the President
had touched her breasts and genitalia during sexual activity. 
These statements were made well before the President's grand jury
testimony rendered these precise details important.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
had no motive to lie to these individuals (and obviously not to
counselors).  Indeed, she pointed out to many of them that she
was upset that sexual intercourse had not occurred, an unlikely
admission if she were exaggerating the sexual aspects of their
relationship.

<p>	<u>Fourth</u>, a computer file obtained from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's home
computer contained a draft letter that referred in one place to
their sexual relationship.  The draft explicitly refers to
"watching your mouth on my breast" and implicitly refers to
direct contact with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's genitalia.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a>  This draft
letter further corroborates Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony and
indicates that the President's grand jury testimony is false.     

<p>	<u>Fifth</u>, as noted above, the President's "hands-off" scenario
-- in which he would have received oral sex on nine occasions
from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky but never made direct contact with Ms.
Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia -- is implausible.  As
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky herself testified, it suggests that she and the
President had some kind of "service contract -- that all I did
was perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship
was."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a>  But as the above descriptions and the Narrative explain,
the nature of the relationship, including the sexual
relationship, was far more than that.  	

<p>	<u>Sixth</u>, in the grand jury, the President had a motive to lie
by denying he had fondled Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in intimate ways.  The
President clearly sought to deny any acts that would show that he
committed perjury in his civil case (implying that the President
understood how seriously the public and the courts would view
perjury in a civil case).  To do that, the President had to deny
touching Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia -- no matter how
implausible his testimony to that effect might be. 

<p>	<u>Seventh</u>, the President refused to answer specific questions
before the grand jury about what activity he did engage in (as
opposed to what activity he did <u>not</u> engage in) -- even though at
the <u>Jones</u> deposition only seven months before, his attorney
stated that he was willing to answer specific questions when
there was a sufficient factual predicate.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_112_"><sup>(112)</sup></a>  The President's
failure in the grand jury to answer specific follow-up questions
suggests that he could not supply responses in a consistent or
credible manner.

<p>	3.  Finally, the President made a third false statement to
the grand jury about his sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.  He contended that the intimate contact did not begin
until 1996.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has testified that it began November
15, 1995, during the government shutdown -- testimony
corroborated by statements she made to friends at the time.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_113_"><sup>(113)</sup></a>  A
White House photograph of the evening shows the President and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky eating pizza.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_114_"><sup>(114)</sup></a>  White House records show that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky did not depart the White House until 12:18 a.m. and
show that the President was in the Oval Office area until 12:35
a.m.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_115_"><sup>(115)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was still an <u>intern</u> when she says the President
began receiving oral sex from her, whereas she was a full-time
employee by the time that the President admits they began an
"inappropriate intimate" relationship.  The motive for the
President to make a false statement about the date on which the
sexual relationship started appears to have been that the
President was unwilling to admit sexual activity with a young 22-year-old White House <u>intern</u> in the Oval Office area.  Indeed,
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that, at that first encounter, the
President tugged at her intern pass.  He said that "this" may be
a problem; Ms. Lewinsky interpreted that statement to reflect his
awareness that there would be a problem with her obtaining access
to the West Wing.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_116_"><sup>(116)</sup></a> 

<p>	For all these reasons, there is substantial and credible
information that the President lied to the grand jury about his
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_117_"><sup>(117)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a name="L44"><strong>III.	There is substantial and credible information that President

Clinton lied under oath during his civil deposition when he
stated that he could not recall being alone with Monica
Lewinsky and when he minimized the number of gifts they had
exchanged.</strong>

<p>>

<p>>The President testified to the grand jury and stated to the
Nation on August 17 that his testimony in his civil deposition
had been "legally accurate."  Even apart from his answers about
the sexual relationship, the President's deposition testimony was
inaccurate on several other points.

<p>	During President Clinton's deposition in the <u>Jones</u> case,
Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys asked the President many detailed questions
about the nature of his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, apart
from whether the relationship was sexual.  The questions
included: (i)&nbsp;whether the President had been alone with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in the White House and, if so, how many times; and
(ii)&nbsp;whether he and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky exchanged gifts.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_118_"><sup>(118)</sup></a>  Both issues
were important in determining the nature of the relationship.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_119_"><sup>(119)</sup></a>

<p>	WJC:	<u>I don't recall</u>, but as I said, when she worked at the
legislative affairs office, they always had somebody
there on the weekends.  I typically worked some on the
weekends.  Sometimes they'd bring me things on the
weekends.  She -- it seems to me she brought things to
me once or twice on the weekends.  In that case,
whatever time she would be in there, drop it off,
exchange a few words and go, she was there.  I don't
have any specific recollections of what the issues
were, what was going on, but when the Congress is
there, we're working all the time, and typically I
would do some work on one of the days of the weekends
in the afternoon.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

you have no specific recollection of that ever

<p>	In the seven months preceding the President's grand jury
testimony on August 17, the OIC gathered substantial and credible
information that the President lied under oath in his deposition
statements about being alone with Monica Lewinsky.

<p>	<u>First</u>, Monica Lewinsky testified before the grand jury that
she was alone with the President on numerous occasions<a href="7grounds.htm#N_125_"><sup>(125)</sup></a> and in
numerous areas, including the Oval Office,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_126_"><sup>(126)</sup></a> Nancy Hernreich's

Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were alone together in the Oval Office area a number
of times.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_132_"><sup>(132)</sup></a>  She specifically remembered three occasions when the

<p>	<u>Third</u>, six current or former members of the Secret Service

Oval Office, saw Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky with a gift, and escorted her into

Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were alone together for approximately eight minutes,
and then Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky left.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_144_"><sup>(144)</sup></a>

<p><a name="L48"><strong>	 3.  The President's Grand Jury Testimony </strong>

<p>	On August 17, 1998, the President testified to the grand
jury and began his testimony by reading a statement admitting
that he had been alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky: 

<p>	<u>When I was alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on certain occasions
in early 1996 and once in early 1997</u>, I engaged in
conduct that was wrong.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_145_"><sup>(145)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The President acknowledged being alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on
multiple occasions, although he could not pinpoint the precise
number.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_146_"><sup>(146)</sup></a>  Perhaps most important, the President admitted that he
was alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on December 28, 1997,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_147_"><sup>(147)</sup></a> <u>less than
three weeks before his deposition in the Jones case</u>.  Indeed, he
acknowledged that he would have to have been an "exhibitionist"
for him not to have been alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky when they were
having sexual encounters.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_148_"><sup>(148)</sup></a>

<p>		<a name="L49"><strong>4.  Summary</strong>

<p>	Substantial and credible information demonstrates that the
President made three false statements under oath in his civil
deposition regarding whether he had been alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 

<p>	<u>First</u>, the President lied when he said "I don't recall" in
response to the question whether he had ever been alone with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  The President admitted to the grand jury that he
had been alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  It is not credible that he
actually had no memory of this fact six months earlier,
particularly given that they were obviously alone when engaging
in sexual activity.

<p>	<u>Second</u>, when asked whether he had been alone with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in the hallway in the Oval Office, the President
answered, "I don't believe so, unless we were walking back to the
back dining room with the pizza."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_149_"><sup>(149)</sup></a>  That statement, too, was
false:  Most of the sexual encounters between the President and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky occurred in that hallway (and on other occasions,
they walked through the hallway to the dining room or study), and
it is not credible that the President would have forgotten this
fact.

<p>	<u>Third</u>, the President suggested at his civil deposition that
he had no specific recollection of being alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
in the Oval Office, but had a general recollection that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky may have brought him "papers to sign" on certain
occasions when she worked at the Legislative Affairs Office.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_150_"><sup>(150)</sup></a> 
This statement was false.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky did not bring him papers
for official purposes.  To the contrary, "bringing papers" was
one of the sham "cover stories" that the President and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had originally crafted to conceal their sexual
relationship.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_151_"><sup>(151)</sup></a>  The fact that the President resorted to a
previously designed cover story when testifying <u>under oath</u> at the
<u>Jones</u>&nbsp;deposition confirms that he made these false denials in a
calculated manner with the intent and knowledge that they were
false.

<p>	The President had an obvious motive to lie in this respect. 
He knew that it would appear odd for a President to have been
alone with a female intern or low-level staffer on so many
occasions.  Such an admission might persuade Judge Wright to deny
any motion by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to quash her deposition subpoena.  It
also might prompt Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys to oppose efforts by
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky not to be deposed and to ask specific questions of
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about the times she was alone with the President. 
It also might raise questions publicly if and when the
President's deposition became public; at least parts of the
deposition were likely to become public at trial, if not at the
summary judgment stage. 

<p>	  Because lying about their sexual relationship was
insufficient to avoid raising further questions, the President
also lied about being alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky -- or at least
feigned lack of memory as to specific occurrences.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_152_"><sup>(152)</sup></a> 

<p><a name="L50"><strong>B.	There is substantial and credible information that the

President lied under oath in his civil deposition about
gifts he exchanged with Monica Lewinsky.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	During his civil deposition, the President also was asked
several questions about gifts he and Monica Lewinsky had
exchanged.  The evidence demonstrates that he answered the
questions falsely.  As with the questions about being alone,
truthful answers to these questions would have raised questions
about the nature of the relationship.  Such answers also would
have been inconsistent with the understanding of the President
and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that, in response to her subpoena, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
would not produce all of the gifts she had received from the
President (an issue discussed more fully in Ground V).

<p>	<a name="L57"><strong>6.  Summary </strong>

<p>	The President stated in his civil deposition that he could
not recall whether he had ever given any gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky;<a href="7grounds.htm#N_199_"><sup>(199)</sup></a>
that he could not remember whether he had given her a hat pin
although "certainly, I could have"; and that he had received a
gift from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky only "once or twice."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_200_"><sup>(200)</sup></a>  In fact, the
evidence demonstrates that they exchanged numerous gifts of
various kinds at many points over a lengthy period of time. 
Indeed, on December 28, only three weeks before the deposition,
they had discussed the hat pin.  Also on December 28, the
President had given Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky a number of gifts, more than he
had ever given her before. 

<p>	A truthful answer to the questions about gifts at the <u>Jones</u>
deposition would have raised further questions about the
President's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.  The number itself
would raise questions about the relationship and prompt further
questions about specific gifts; some of the specific gifts (such
as <u>Vox</u>&nbsp;and <u>Leaves of Grass</u>) would raise questions whether the
relationship was sexual and whether the President had lied in
denying that their relationship was sexual.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
explained the point:  Had they admitted the gifts, it would "at
least prompt [the <u>Jones</u> attorneys] to want to question me about
what kind of friendship I had with the President and they would
want to speculate and they'd leak it and my name would be trashed
and he [the President] would be in trouble."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_201_"><sup>(201)</sup></a>  

<p>	A truthful answer about the gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also would
have raised the question of where they were.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had
been subpoenaed for gifts, as the President knew.  The President
knew also from his conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on December 28,
1997 (an issue discussed more fully in Ground V) that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would not produce all of the gifts she had received
from the President.

<p>	For those reasons, the President had a clear motive when
testifying under oath to lie about the gifts.

<p>		<a name="L62"><strong>(i)  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's Testimony</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she spoke <u>three times</u> to
President Clinton about the prospect of testifying in the <u>Jones</u>
lawsuit -- once (December 17, 1997) after she was on the witness
list and twice more (December 28, 1997, and January 5, 1998)
after she had been subpoenaed.

<p>	a.  <u>December 17, 1997, Call</u>.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that
President Clinton called her at about 2:00 a.m. on December 17,
1997.  First, he told her that Ms.&nbsp;Currie's brother had died;
then he told Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that she was on the witness list in the
<u>Jones</u> case.  According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, "[h]e told me that it
didn't necessarily mean that I would be subpoenaed, but that that
was a possibility, and if I were to be subpoenaed, that I should
contact Betty and let Betty know that I had received the
subpoena."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_203_"><sup>(203)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said that the President told her that
she might be able to sign an affidavit to avoid being deposed.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_204_"><sup>(204)</sup></a> 
According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the President also told her, "<u>You
know, you can always say you were coming to see Betty or that you
were bringing me letters</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_205_"><sup>(205)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky took that statement to
be a reminder of the false "cover stories" that they had used
earlier in the relationship.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_206_"><sup>(206)</sup></a> 

<p>	b.  <u>December 28, 1997, Visit</u>.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was subpoenaed
on December 19.  At her request, Vernon Jordan told the President
that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had been subpoenaed.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_207_"><sup>(207)</sup></a>  She then met with
President Clinton nine days later on December 28, less than three
weeks before the President was deposed.  

<p>	According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, she and the President discussed
the <u>Jones</u> lawsuit and how the <u>Jones</u> lawyers might have learned
about her.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said they also discussed the subpoena's
requirement that she produce gifts she had received from the
President, including specifically a "hat pin."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_208_"><sup>(208)</sup></a>

<p>	Because of their mutual concern about the subpoena,
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she asked the President if she should
put the gifts away somewhere.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_209_"><sup>(209)</sup></a>  The President responded "I don't
know" or "Hmm" or "Let me think about it."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_210_"><sup>(210)</sup></a>  Later that day,
according to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, Ms.&nbsp;Currie called to pick up the
gifts, which she then stored under her bed in her home in
Virginia.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_211_"><sup>(211)</sup></a>  (This issue will be discussed more fully in Ground&nbsp;V
below.) 

<p>	c.  <u>January 5, 1998, Call</u>.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also testified that
she spoke to the President by telephone on January 5, 1998, and
they continued to discuss her role in the <u>Jones</u> case.  Ms.
Lewinsky expressed concern that, if she were deposed, she might
have a difficult time explaining the circumstances of her
transfer from the White House to the Pentagon.  According to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the President suggested that she answer by
explaining that people in the White House Legislative Affairs
office had helped her get the Pentagon job -- which Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
understood to be a misleading answer because she in fact had been
transferred as a result of her being around the Oval Office too
much.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_212_"><sup>(212)</sup></a>

<p>	<a name="L63"><strong>	(ii)  The President's Grand Jury Testimony</strong>

<p>			<u>She raised the issue with me in the context

certainly understood; not only because there were
some embarrassing facts about our relationship
that were inappropriate, but also because a whole

dragged through the mud by these Jones lawyers

<p>	There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton lied under oath in his civil deposition in answering "I'm
not sure" when asked whether he had talked to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about
the prospect of her testifying.  In fact, he had talked to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about it on three occasions in the month preceding
his civil deposition, as Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony makes clear. 

<p>	The President's motive to lie in his civil deposition on
this point is evident.  Had he admitted talking to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
about the possibility that she might be asked to testify, that
would have raised the specter of witness tampering.  Such an
admission likely would have led Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys to inquire
further into that subject with both the President and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  Furthermore, had the President admitted talking to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about her testifying, that conversation would have
attracted public inquiry into the conversation and the general
relationship between the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.

<p>	In his civil deposition, President Clinton testified that
the last time he had spoken to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was in December 1997
(the month before the deposition), "[p]robably sometime before
Christmas."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_217_"><sup>(217)</sup></a>  The President was asked:

<p>	Q:	Did [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky] tell you she had been served with a
subpoena in this case?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:  No.  <u>I don't know if she had been</u>.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_218_"><sup>(218)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Vernon Jordan testified that he had told the President about
the subpoena on December 19, 1997, after he had talked to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky confirmed that Mr.&nbsp;Jordan had told
her on December 22, 1997, that he (Mr.&nbsp;Jordan) had told the
President of her subpoena.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_219_"><sup>(219)</sup></a>  	

<p>	When he testified to the grand jury, the President stated
that in his conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on December 28, 1997,
"my recollection is <u>I knew by then, of course, that she had
gotten a subpoena</u>.  And I knew that she was, therefore, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
slated to testify."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_220_"><sup>(220)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President had two
conversations after she was subpoenaed: the December 28, 1997,
meeting and a January 5, 1998, phone conversation.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_221_"><sup>(221)</sup></a> 

<p>	<a name="L67"><strong>2.  Summary</strong>

<p>	There is substantial and credible information that the
President lied under oath in his civil deposition by answering "I
don't know if she had been" subpoenaed when describing his last
conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  In fact, he knew that she had
been subpoenaed.  Given that the conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
occurred in the few weeks immediately before the President's
civil deposition, he could not have forgotten the conversation. 
As a result, there is no plausible conclusion except that the
President intentionally lied in this answer.

<p>	During the civil deposition, the President also falsely
dated his last conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky as "probably
sometime before Christmas," which implied that it might have been
before the December 19 subpoena.  Because Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had been
subpoenaed on December 19, that false statement about the date of
the conversation was a corollary to his other false statement
(that he did not know she had been subpoenaed at the time of
their last conversation).

<p>	The President's motive to lie in his civil deposition on the
subpoena issue is evident.  Had he admitted talking to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky <u>after</u> her subpoena, that would have raised the
specter of witness tampering, which could have triggered legal
and public scrutiny of the President.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a name="L69"><strong>		(i)	concealment of gifts that the President had

<p><em>	</em>From the beginning, President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
hoped and expected that their relationship would remain secret. 
They took active steps, when necessary, to conceal the

relationship would never become public."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_222_"><sup>(222)</sup></a> 

<p>	Once the discovery process in the <u>Jones</u> case became an issue
(particularly after the Supreme Court's unanimous decision on May
27, 1997, that ordered the case to go forward), their continuing
efforts to conceal the relationship took on added legal
significance.  The risks to the President of disclosure of the
relationship dramatically increased. 

<p>	An effort to obstruct justice by withholding the truth from
the legal process -- whether by lying under oath, concealing
documents, or improperly influencing a witness's testimony -- is
a federal crime.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_223_"><sup>(223)</sup></a>  There is substantial and credible information

17, at roughly 2:00 or 2:30&nbsp;a.m., she received a call from the
President.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_224_"><sup>(224)</sup></a>  Among other subjects, the President mentioned that
he had Christmas presents for her.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_225_"><sup>(225)</sup></a> 

<p>	On December 19, 1997, Monica Lewinsky was served with a
subpoena in connection with the <u>Jones v. Clinton</u>&nbsp;litigation.  The
subpoena required her to testify at a deposition on January 23,
1998.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_226_"><sup>(226)</sup></a>  The subpoena also required Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to produce "each
and every gift including, but not limited to, any and all
dresses, accessories, and jewelry, and/or hat pins given to you
by, or on behalf of, Defendant Clinton."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_227_"><sup>(227)</sup></a>  After being served
with the subpoena, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky became concerned because the list
of gifts included the hat pin, which "screamed out at me because
that was the first gift that the President had given me."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_228_"><sup>(228)</sup></a> 

<p>	Later that same day, December 19, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met
with Vernon Jordan and told him of her concern about the gifts,
including the hat pin.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_229_"><sup>(229)</sup></a>  During that meeting, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky asked
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan to inform the President that she had been
subpoenaed.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_230_"><sup>(230)</sup></a>  Mr.&nbsp;Jordan acknowledged that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "was
concerned about the subpoena and I think for her the subpoena
ipso facto meant trouble."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_231_"><sup>(231)</sup></a> 

<p>	Shortly after Christmas, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky called Ms.&nbsp;Currie and
said that the President had mentioned that he had presents for
her.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_232_"><sup>(232)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Currie called back and told her to come to the White
House at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday, December 28, 1997.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_233_"><sup>(233)</sup></a>  On December
28, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and the President met in the Oval Office. 
According to her testimony, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "mentioned that [she]
had been concerned about the hat pin being on the subpoena and he
said that that had sort of concerned him also and asked [her] if
[she] had told anyone that he had given [her] this hat pin and
[she] said no."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_234_"><sup>(234)</sup></a>  According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, she and the
President discussed the possibility of moving some of the gifts
out of her possession:

<p>	[A]t some point I said to him, "Well, you know, should
I -- maybe I should put the gifts away outside my house
somewhere or give them to someone, maybe Betty."  And
he sort of said -- I think he responded, "I don't know"
or "Let me think about that."  And [we] left that
topic.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_235_"><sup>(235)</sup></a>

<p>	

<p>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she was never under the impression
from anything the President said that she should turn over to Ms.
Jones's attorneys all the gifts that he had given her.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_236_"><sup>(236)</sup></a>

<p>	On the 28th, the President also gave Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky several
Christmas gifts.  When asked why the President gave her more
gifts on December 28 when he understood she was under an
obligation to produce gifts in response to the subpoena,
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated:

<p>	You know, I can't answer what [the President] was
thinking, but to me, it was -- there was never a
question in my mind and I -- <u>from everything he said to
me</u>, I never questioned him, that we were never going to
do anything but keep this private, so that meant deny
it and that meant do -- take whatever appropriate steps
needed to be taken, you know, for that to happen
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  So by turning over all these gifts, it would
at least prompt [the <u>Jones</u> attorneys] to want to
question me about what kind of friendship I had with
the President and they would want to speculate and
they'd leak it and my name would be trashed and he [the
President] would be in trouble.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_237_"><sup>(237)</sup></a>	

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that a few hours after their meeting
on December 28, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Currie called her.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_238_"><sup>(238)</sup></a>  According to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, Ms.&nbsp;Currie said: "'I understand you have something
to give me.' Or, 'The President said you have something to give
me' -- [Something] [a]long those lines."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_239_"><sup>(239)</sup></a>  In her February 1
handwritten statement to the OIC, which Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has
testified was truthful, she stated:  "Ms.&nbsp;Currie called Ms.&nbsp;L
later that afternoon a[nd] said that <u>the Pres. had told her</u>
[that] Ms.&nbsp;L wanted her to hold onto something for her.  Ms.&nbsp;L
boxed up most of the gifts she had received and gave them to
Ms.&nbsp;Currie."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_240_"><sup>(240)</sup></a>  

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she understood that Ms.&nbsp;Currie
was referring to gifts from the President when she mentioned
"something for me."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_241_"><sup>(241)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she was not
surprised to receive the call, given her earlier discussion with
the President.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_242_"><sup>(242)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Currie testified that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, not Ms.&nbsp;Currie,
placed the call and raised the subject of transferring the gifts. 
In Ms.&nbsp;Currie's account, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said that she
(Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky) was uncomfortable retaining the gifts herself
because "people were asking questions about the stuff she had
gotten."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_243_"><sup>(243)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Currie also testified that she did not remember
the President telling her that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky wanted her to hold
some items, and she did not remember later telling the President
that she was holding the gifts for Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_244_"><sup>(244)</sup></a>  When asked if
a contrary statement by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky -- indicating that
Ms.&nbsp;Currie had in fact spoken to the President about the gift
transfer -- would be false, Ms.&nbsp;Currie replied:  "<u>Then she may
remember better than I.  I don't remember</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_245_"><sup>(245)</sup></a>

<p>	According to both Ms.&nbsp;Currie and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, Ms.&nbsp;Currie
drove to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's home later on December 28 for only the
second time in her life.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_246_"><sup>(246)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky gave her a sealed box
that contained several gifts Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had received from the
President, including the hat pin and one of the gifts he had
given her that very morning.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_247_"><sup>(247)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky wrote "Please do not
throw away" on the box.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_248_"><sup>(248)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Currie then took the box and
placed it in her home under her bed.  Ms.&nbsp;Currie understood that
the box contained gifts from the President, although she did not
know the specific contents.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_249_"><sup>(249)</sup></a>  Ms. Lewinsky said that Ms. Currie
did not seem at all confused when Ms. Lewinsky handed over the
box of gifts<a href="7grounds.htm#N_250_"><sup>(250)</sup></a> and never asked about the contents.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_251_"><sup>(251)</sup></a> 

<p>	When Ms.&nbsp;Currie later produced the box to the OIC in
response to a subpoena, the box contained a hat pin, two
brooches, an inscribed official copy of the 1996 State of the
Union Address, a photograph of the President in the Oval Office,
an inscribed photograph of the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, a sun
dress, two t-shirts, and a baseball cap with a Black Dog logo.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_252_"><sup>(252)</sup></a>

<p><a name="L74"><strong>	2.  The President's Grand Jury Testimony</strong>

<p>	President Clinton testified that he had spoken to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about gifts he had given her, but said the
conversation may have occurred <u>before</u> she received the subpoena
on December 19.  He testified:  

<p>	<u>I did have a conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky at some
time about gifts, the gifts I'd given her.</u>  I do not
know whether it occurred on the 28th, or whether it
occurred earlier.  I do not know whether it occurred in
person or whether it occurred on the telephone.  I have
searched my memory for this, because I know it's an
important issue.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  The reason I'm not sure it
happened on the 28th is that my recollection is that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said something to me like, what if they
ask me about the gifts you've given me.  That's the
memory I have.  That's why I question whether it
happened on the 28th, because she had a subpoena with
her, request for production.  <u>And I told her that if
they asked her for gifts, she'd have to give them

<p><a name="L75"><strong>	3.  Summary of Gifts</strong>

<p>	The uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that the President
had given gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky before December 28, 1997; that
the President told Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on the phone on December 17,
1997, that he had more gifts for her; that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met with
the President at the White House on December 28; that on the
28th, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was concerned about retaining possession of
the gifts the President had previously given her because they
were under subpoena; that on the 28th, the President gave several
Christmas gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky; and that after that meeting,
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky transferred some gifts (including one of the new
gifts) to the President's personal secretary, Ms.&nbsp;Currie, who
stored them under her bed in her home.

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she spoke to the President on
December 28 about the gifts called for by the subpoena -- in
particular, the hat pin.  The President agreed that they talked
about gifts, but suggested that the conversation might have taken
place before Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was subpoenaed on December 19.  The
President said, however, that his memory is unclear on the
timing.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_256_"><sup>(256)</sup></a>

<p>	The testimony conflicts as to what happened when
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky raised the subject of gifts with the President and
what happened later that day.  The President testified that he
told Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that "you have to give them whatever you
have."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_257_"><sup>(257)</sup></a>  According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, she raised the possibility
of hiding the gifts, and the President offered a somewhat neutral
response.

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that Betty Currie called her to
retrieve the gifts soon after Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's conversation with
the President.  Ms.&nbsp;Currie says that she believes that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky called her about the gifts, but she says she has a
dim memory of the events.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_258_"><sup>(258)</sup></a>

<p>	The central factual question is whether the President
orchestrated or approved the concealment of the gifts.  The
reasonable inference from the evidence is that he did. 

<p>	1.  The witnesses disagree about whether Ms.&nbsp;Currie called
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky or Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky called Ms.&nbsp;Currie.  That issue is
relevant because Ms.&nbsp;Currie would not have called Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
about the gifts unless the President directed her to do so. 
Indeed, because she did not know of the gifts issue, there is no
other way that Ms.&nbsp;Currie could have known to make such a call
unless the President told her to do so.

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony on the issue is consistent and
unequivocal.  In her February 1, 1998, handwritten statement, she
wrote:  "Ms.&nbsp;Currie called Ms.&nbsp;L later that afternoon a[nd] said
that <u>the Pres. had told her</u> Ms.&nbsp;L wanted her to hold onto
something for her."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_259_"><sup>(259)</sup></a>  In her grand jury testimony, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
said that several hours after she left the White House,
Ms.&nbsp;Currie called and said something along the lines of "The
President said you have something to give me."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_260_"><sup>(260)</sup></a> 

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Currie's testimony is contrary but less clear. 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie has stated that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky called her, but her
memory of the conversation, in contrast to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's,
generally has been hazy and uncertain.  As to whether she had
talked to the President about the gifts, for example, Ms.&nbsp;Currie
initially said she had not, but then said that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky (who
said that Ms.&nbsp;Currie <u>had</u> talked to the President) "may remember
better than I.  I don't remember."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_261_"><sup>(261)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony makes more sense than Ms.&nbsp;Currie's
testimony.  First, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated that if Ms.&nbsp;Currie had not
called, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky simply would have kept the gifts (and
perhaps thrown them away).<a href="7grounds.htm#N_262_"><sup>(262)</sup></a>  She would not have produced the
gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys.  And she would <u>not</u> have given
them to a friend or mother because she did not want to get anyone
else involved.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_263_"><sup>(263)</sup></a>  She was not looking for someone else to take
them.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_264_"><sup>(264)</sup></a>

<p>	Also, Ms.&nbsp;Currie drove to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's house to pick up
the gifts.  That was only the second time that Ms.&nbsp;Currie had
ever gone there.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_265_"><sup>(265)</sup></a>  More generally, the person making the extra
effort (in this case, Ms.&nbsp;Currie) is ordinarily the person
requesting the favor.	

<p>	2.  Even if Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky is mistaken and she did call
Ms.&nbsp;Currie first, the evidence still leads clearly to the
conclusion that the President orchestrated this transfer. 

<p>	<u>First</u>, it is unlikely that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would have involved
Ms.&nbsp;Currie in this matter unless the President had indicated his
assent when Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky raised the issue with him earlier in the
day.  Indeed, there is a logical flaw in the President's story: 
If the President had truly suggested that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky produce
the gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky obviously would
not have turned around and called the President's personal
secretary to give the gifts to her, in direct contravention of
the President's instruction.

<p>	<u>Second</u>, it also is unlikely that Ms.&nbsp;Currie would have
driven to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's home, retrieved the gifts from
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, and stored them under her bed at home without being
asked to do so by the President -- at least, without checking
with him.  It would have been out of character for Ms.&nbsp;Currie to
have taken such an action without the President's approval.  For
example, when helping Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in her job search, Ms.&nbsp;Currie
said that she told the President of her plans and agreed that she
"would not have tried to get Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky a job if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [I]
thought the President didn't want [me] to."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_266_"><sup>(266)</sup></a> 

<p>	3.  Even if the President did not orchestrate the <u>transfer</u>
to Ms.&nbsp;Currie, there is still substantial evidence that he
encouraged the <u>concealment</u> and <u>non-production</u> of the gifts by
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  The President "hoped that this relationship would
never become public."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_267_"><sup>(267)</sup></a>  The President gave Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky new
gifts on December 28, 1997.  Given his desire to conceal the
relationship, it makes no sense that the President would have
given Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky more gifts on the 28th unless he and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky understood that she would <u>not</u> produce all of her
gifts in response to her subpoena. 

<p>	4.  The President had a motive to orchestrate the
concealment of gifts, whether accomplished through Ms.&nbsp;Currie
indirectly or through Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky directly.  The President knew
that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was concerned about the subpoena.  Both of them
were concerned that the gifts might raise questions about the
relationship.  By confirming that the gifts would not be
produced, the President ensured that these questions would not
arise. 

<p>	The concealment of the gifts also ensured that the President
could provide false and misleading statements about the gifts
under oath at his deposition (as he did) without being concerned
that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky might have produced gifts that the President
was denying (or minimizing the number of).  If Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had
produced to Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys all of the gifts that she had
given to Ms.&nbsp;Currie, then the President could not plausibly have
said "I don't recall" in response to the question, "[H]ave you
ever given any gifts to Monica Lewinsky?"  He could not have
said, "I don't remember a specific gift."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_268_"><sup>(268)</sup></a>  Indeed, unless the
President knew that Ms. Lewinsky had not complied with the
subpoena, it is unlikely he would have risked lying about the
number and nature of the gifts he had given her.

<p>	In analyzing the evidence on this issue, it also bears
mention that President Clinton likely operated no differently
with respect to the gifts than he did with respect to testimony. 
It is clear that he lied under oath and that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky filed a
false affidavit after the President suggested she file an
affidavit.  So there is little reason that he would not have
attempted to ensure (whether directly or subtly) that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky conceal the gifts as a corollary to their mutual
lies under oath.  (Also, it was the President's pattern to use
Ms.&nbsp;Currie as an intermediary in dealing with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_269_"><sup>(269)</sup></a>)   

<p>	The President's apparent response to all of this is that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky <u>on her own</u> contacted Ms.&nbsp;Currie and involved her in
this endeavor to hide subpoenaed evidence, and that Ms.&nbsp;Currie
complied without checking with the President.  Based on the
testimony and behavior of both Ms.&nbsp;Currie and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, those
inferences fall outside the range of reasonable possibility.  

<p>	There is substantial and credible information, therefore,
that the President endeavored to obstruct justice by
participating in the concealment of subpoenaed evidence.

<p><a name="L77"><strong>	1.  Evidence Regarding the January 5, 1998 Note</strong>

<p>	On December 16, 1997, the President was served by
Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys with a request for production of documents,
including documents relating to "Monica Lewisky" [sic].  The
request placed upon the President a continuing obligation to
preserve and produce responsive documents.  Notes and letters
from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were responsive and relevant.

<p>	On January 4, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky left a book for the
President with Ms.&nbsp;Currie.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_270_"><sup>(270)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had enclosed in the
book a romantic note that she had written, inspired by a recent
viewing of the movie <u>Titanic</u>.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_271_"><sup>(271)</sup></a>  In the note, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky told
the President that she wanted to have sexual intercourse with
him, at least once.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_272_"><sup>(272)</sup></a>

<p>	On January 5, in the course of discussing her affidavit and
possible testimony in a phone conversation with the President,
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky says she told the President, "I shouldn't have
written some of those things in the note."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_273_"><sup>(273)</sup></a>  According to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the President said that he agreed and that she
should not write those kinds of things on paper.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_274_"><sup>(274)</sup></a>

<p>	On January 15, President Clinton served responses to
Ms.&nbsp;Jones's second set of document requests, which again asked
for documents that related to "Monica Lewisky."  The President
stated that he had "no documents" responsive to this request.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_275_"><sup>(275)</sup></a> 

<p><a name="L78"><strong>	2.  President Clinton's Testimony</strong>

<p><a name="L79"><strong>	3.  Summary on January 5, 1998, Note</strong>

<p>	The request for production of documents that the President
received from Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys called for all documents
reflecting communications between him and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  The note
given to him by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on January 5, 1998, fell within that
category and would have been revealing about the relationship. 
Indeed, had the note been produced, the President might have been
foreclosed from denying a sexual relationship at his deposition. 
Based on Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony, there is substantial and
credible information that the President concealed or destroyed

<p><a name="L83"><strong>A.  Evidence Regarding Affidavit and Use of Affidavit </strong> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Monica Lewinsky testified that President Clinton called her
at around 2:00 or 2:30 a.m. on December 17, 1997,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_279_"><sup>(279)</sup></a> and told her
that her name was on the <u>Jones</u> case witness list.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_280_"><sup>(280)</sup></a>  As noted in
her February 1 handwritten statement:  "When asked what to do if
she was subpoenaed, the Pres. suggested she could sign an
affidavit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_281_"><sup>(281)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said she is "100% sure" that
the President suggested that she might want to sign an
affidavit.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_282_"><sup>(282)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky understood the President's advice to mean that
she might be able to execute an affidavit that would not disclose
the true nature of their relationship.  In order "to prevent me
from being deposed," she said she would need an affidavit that
"could range from anywhere between maybe just somehow mentioning,
you know, innocuous things or going as far as maybe having to
deny any kind of relationship."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_283_"><sup>(283)</sup></a>  

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has stated that the President never <u>explicitly</u>
told her to lie.  Instead, as she explained, they both understood
from their conversations that they would continue their pattern
of covering up and lying about the relationship.  In that regard,
the President never said they must now tell the truth under oath;
to the contrary, as Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated:

<p>	[I]t wasn't as if the President called me and said,
"You know, Monica, you're on the witness list, this is
going to be really hard for us, we're going to have to
tell the truth and be humiliated in front of the entire
world about what we've done," which I would have fought
him on probably.  <u>That was different.  And by him not
calling me and saying that, you know, I knew what that
meant.</u><a href="7grounds.htm#N_284_"><sup>(284)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Jones's lawyers served Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky with a subpoena on
December 19, 1997.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky contacted Vernon Jordan, who in
turn put her in contact with attorney Frank Carter.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_285_"><sup>(285)</sup></a>  Based on
the information that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky provided, Mr.&nbsp;Carter prepared
an affidavit which stated:  "I have never had a sexual
relationship with the President."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_286_"><sup>(286)</sup></a> 

<p>	After Mr.&nbsp;Carter drafted the affidavit, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky spoke
to the President by phone on January 5th.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_287_"><sup>(287)</sup></a>  She asked the
President if he wanted to see the draft affidavit.  According to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the President replied that he did not need to see
it because he had already "seen 15 others."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_288_"><sup>(288)</sup></a>

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Jordan confirmed that President Clinton knew that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky planned to execute an affidavit denying a sexual
relationship.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_289_"><sup>(289)</sup></a>  Mr.&nbsp;Jordan further testified that he informed
President Clinton when Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky signed the affidavit.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_290_"><sup>(290)</sup></a> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit was sent to the federal court in
Arkansas on January 16, 1998 -- the day before the President's
deposition -- as part of her motion to quash the deposition
subpoena.

<p>	Two days before the President's deposition, his lawyer,
Robert Bennett, obtained a copy of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit from
Mr.&nbsp;Carter.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_291_"><sup>(291)</sup></a>  At the President's deposition, Ms.&nbsp;Jones's counsel
asked questions about the President's relationship with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  Mr.&nbsp;Bennett objected to the "innuendo" of the
questions, noting that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had signed an affidavit
denying a sexual relationship, which according to Mr.&nbsp;Bennett,
indicated that "<u>there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any 
manner, shape or form</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_292_"><sup>(292)</sup></a>  Mr.&nbsp;Bennett said that the President
was "fully aware of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_293_"><sup>(293)</sup></a>  Mr.&nbsp;Bennett
affirmatively used the affidavit in an effort to cut off
questioning.  The President said nothing -- even though, as he
knew, the affidavit was false.  Judge Wright overruled the
objection and allowed the questioning to continue. 

<p>	Later, Mr.&nbsp;Bennett read Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit denying a
"sexual relationship" to the President and asked him:  "Is that a
true and accurate statement as far as you know it?"  The
President answered:  "<u>That is absolutely true</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_294_"><sup>(294)</sup></a>  

<p><a name="L84"><strong>B.	Summary of President's Grand Jury Testimony</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The President told the grand jury: "[D]id I hope
[Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would] be able to get out of testifying on an
affidavit?  Absolutely.  Did I want her to execute a false
affidavit?  No, I did not."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_295_"><sup>(295)</sup></a>  The President did not explain how
a full and truthful affidavit -- for example, an affidavit
admitting that they engaged in oral sex and that Vernon Jordan
had been involved, at the President's request, in late 1997 and
early 1998 in obtaining Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky a job -- would have helped
her avoid a deposition.   

<p>	When questioned about his phone conversation with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on December 17, 1997 -- during which the President
suggested filing an affidavit -- the President testified that he
did not remember exactly what he had said.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_296_"><sup>(296)</sup></a>  The President also
maintained that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit, as it ultimately was
filed denying a "sexual relationship," was not necessarily
inaccurate.  He testified that, depending on Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's state
of mind, her statement denying a sexual relationship could have
been true.

<p>	I believe at the time that she filled out this
affidavit, <u>if she believed that the definition of
sexual relationship was two people having intercourse,
then this is accurate.  And I believe that is the
definition that most ordinary Americans would give
it</u>.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_297_"><sup>(297)</sup></a>

<p>	

<p>	At his grand jury appearance, the President also was asked
about his counsel's statement to Judge Wright that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's
affidavit denying a "sexual relationship" was equivalent to
saying "there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner,
shape or form" with President Clinton.  Given the President's
interpretation of the term "sexual relationship" to require
sexual intercourse, the President was asked how he lawfully could
have sat silent while his attorney -- in the President's presence
and on his behalf -- made a false statement to a United States
District Judge in an effort to forestall further questioning. 
The President offered several responses.

<p>	First, the President maintained that he was not paying "much
attention" when Mr.&nbsp;Bennett said that there is "absolutely no sex
of any kind" between the President and Ms. Lewinsky."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_298_"><sup>(298)</sup></a>  The
President further stated:  "That moment, that whole argument just
passed me by.  I was a witness."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_299_"><sup>(299)</sup></a>  The President's explanation
is difficult to reconcile with the videotape of the deposition,
which shows that the President was looking in Mr.&nbsp;Bennett's
direction when his counsel made this statement. 

<p>	Alternatively, the President contended that when Mr.&nbsp;Bennett
said that "there <u>is</u> absolutely no sex of any kind," Mr.&nbsp;Bennett
was speaking only in the present tense and thus was making a
completely true statement.  The President further stated:  <u>"It
depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is</u>,"<a href="7grounds.htm#N_300_"><sup>(300)</sup></a> and that
"actually, in the present tense that is an accurate statement."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_301_"><sup>(301)</sup></a> 
Before the grand jury, counsel for the OIC then asked the
President:  "Do you mean today that because you were not engaging
in sexual activity with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky during the deposition that
the statement of Mr.&nbsp;Bennett might be literally true?"<a href="7grounds.htm#N_302_"><sup>(302)</sup></a>  The
President responded:  "No, sir.  I mean that at the time of the
deposition, it had been -- that was well beyond any point of
improper contact between me and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_303_"><sup>(303)</sup></a>  The President's
suggestion that he might have engaged in such a detailed parsing
of the words at his deposition is at odds with his assertion that
the "whole argument passed me by."

<p>	Finally, the President took issue with the notion that he
had any duty to prevent his attorney from making a false
statement to Judge Wright:  "Mr.&nbsp;Bennett was representing me.  I
wasn't representing him."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_304_"><sup>(304)</sup></a>  That is a truism.  Yet when a
witness is knowingly responsible for a misstatement of fact to a
federal judge that misleads the Court and attempts to prevent
questioning on a relevant subject, that conduct rises to the
level of an obstruction of justice.  

<p><a name="L85"><strong>C.  Evidence Regarding Cover Stories</strong>

<p>	The affidavit was not the only part of the scheme in which
both the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would lie under oath. 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that, as part of their mutual concealment
efforts, she and President Clinton formulated "cover stories" to
explain Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's presence in the West Wing and Oval Office. 
When Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky worked at the White House, she and the
President agreed that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would tell people that she was
coming to the Oval Office to deliver papers or to have papers
signed, when in truth she was going to the Oval Office to have a
sexual encounter with the President.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_305_"><sup>(305)</sup></a>

<p>	While employed at the White House, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky used this
cover story on several occasions.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_306_"><sup>(306)</sup></a>  It worked:  Several Secret
Service officers testified that they understood that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
was at the Oval Office to deliver or to pick up papers.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_307_"><sup>(307)</sup></a>  In
fact, however, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated that her White House job never
required her to deliver papers or obtain the President's
signature, although she carried papers as a prop.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_308_"><sup>(308)</sup></a>  

<p>	After she was transferred to the Pentagon, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
testified that she and the President formulated a second "cover
story": that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was going to the White House to visit
Betty Currie rather than the President.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified
that she and the President discussed how "Betty always needed to
be the one to clear me in so that, you know, I could always say I
was coming to see Betty."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_309_"><sup>(309)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she met
with the President privately on ten occasions after she left her
job at the White House.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_310_"><sup>(310)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Currie signed her in for each of
those private visits.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_311_"><sup>(311)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has stated that her true purpose in visiting
the White House on these occasions was to see President Clinton,
not Ms.&nbsp;Currie.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_312_"><sup>(312)</sup></a>  President Clinton agreed that "just about
every time" that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky came to see Ms.&nbsp;Currie when he was
there, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky saw him as well.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_313_"><sup>(313)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that President Clinton encouraged her
to continue to use the cover stories to conceal their
relationship <u>after</u> her name appeared on the witness list in the
<u>Jones</u> case.  In her early-morning phone conversation with
President Clinton on December 17, 1997 -- the same conversation
in which the President told her that her name was on the witness
list and suggested that she file an affidavit if subpoenaed<a href="7grounds.htm#N_314_"><sup>(314)</sup></a> -- 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky discussed cover stories with the President: 

<p>	ML:	At some point in the conversation, and I don't
know if it was before or after the subject of the
affidavit came up, he sort of said, <u>"You know, you
can always say you were coming to see Betty or
that you were bringing me letters."  Which I
understood was really a reminder of things that we
had discussed before.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	So when you say things you had discussed, sort of
ruses that you had developed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	ML:	Right.  I mean, this was -- this was something
that -- that was instantly familiar to me.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	Right.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	ML:	<u>And I knew exactly what he meant.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	Had you talked with him earlier about these false
explanations about what you were doing visiting
him on several occasions?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	ML:	Several occasions throughout the entire
relationship.  Yes.  <u>It was the pattern of the
relationship, to sort of conceal it</u>.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_315_"><sup>(315)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	President Clinton used those same deceptive cover stories
during his deposition in the <u>Jones</u> case.  In the civil
deposition, when asked if he had met with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "several
times" while she worked at the White House, the President
responded that he had seen her on two or three occasions during
the government shutdown, "and then when she worked at the White
House, I think there was one or two other times <u>when she brought
some documents to me</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_316_"><sup>(316)</sup></a>  When asked if he was ever alone with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in the Oval Office, the President stated:

<p>	[W]hen she worked at the legislative affairs office,
they always had somebody there on the weekends.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<u>Sometimes they'd bring me things on the weekends</u>.  In
that case, whatever time she would be in there, drop it
off, exchange a few words and go, she was there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
It's possible that she, in, while she was working
there, brought something to me and that at the time she
brought it to me, she was the only person there, 
That's possible.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_317_"><sup>(317)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The pattern of devising cover stories in an effort to
forestall an inquiry into the relationship continued even after
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was subpoenaed to testify.  On January 5, 1998, she
met with her attorney, Frank Carter, and discussed questions that
she might be asked at a deposition.  One of the questions was how
she had obtained her Pentagon job.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky worried that if
the <u>Jones</u> lawyers checked with the White House about the
transfer, some at the White House would say unflattering things
about why she had been terminated.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_318_"><sup>(318)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky spoke to
President Clinton on the phone that evening and asked for advice
on how to answer the question.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that the
President responded, "<u>[Y]ou could always say</u> that the people in
Legislative Affairs got it for you or helped you get it" -- a
story that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated was misleading because
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in fact had been transferred because she was around
the Oval Office too much.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_319_"><sup>(319)</sup></a>  President Clinton knew the truth. 

<p><a name="L86"><strong>D.	The President's Grand Jury Testimony on Cover Stories</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The President testified that <u>before</u> he knew that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was a witness in the <u>Jones</u> case, he "might well"
have told Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that she could offer the cover stories if
questioned about her presence in the West Wing and Oval Office:

<p>	Q:	Did you ever say anything like that, you can
always say that you were coming to see Betty or
bringing me letters?  Was that part of any kind of
a, anything you said to her or a cover story,
before you had any idea she was going to be part
of Paula Jones?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	I might well have said that.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	Okay.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	Because I certainly didn't want this to come out,
if I could help it.  And I was concerned about
that.  I was embarrassed about it.  I knew it was
wrong.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_320_"><sup>(320)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	However, no doubt aware of the significance of the question,
the President testified that he did not remember whether he had
discussed the cover stories with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky during the December
17, 1997, conversation,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_321_"><sup>(321)</sup></a> or at any time <u>after</u> Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's
name appeared on the <u>Jones</u> witness list:

<p>	Q:	Did you tell [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky] anytime in December
something to that effect:  You know, you can
always say that you were coming to see Betty or
you were bringing me letters?  Did you say that,
or anything like that, in December '97 or January
'98, to Monica Lewinsky?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	Well, that's a very broad question.  I do not
recall saying anything like that <u>in connection
with her testimony</u>.  I could tell you what I do
remember saying, if you want to know.  But I don't
-- we might have talked about what to do in a
nonlegal context at some point in the past, but I
have no specific memory of that conversation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		I do remember what I said to her about the
possible testimony.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			* * * *

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	Did you say anything like [the cover stories] once
you knew or thought she might be a witness in the
Jones case?  Did you repeat the statement, or
something like it to her?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>Well, again, I don't recall, and I don't recall
whether I might have done something like that, for
example, if somebody says, what if the reporters
ask me this, that or the other thing</u>.  I can tell
you this: In the context of whether she could be a
witness, I have a recollection that she asked me,
well, what do I do if I get called as a witness,
and I said, you have to get a lawyer.  And that's
all I said.  And I never asked her to lie.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	Did you tell her to tell the truth?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	Well, I think the implication was she would tell the
truth.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_322_"><sup>(322)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a name="L87"><strong>E.  Summary</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	There is substantial and credible information that the
President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky reached an understanding that both of
them would lie under oath when asked whether they had a sexual
relationship (a conspiracy to obstruct justice or to commit
perjury, in criminal law terms).  Indeed, a tacit or express
agreement to make false statements would have been an essential
part of their December and January discussions, lest one of the
two testify truthfully in the <u>Jones</u> case and thereby incriminate
the other as a perjurer.  

<p>	There also is substantial and credible information that
President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by suggesting
that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky file an affidavit to avoid her deposition,
which would "lock in" her testimony under oath, and to attempt to
avoid questions at his own deposition -- all to impede the
gathering of discoverable evidence in the <u>Jones v. Clinton</u>
litigation.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_323_"><sup>(323)</sup></a> 

<p>	During the course of their relationship, the President and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also discussed and used cover stories to justify her
presence in and around the Oval Office area.  The evidence
indicates -- given Ms. Lewinsky's unambiguous testimony and the
President's lack of memory, as well as the fact that they both
planned to lie under oath -- that the President suggested the
continued use of the cover stories even after Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was
named as a potential witness in the <u>Jones</u> litigation.  At no time
did the President tell Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to abandon these stories and
to tell the truth about her visits, nor did he ever indicate to
her that she should tell the truth under oath about the
relationship.  While the President testified that he could not
remember such conversations about the cover stories, he had
repeated the substance of the cover stories in his <u>Jones</u>
deposition.  The President's use of false cover stories in
testimony <u>under oath</u> in his <u>Jones</u> deposition strongly
corroborates Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony that he suggested them to
her on December 17 as a means of avoiding disclosure of the truth
of their relationship.  

<p><a name="L88"><strong>VII.	There is substantial and credible information that President

Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by helping
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky obtain a job in New York at a time when she
would have been a witness against him were she to tell the
truth during the <u>Jones</u> case.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The President had an incentive to keep Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky from
jeopardizing the secrecy of the relationship.  That incentive
grew once the Supreme Court unanimously decided in May 1997 that
the case and discovery process were to go forward. 

<p>	At various times during the <u>Jones</u> discovery process, the
President and those working on his behalf devoted substantial
time and attention to help Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky obtain a job in the
private sector. 

<p><a name="L89"><strong>A.  Evidence </strong> 

<p>	The entire saga of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's job search and the
President's assistance in that search is discussed in detail in
the Narrative section of this Referral.  We summarize and analyze
the key events and dates here.  

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky first mentioned her desire to move to New York
in a letter to the President on July 3, 1997.  The letter
recounted her frustration that she had not received an offer to
return to work at the White House.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_324_"><sup>(324)</sup></a>  

<p>	On October 1, the President was served with interrogatories
asking about his sexual relationships with women other than Mrs.
Clinton.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_325_"><sup>(325)</sup></a>  On October 7, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky couriered a letter
expressing dissatisfaction with her job search to the
President.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_326_"><sup>(326)</sup></a>  In response, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said she received a late-night call from President Clinton on October 9, 1997.  She said
that the President told her he would start helping her find a job
in New York.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_327_"><sup>(327)</sup></a> 

<p>	The following Saturday, October 11, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met
with President Clinton alone in the Oval Office dining room from
9:36 a.m. until about 10:54 a.m.  In that meeting, she furnished
the President a list of New York jobs in which she was
interested.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_328_"><sup>(328)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky mentioned to the President that she
would need a reference from someone in the White House; the
President said he would take care of it.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_329_"><sup>(329)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also
suggested to the President that Vernon Jordan might be able to
help her, and President Clinton agreed.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_330_"><sup>(330)</sup></a>  Immediately after the
meeting, President Clinton spoke with Mr.&nbsp;Jordan by telephone.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_331_"><sup>(331)</sup></a>  

<p>	According to White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, at
some time in the summer or fall of 1997, President Clinton raised
the subject of Monica Lewinsky and stated that "she was unhappy
where she was working and wanted to come back and work at the
OEOB [Old Executive Office Building]; and could we take a
look."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_332_"><sup>(332)</sup></a>  Mr.&nbsp;Bowles referred the matter to Deputy Chief of Staff
John Podesta.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_333_"><sup>(333)</sup></a>

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Podesta said he asked Betty Currie to have Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
call him, but heard nothing until about October 1997, when
Ms.&nbsp;Currie told him that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was looking for
opportunities in New York.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_334_"><sup>(334)</sup></a>  The Ambassador to the United
Nations, Bill Richardson, said that Mr.&nbsp;Podesta told him that
Ms.&nbsp;Currie had a friend looking for a position in New York.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_335_"><sup>(335)</sup></a>

<p>	According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, Ambassador Richardson called her
on October 21, 1997,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_336_"><sup>(336)</sup></a> and interviewed her soon thereafter.  She
was then offered a position at the UN.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_337_"><sup>(337)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was
unenthusiastic.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_338_"><sup>(338)</sup></a>  During the latter part of October 1997, the
President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky discussed enlisting Vernon Jordan to
aid in pursuing private-sector possibilities.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_339_"><sup>(339)</sup></a>

<p>	On November 5, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met Mr.&nbsp;Jordan in his law
office.  Mr.&nbsp;Jordan told Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that she came "highly
recommended."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_340_"><sup>(340)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky explained that she hoped to move to
New York, and went over her list of possible employers.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_341_"><sup>(341)</sup></a> 
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan telephoned President Clinton shortly after the
meeting.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_342_"><sup>(342)</sup></a>  

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had no contact with the President or Mr.&nbsp;Jordan
for another month.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_343_"><sup>(343)</sup></a>  On December 5, 1997, however, the parties
in the <u>Jones</u> case exchanged witness lists.  Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys
listed Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky as a potential witness.  The President
testified that he learned that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was on the list late
in the day on December 6.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_344_"><sup>(344)</sup></a>  

<p>	The effort to obtain a job for Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky then
intensified.  On December 7, President Clinton met with
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan at the White House.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_345_"><sup>(345)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met with
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan on December 11 to discuss specific job contacts in New
York.  Mr.&nbsp;Jordan gave her the names of some of his business
contacts.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_346_"><sup>(346)</sup></a>  He then made calls to contacts at MacAndrews &amp;
Forbes (the parent corporation of Revlon), American Express, and
Young &amp; Rubicam.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_347_"><sup>(347)</sup></a>

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Jordan also telephoned President Clinton to keep him
informed of the efforts to help Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  Mr.&nbsp;Jordan
testified that President Clinton was aware that people were
trying to get jobs for her, that Mr. Podesta was trying to help
her, that Bill Richardson was trying to help her, but that she
wanted to work in the private sector.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_348_"><sup>(348)</sup></a>

<p>	On the same day of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's meeting with Mr.&nbsp;Jordan,
December 11, Judge Wright ordered President Clinton, over his
objection, to answer certain written interrogatories as part of
the discovery process in <u>Jones</u>.  Those interrogatories required,
among other things, the President to identify any government
employees since 1986 with whom he had engaged in sexual relations
(a term undefined for purposes of the interrogatory).<a href="7grounds.htm#N_349_"><sup>(349)</sup></a>  On
December 16, the President's attorneys received a request for
production of documents that mentioned Monica Lewinsky by name. 

<p>	On December 17, 1997, according to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, President
Clinton called her in the early morning and told her that she was
on the witness list, and they discussed their cover stories.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_350_"><sup>(350)</sup></a> 
On December 18 and December 23, she interviewed for jobs with New
York-based companies that had been contacted by Mr.&nbsp;Jordan.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_351_"><sup>(351)</sup></a>  On
December 19, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was served with a deposition subpoena
by Ms.&nbsp;Jones's lawyers.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_352_"><sup>(352)</sup></a>  On December 22, 1997, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan took
her to her new attorney; she and Mr.&nbsp;Jordan discussed the
subpoena, the <u>Jones</u> case, and her job search during the course of
the ride.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_353_"><sup>(353)</sup></a>  

<p>	The President answered the "other women" interrogatory on
December 23, 1997, by declaring under oath:  "None."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_354_"><sup>(354)</sup></a> 

<p>	On Sunday, December 28, 1997, Monica Lewinsky and the
President met in the Oval Office.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_355_"><sup>(355)</sup></a>  During that meeting, the
President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky discussed both her move to New York
and her involvement in the <u>Jones</u> suit.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_356_"><sup>(356)</sup></a>

<p>	On January 5, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky declined the United Nations
offer.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_357_"><sup>(357)</sup></a>  On January 7, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky signed the affidavit
denying the relationship with President Clinton (she had talked
on the phone to the President on January 5 about it).<a href="7grounds.htm#N_358_"><sup>(358)</sup></a>  Mr.
Jordan informed the President of her action.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_359_"><sup>(359)</sup></a>  

<p>	The next day, on January 8, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky interviewed
in New York with MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, a company recommended by
Vernon Jordan.  The interview went poorly.  Mr.&nbsp;Jordan then
called Ronald Perelman, the Chairman of the Board at MacAndrews &amp;
Forbes.  Mr.&nbsp;Perelman said Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky should not worry, and
that someone would call her back for another interview. 
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan relayed this message to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, and someone
called back that day.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_360_"><sup>(360)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky interviewed again the next morning, and a few
hours later received an informal offer for a position.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_361_"><sup>(361)</sup></a>  She
told Mr.&nbsp;Jordan of the offer, and Mr.&nbsp;Jordan then notified
President Clinton with the news:  "<u>Mission accomplished</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_362_"><sup>(362)</sup></a>

<p>	On January 12, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys informed Judge
Wright that they might call Monica Lewinsky as a trial witness.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_363_"><sup>(363)</sup></a> 
Judge Wright stated that she would allow witnesses with whom the
President had worked, such as Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, to be trial
witnesses.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_364_"><sup>(364)</sup></a>

<p>	In a call on January 13, 1998, a Revlon employee formalized
the job offer, and asked Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to provide references.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_365_"><sup>(365)</sup></a> 
Either that day or the next, President Clinton told Erskine
Bowles that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "had found a job in the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. private
sector, and she had listed John Hilley as a reference, and could
we see if he could recommend her, if asked."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_366_"><sup>(366)</sup></a>  Thereafter,
Mr.&nbsp;Bowles took the President's request to Deputy Chief of Staff
John Podesta, who in turn spoke to Mr.&nbsp;Hilley about writing a
letter of recommendation.  After speaking with Mr.&nbsp;Podesta,
Mr.&nbsp;Hilley agreed to write such a letter, but cautioned it would
be a "generic" one.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_367_"><sup>(367)</sup></a>  On January 14, at approximately 11:17
a.m., Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky faxed her letter of acceptance to Revlon and
listed Mr.&nbsp;Hilley as a reference.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_368_"><sup>(368)</sup></a>

<p>	On January 15, the President responded to the December 15
request for production of documents relating to Monica Lewinsky
by answering "none."  On January 16, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's attorney sent
to the District Court in the <u>Jones</u> case her affidavit denying a
"sexual relationship" with the President.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_369_"><sup>(369)</sup></a>  The next day, on
January 17, the President was deposed and his attorney used her
affidavit as the President similarly denied a "sexual
relationship."  

<p><a name="L90"><strong>B.  Summary</strong>

<p><em><a name="L91"><strong>	</em></strong>When a party in a lawsuit (or investigation) provides job or
financial assistance to a witness, a question arises as to
possible witness tampering.  The critical question centers on the
intent of the party providing the assistance.  Direct evidence of
that intent often is unavailable.  Indeed, in some cases, the
witness receiving the job assistance may not even know that the
party providing the assistance was motivated by a desire to stay
on good terms with the witness during the pending legal
proceeding.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_370_"><sup>(370)</sup></a>  Similarly, others who are enlisted in the party's
effort to influence the witness's testimony by providing job
assistance may not be aware of the party's motivation and intent. 

<p>	One can draw inferences about the party's intent from
circumstantial evidence.  In this case, the President assisted
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in her job search in late 1997, at a time when she
would have become a witness harmful to him in the <u>Jones</u> case <u>were
she to testify truthfully</u>.  The President did not act half-heartedly.  His assistance led to the involvement of the
Ambassador to the United Nations, one of the country's leading
business figures (Mr.&nbsp;Perelman), and one of the country's leading
attorneys (Vernon Jordan).  

<p>	The question, therefore, is whether the President's efforts
in obtaining a job for Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were to influence her
testimony<a href="7grounds.htm#N_371_"><sup>(371)</sup></a> or simply to help an ex-intimate without concern for
her testimony.  Three key facts are essential in analyzing his
actions: (i) the chronology of events, (ii) the fact that the
President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky <u>both</u> intended to lie under oath about
the relationship, and (iii) the fact that it was critical for the
President that Ms. Lewinsky lie under oath.  

<p>	There is substantial and credible information that the
President assisted Ms. Lewinsky in her job search motivated at
least in part by his desire to keep her "on the team" in the
<u>Jones</u> litigation.

<p>	President Clinton was asked during his civil deposition
whether he had talked to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's

Mr.&nbsp;Jordan had talked to Ms. Lewinsky about her move to New York,
but stated that he did not recall whether Mr. Jordan had talked
to Ms. Lewinsky about her involvement in the <u>Jones</u> case.  The
testimony was false.  A lie under oath about these conversations
was necessary to avoid inquiry into whether Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's job

<p>	The President was questioned in his civil deposition about
his conversations with Vernon Jordan regarding Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and
her role in the <u>Jones</u>&nbsp;case.  Beforehand, the President was asked
a general question:

that Monica Lewinsky had been served with a

<p>	WJC:	<u>I don't think so</u>.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_372_"><sup>(372)</sup></a>

<p>	

<p>The President later testified in more detail about conversations
he may have had with Mr.&nbsp;Jordan concerning Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's role in
the case:

<p>	Q:	Excluding conversations that you may have had with
Mr.&nbsp;Bennett or any of your attorneys in this case,
within the past two weeks has anyone reported to
you that they had had a conversation with Monica
Lewinsky concerning this lawsuit?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p><a name="L95"><strong>B.	Evidence That Contradicts the President's Civil Deposition

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Vernon Jordan testified that his conversations with the

absolutely."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_375_"><sup>(375)</sup></a>

<p>	On December 19, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky phoned Mr.&nbsp;Jordan and told him
that she had been subpoenaed in the <u>Jones</u> case.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_376_"><sup>(376)</sup></a>  Following that
call, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan telephoned the President to inform him "that

needs a lawyer, and I will try to get her a lawyer."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_380_"><sup>(380)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Later on December 19, after meeting with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky,
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan went to the White House and met with the President
alone in the Residence.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_381_"><sup>(381)</sup></a>  Mr.&nbsp;Jordan testified: "I told him that
Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed, came to me with a

<p>	According to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan, on January 7, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky

was consistent with the truth.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_387_"><sup>(387)</sup></a>

<p>	

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Jordan testified that "I knew that the President was
concerned about the affidavit and whether or not it was signed. 
<u>He was, obviously</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_388_"><sup>(388)</sup></a>  When asked why he believed the President
was concerned, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan testified:

<p>	Here is a friend of his who is being called as a
witness in another case and with whom I had gotten a
lawyer, I told him about that, and told him I was
looking for a job for her.  He knew about all of that. 
<u>And it was just a matter of course that he would be
concerned as to whether or not she had signed an
affidavit foreswearing what I told you the other day,
that there was no sexual relationship</u>.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_389_"><sup>(389)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Jordan summarized his contacts with the President about
Monica Lewinsky and her involvement in the <u>Jones</u> litigation as
follows:

<p>	I made arrangements for a lawyer and I told the
President that.  When she signed the affidavit, I told
the President that the affidavit had been signed and
when Frank Carter told me that he had filed a motion to
quash, as I did in the course of everything else, I
said to the President that I saw Frank Carter and he
had informed me that he was filing a motion to quash. 
It was as a simple information flow, absent a
substantive discussion about her defense, about which I
was not involved.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_390_"><sup>(390)</sup></a>

<p>	The President himself testified in the grand jury that he
talked to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's involvement in the
case.  Despite his earlier statements at the deposition, the
President testified to the grand jury that he had no reason to
doubt that he had talked to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's
subpoena, her lawyer, and her affidavit.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_391_"><sup>(391)</sup></a>

<p><a name="L96"><strong>C.	Summary</strong>

<p>	In his civil deposition, the President stated that he had
talked to Vernon Jordan about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's job.  But as the
testimony of Mr.&nbsp;Jordan reveals, and as the President as much as
conceded in his subsequent grand jury appearance,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_392_"><sup>(392)</sup></a> the President
<u>did</u> talk to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's involvement in the
<u>Jones</u> case -- including that she had been subpoenaed, that
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan had helped her obtain a lawyer, and that she had
signed an affidavit denying a sexual relationship with the
President.  Given their several communications in the weeks
before the deposition, it is not credible that the President
forgot the subject of their conversations during his civil
deposition.  His statements "seems like that's what Betty said"
and "I didn't know that" were more than mere omissions; they were
affirmative misstatements.   

<p>	The President's motive for making false and misleading
statements about this subject in his civil deposition was
straightforward.  If the President admitted that he had talked
with Vernon Jordan both about Monica Lewinsky's involvement in
the <u>Jones</u> case <u>and</u> about her job, questions would inevitably
arise about whether Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony and her future job
were connected.  Such an admission by the President in his civil
deposition likely would have prompted Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys to
inquire further into the subject.  And such an admission in his
deposition would have triggered public scrutiny when the
deposition became public.  

<p>	At the time of his deposition, moreover, the President was
aware of the potential problems in admitting any possible link
between those two subjects.  A criminal investigation and
substantial public attention had focused in 1997 on job
assistance and payments made to Webster Hubbell in 1994.  The
jobs and money paid to Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell by friends and contributors to
the President had raised serious questions about whether such
assistance was designed to influence Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell's testimony
about Madison-related matters.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_393_"><sup>(393)</sup></a>  Some of Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell's jobs,
moreover, had been arranged by Vernon Jordan, which was likely a
further deterrent to the President raising both Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's
job and her affidavit in connection with Vernon Jordan.<em></em>

on Saturday, January 17, 1998.  In that deposition, the President
testified that he could not recall being alone with Monica
Lewinsky and that he had not had sexual relations, a sexual
affair, or a sexual relationship with her.  During his testimony,
the President referred several times to Betty Currie and to her
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  He stated, for example, that the

White House to see Ms.&nbsp;Currie;<a href="7grounds.htm#N_395_"><sup>(395)</sup></a> that Ms.&nbsp;Currie was present when

meet with President Clinton at the White House.  She told the
grand jury:

<p>	He said that he had had his deposition yesterday, and
they had asked several questions about Monica Lewinsky. 
And I was a little shocked by that or -- (shrugging). 
And he said -- I don't know if he said -- I think he
may have said, "There are several things you may want
to know," or "There are things -- "  He asked me some
questions.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_405_"><sup>(405)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>According to Ms.&nbsp;Currie, the President then said to her in
succession:<a href="7grounds.htm#N_406_"><sup>(406)</sup></a>  

<p>		"You were always there when she was there, right? 
We were never really alone."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_407_"><sup>(407)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		"You could see and hear everything."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_408_"><sup>(408)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		"Monica came on to me, and I never touched her,
right?"<a href="7grounds.htm#N_409_"><sup>(409)</sup></a>

<p>	

<p>		"She wanted to have sex with me, and I can't do
that."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_410_"><sup>(410)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Currie indicated that these remarks were "more like
statements than questions."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_411_"><sup>(411)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Currie concluded that the
President wanted her to agree with him.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_412_"><sup>(412)</sup></a>  She based that
conclusion on the way he made most of the statements and on his
demeanor.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_413_"><sup>(413)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Currie also said that she felt the President
made these remarks to see her reaction.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_414_"><sup>(414)</sup></a>

<p>	Ms.&nbsp;Currie said that she indicated her agreement with each
of the President's statements,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_415_"><sup>(415)</sup></a> although she knew that the
President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had in fact been alone in the Oval
Office and in the President's study.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_416_"><sup>(416)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Currie also knew that
she could not or did not in fact hear or see the President and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky while they were alone.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_417_"><sup>(417)</sup></a>	

<p>	In the context of this conversation, President Clinton
appeared to be "concerned," according to Ms. Currie.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_418_"><sup>(418)</sup></a>  

<p>	The President's concern over the questions asked at the
civil deposition about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also manifested itself in
substantial efforts to contact Monica Lewinsky over the next two
days.  Shortly after her meeting with the President, Ms.&nbsp;Currie
made several attempts to contact Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  Ms.&nbsp;Currie
testified it was "possible" she did so at the President's
suggestion, and said "he may have asked me to call [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky]
to see what she knew or where she was or what was happening."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_419_"><sup>(419)</sup></a> 
Later that same night, at 11:01 p.m., the President again called
Ms.&nbsp;Currie at home.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_420_"><sup>(420)</sup></a>  Ms.&nbsp;Currie could not recall the substance
but suggested that the President had called to ask whether she
had spoken to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_421_"><sup>(421)</sup></a>  The next day, January 19, 1998,
which was a holiday, Ms.&nbsp;Currie made seven unsuccessful attempts
to contact Monica Lewinsky, by pager, between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00
a.m.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_422_"><sup>(422)</sup></a>  The President called Ms.&nbsp;Currie at home twice, and

<p>	On either Tuesday, January 20 or Wednesday, January 21 of
that week, the President again met with Ms.&nbsp;Currie and discussed
the Monica Lewinsky matter.  Ms.&nbsp;Currie testified as follows:

<p>	BC:	It was Tuesday or Wednesday.  I don't remember
which one this was, either.  But the best I
remember, when he called me in the Oval Office, <u>it
was sort of a recap[it]ulation of what we had
talked about on Sunday -- you know, "I was never
alone with her" -- that sort of thing.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

specifically to list these things?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	BC:	I don't know if that's specifically what he called
me in for, but once I got inside, that's what he
--

<p><a name="L102"><strong>B.  The President's Grand Jury Testimony</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The President was asked why he might have said to Ms.&nbsp;Currie
in their meeting on Sunday, January 18, 1998, "we were never
alone together, right?" and "you could see and hear everything." 
The President testified:

<p>	[W]hat I was trying to determine was <u>whether my
recollection was right</u> and that she was always in the
office complex when Monica was there, and whether she
thought she could hear any conversations we had, or did
she hear any.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		* * * *

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	I was trying to -- I knew .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to a reasonable
certainty that I was going to be asked more questions
about this.  I didn't really expect you to be in the
Jones case at the time.  I thought what would happen is
that it would break in the press, and <u>I was trying to
get the facts down.  I was trying to understand what
the facts were.</u><a href="7grounds.htm#N_425_"><sup>(425)</sup></a>

<p>	

<p>	Later, the President stated that he was referring to a
larger area than simply the room where he and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were
located.  He also testified that his statements to Ms.&nbsp;Currie
were intended to cover a limited range of dates:

<p>	WJC:	.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [W]hen I said, we were never alone, right,
I think I also asked her a number of other
questions, because there were several times, as
I'm sure she would acknowledge, when I either
asked her to be around.  I remember once in
particular when I was talking with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky
when I asked Betty to be in the, actually, in the
next room in the dining room, and, as I testified
earlier, once in her own office.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		But I meant that she was always in the Oval
Office complex, in that complex, while Monica
was there.  <u>And I believe that this was part
of a series of questions I asked her to try
to quickly refresh my memory.  So, I wasn't
trying to get her to say something that
wasn't so.</u>  And, in fact, I think she would
recall that I told her to just relax, go in
the grand jury and tell the truth when she
had been called as a witness.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	So, when you said to Mrs. Currie that, I was never
alone with her, right, you just meant that you and
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would be somewhere perhaps in the
Oval Office or many times in your back study, is
that correct?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	That's right.  We were in the back study.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	And then -- 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	Keep in mind, sir, I just want to make it -- I was
talking about 1997.  I was never, ever trying to
get Betty Currie to claim that on the occasions
when Monica Lewinsky was there when she wasn't
anywhere around, that she was.  I would never have
done that to her, and I don't think she thought
about that.  I don't think she thought I was
referring to that.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	Did you put a date restriction?  Did you make it
clear to Mrs. Currie that you were only asking her
whether you were never alone with her after 1997?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	Well, I don't recall whether I did or not, but I
assumed -- if I didn't, <u>I assumed she knew what I
was talking about</u>, because it was the point at
which Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was out of the White House and
had to have someone WAVE her in, in order to get
in the White House.  And I do not believe to this
day that I was -- in 1997, that she was ever there
and that I ever saw her unless Betty Currie was
there.  I don't believe she was.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_426_"><sup>(426)</sup></a>

<p>With respect to the word "alone," the President also stated that
"it depends on how you define alone" and "there were a lot of
times when we were alone, but I never really thought we were."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_427_"><sup>(427)</sup></a>

<p>	The President was also asked about his specific statement to
Betty Currie that "you could see and hear everything."  He
testified that he was uncertain what he intended by that comment:

<p>	Q:	When you said to Mrs. Currie, you could see and
hear everything, that wasn't true either, was it,
as far as you knew.  You've already -- .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My memory of that was that, that she had the
ability to hear what was going on if she came in
the Oval Office from her office.  And a lot of
times, you know, when I was in the Oval Office,
she just had the door open to her office.  Then
there was -- the door was never completely closed
to the hall.  <u>So I think there was -- I'm not
entirely sure what I meant by that, but I could
have meant that she generally would be able to
hear conversations, even if she couldn't see them</u>. 
And I think that's what I meant.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_428_"><sup>(428)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The President then testified that when he made the comment
to Ms.&nbsp;Currie about her being able to hear everything, he again
was referring to only a limited period of time:

<p>	Q:	.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.you would not have engaged in those
physically intimate acts if you knew that Mrs.
Currie could see or hear that, is that correct?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	That's correct.  But keep in mind, sir, I was
talking about 1997.  That occurred, to the -- and
I believe that occurred only once in February of
1997.  I stopped it.  I never should have started
it, and I certainly shouldn't have started it back
after I resolved not to in 1996.  And I was
referring to 1997.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		And I -- what -- as I say, I do not know --
her memory and mine may be somewhat
different.  I do not know whether I was
asking her about a particular time when
Monica was upset and I asked her to stand,
stay back in the dining area.  Or whether I
was, had reference to the fact that if she
kept the door open to the Oval Office,
because it was always -- the door to the
hallway was always somewhat open, that she
would always be able to hear something if
anything went on that was, you know, too
loud, or whatever.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		<u>I do not know what I meant</u>.  I'm just trying to
reconcile the two statements as best I can, without
being sure.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_429_"><sup>(429)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The President was also asked about his comment to Ms.&nbsp;Currie
that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had "come on" to him, but that he had "never
touched her":

<p>	Q:	.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [I]f [Ms.&nbsp;Currie] testified that you told
her, Monica came on to me and I never touched her,
you did, in fact, of course, touch Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky,
isn't that right, in a physically intimate way?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	Now, I've testified about that.  And that's one of
those questions that I believe is answered by the
statement that I made.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_430_"><sup>(430)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	What was your purpose in making these statements
to Mrs. Currie, if it weren't for the purpose to
try to suggest to her what she should say if ever
asked?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	Now, Mr.&nbsp;Bittman, I told you, the only thing I
remember is when all this stuff blew up, <u>I was
trying to figure out what the facts were.  I was
trying to remember.  I was trying to remember
every time I had seen Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew this was all going to come
out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  I did not know [at the time] that
the Office of Independent Counsel was
involved.  <u>And I was trying to get the facts
and try to think of the best defense we could
construct in the face of what I thought was
going to be a media onslaught</u>.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_431_"><sup>(431)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Finally, the President was asked why he would have called
Ms.&nbsp;Currie into his office a few days after the Sunday meeting
and repeated the statements about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to her.  The
President testified that although he would not dispute
Ms.&nbsp;Currie's testimony to the contrary, he did not remember
having a second conversation with her along these lines.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_432_"><sup>(432)</sup></a>

<p><a name="L103"><strong>C.  Summary</strong>

<p>	The President referred to Ms.&nbsp;Currie on multiple occasions
in his civil deposition when describing his relationship with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  As he himself recognized, a large number of
questions about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were likely to be asked in the very
near future.  The President thus could foresee that Ms.&nbsp;Currie
either might be deposed or questioned or might need to prepare an
affidavit.

<p>	The President called her shortly after the deposition and
met with Ms.&nbsp;Currie the next day.  The President appeared
"concerned," according to Ms.&nbsp;Currie.  He then informed
Ms.&nbsp;Currie that questions about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had been asked at
the deposition.  

<p>	The statements the President made to her on January 18 and
again on January 20 or 21 -- that he was never alone with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, that Ms.&nbsp;Currie could always hear or see them, and
that he never touched Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky -- were false, but consistent
with the testimony that the President provided under oath at his
deposition.  The President knew that the statements were false at
the time he made them to Ms.&nbsp;Currie.  The President's suggestion
that he was simply trying to refresh his memory when talking to
Ms.&nbsp;Currie conflicts with common sense:  Ms.&nbsp;Currie's
confirmation of <u>false</u> statements could not in any way remind the
President of the facts.  Thus, it is not plausible that he was
trying to refresh his recollection. 

<p>	The President's grand jury testimony reinforces that
conclusion.  He testified that in asking questions of Ms. Currie
such as "We were never alone, right" and "Monica came on to me,
and I never touched her, right," he intended a date restriction
on the questions.  But he did not articulate a date restriction
in his conversations with Ms. Currie.  Moreover, with respect to
some aspects of this incident, the President was unable to devise
any innocent explanation, testifying that he did not know why he
had asked Ms. Currie some questions and admitting that he was
"just trying to reconcile the two statements as best [he could]." 
On the other hand, if the most reasonable inference from the
President's conduct is drawn -- that he was attempting to enlist
a witness to back up his false testimony from the day before --
his behavior with Ms. Currie makes complete sense.

<p>	The content of the President's statements and the context in
which those statements were made provide substantial and credible
information that President Clinton sought improperly to influence
Ms.&nbsp;Currie's testimony.  Such actions constitute an obstruction
of justice and improper influence on a witness.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a name="L104"><strong>X.	There is substantial and credible information that President

Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice during the federal
grand jury investigation.  While refusing to testify for
seven months, he simultaneously lied to potential grand jury
witnesses knowing that they would relay the falsehoods to
the grand jury. </strong>

<p>	

<p>	The President's grand jury testimony followed seven months 
of investigation in which he had refused six invitations to
testify before the grand jury.  During this period, there was no
indication that the President would admit any sexual relationship
with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  To the contrary, the President vehemently
denied the allegations.

<p>	Rather than lie to the grand jury himself, the President
lied about his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to senior aides,
and those aides then conveyed the President's false story to the
grand jury.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_433_"><sup>(433)</sup></a>  

<p>	In this case, the President lied to, among others, three
current senior aides -- John Podesta, Erskine Bowles, and Sidney
Blumenthal -- and one former senior aide, Harold Ickes.  The
President denied any kind of sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky; said that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had made a sexual demand on him;
and denied multiple telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky. 
The President, by his own later admission, was aware that his
aides were likely to convey the President's version of events to
the grand jury. 

<p>	The President's aides took the President at his word when he
made these statements.  Each aide then testified to the nature of
the relationship between Monica Lewinsky and the President based
on those statements -- without knowing that they were calculated
falsehoods by the President designed to perpetuate the false
statements that the President made during his deposition in the
<u>Jones</u> case. 

<p>	The aides' testimony provided the grand jury a false account
of the relationship between the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 
Their testimony thus had the potential to affect the
investigation -- including decisions by the OIC and grand jury
about how to conduct the investigation (for example, whether to
subpoena Secret Service agents) and whether to indict particular
individuals.

<p>	John Podesta, Deputy Chief of Staff,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_434_"><sup>(434)</sup></a> testified that on
several occasions shortly after the media first began reporting
the Lewinsky allegations, the President either denied having a
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky or otherwise minimized his
involvement with her.  

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Podesta described a meeting with the President, Chief of
Staff Erskine Bowles, and Deputy Chief of Staff Sylvia Matthews,
in the morning of January 21, 1998.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_435_"><sup>(435)</sup></a>  During that meeting, the
President stated:  "Erskine, I want you to know that this story

said "that he had not had a sexual relationship with her, and
that he never asked anybody to lie."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_437_"><sup>(437)</sup></a>

<p>	Several days later, on January 23, 1998, the President more
adamantly told Mr.&nbsp;Podesta that he had not engaged in sex of any
"kind, shape or manner" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  Mr.&nbsp;Podesta recalled:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	JP:	[H]e said to me that he had never had sex with
her, and that -- and that he never asked -- you

when she had come by, she came by to see Betty, and that he --
when she was there, either Betty was with them -- either that she

the false "cover stories" that the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had
agreed to use.

<p>	Both the President and Mr.&nbsp;Podesta knew that Mr.&nbsp;Podesta was
likely to be a witness in the ongoing grand jury criminal
investigation.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_441_"><sup>(441)</sup></a>  Nonetheless, Mr.&nbsp;Podesta recalled that the

Mr.&nbsp;Podesta repeated to the grand jury the false and misleading

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Bowles, the White House Chief of Staff,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_446_"><sup>(446)</sup></a> confirmed
Mr.&nbsp;Podesta's account of the President's January 21, 1998,
statement in which the President denied having a sexual
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  Mr.&nbsp;Bowles testified:

<p>	EB:	And this was the day this huge story breaks.  And
the three of us walked in together -- Sylvia

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

looked up at us and he said the same thing he said

you'll understand."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_447_"><sup>(447)</sup></a>   

<p>	

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Bowles testified that he took the President's statements
seriously:  "All I can tell you is:  This guy who I've worked for
looked me in the eye and said he did not have sexual
relationships with her.  And if I didn't believe him, I couldn't
stay.  So I believe him."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_448_"><sup>(448)</sup></a>  Mr.&nbsp;Bowles repeated the President's
false and misleading statement to the grand jury.

<p>	<a name="L108"><strong>3.  Sidney Blumenthal</strong>  

<p>	Sidney Blumenthal, an Assistant to the President,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_449_"><sup>(449)</sup></a>
similarly testified that the President made statements to him
denying the Lewinsky allegations shortly after the first media
report.  

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal stated that he spoke to Mrs. Clinton on the
afternoon of January 21, 1998, and to the President early that
evening.  During those conversations, both the President and Mrs.
Clinton offered an explanation for the President's meetings with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, and President Clinton offered an explanation for
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's allegations of a sexual relationship.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_450_"><sup>(450)</sup></a>  

<p>	Testifying before the grand jury, Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal related his
discussion with President Clinton:  

<p>	I said to the President, "What have you done wrong?" 
And he said, "Nothing.  I haven't done anything wrong."

<p>	.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it was at that point that he gave his account
of what had happened to me and he said that Monica --
and it came very fast.  He said, "<u>Monica Lewinsky came
at me and made a sexual demand on me."  He rebuffed
her.  He said, "I've gone down that road before, I've
caused pain for a lot of people and I'm not going to do
that again</u>."

<p>		

<p>		<u>She threatened him.  She said that she would tell

she had an affair or said she had an affair then she
wouldn't be the stalker any more</u>.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_452_"><sup>(452)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal testified that the President appeared "upset"
during this conversation.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_453_"><sup>(453)</sup></a>  

<p>	Finally, Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal asked the President to explain
alleged answering machine messages (a detail mentioned in press
reports). 

<p>		He said that he remembered calling her when Betty
Currie's brother died and that he left a message on her
voice machine that Betty's brother had died and he said
she was close to Betty and had been very kind to Betty. 
And that's what he recalled.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_454_"><sup>(454)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>According to Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal, the President said that the call he
made to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky relating to Betty's brother was the "only
one he could remember."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_455_"><sup>(455)</sup></a>  That was false:  The President and Ms.
Lewinsky talked often on the phone, and the subject matter of the
calls was memorable.

<p>	A grand juror asked Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal whether the President had
said that his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky included any kind of
sexual activity.  Mr. Blumenthal testified that the President's
response was "the opposite.  <u>He told me that she came on to him
and that he had told her he couldn't have sexual relations with
her and that she threatened him.  That is what he told me</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_456_"><sup>(456)</sup></a>  

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal testified that after the President relayed
this information to him, he "certainly believed his story.  It
was a very heartfelt story, he was pouring out his heart, and I
believed him."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_457_"><sup>(457)</sup></a> Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal repeated to the grand jury the
false statements that the President made to him.

<p>	<a name="L109"><strong>4.  Harold Ickes</strong>  

<p>	Mr.&nbsp;Ickes, a former Deputy Chief of Staff,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_458_"><sup>(458)</sup></a> also related to
the grand jury a conversation that he had with the President on
the morning of January 26, 1998,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_460_"><sup>(460)</sup></a> during which the President
denied the Lewinsky allegations.   

<p>	Regarding that conversation, Mr.&nbsp;Ickes testified:  "The two
things that I recall, the two things that he again repeated in
public -- had already said publicly and repeated in public that
same Monday morning was that <u>he had not had -- he did not have a

that he had done nothing -- now I'm paraphrasing -- had done
nothing to ask anybody to change their story or suborn perjury or
obstruct justice."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_461_"><sup>(461)</sup></a>

statements to the grand jury.

<p><a name="L110"><strong>B.  The President's Grand Jury Testimony</strong>

<p>	The President admitted to the grand jury that, after the
allegations were publicly reported, he made "misleading"
statements to particular aides whom he knew would likely be

<p>called to testify before the grand jury.  The President testified
as follows:

<p>	Q:	Do you recall denying any sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky to the following people:  Harry
Thomasson, Erskine Bowles, Harold Ickes,
Mr.&nbsp;Podesta, Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan, Ms.&nbsp;Betty
Currie?  Do you recall denying any sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky to those
individuals?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>I recall telling a number of those people that I
didn't have, either I didn't have an affair with
Monica Lewinsky or didn't have sex with her.</u>  And
I believe, sir, that -- you'll have to ask them
what they thought.  But I was using those terms in
the normal way people use them.  <u>You'll have to
ask them what they thought I was saying</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	If they testified that you denied sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, or if they told
us that you denied that, do you have any reason to
doubt them, in the days after the story broke; do
you have any reason to doubt them?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>No</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The President then was specifically asked whether he knew
that his aides were likely to be called before the grand jury.

<p>	Q:	It may have been misleading, sir, and you knew
though, after January 21st when the Post article
broke and said that Judge Starr was looking into
this, you knew that they might be witnesses.  <u>You
knew that they might be called into a grand jury,
didn't you</u>?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>That's right</u>.  I think I was quite careful what I
said after that.  I may have said something to all
these people to that effect, but I'll also --
whenever anybody asked me any details, I said,
look, I don't want you to be a witness or I turn
you into a witness or give you information that
would get you in trouble.  I just wouldn't talk. 
I, by and large, didn't talk to people about this. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	If all of these people -- let's leave out Mrs.
Currie for a minute.  Vernon Jordan, Sid
Blumenthal, John Podesta, Harold Ickes, Erskine
Bowles, Harry Thomasson, after the story broke,
after Judge Starr's involvement was known on
January 21st, have said that you denied a sexual
relationship with them.  Are you denying that?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>No</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	And you've told us that you --

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	I'm just telling you what I meant by it.  I told
you what I meant by it when they started this
deposition.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Q:	You've told us now that you were being careful,
but that it might have been misleading.  Is that
correct?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	WJC:	<u>It might have been</u>. . . .  So, what I was trying
to do was to give them something they could --
that would be true, <u>even if misleading in the
context of this deposition</u>, and keep them out of
trouble, and let's deal -- and deal with what I
thought was the almost ludicrous suggestion that I
had urged someone to lie or tried to suborn
perjury, in other words.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_463_"><sup>(463)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a name="L111"><strong>C.  Summary </strong>

<p>	The President made the following misleading statements to
his aides:

<p>		The President told Mr.&nbsp;Podesta that he had
not engaged in sex "in any way whatsoever"
with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, <u>"including oral sex"</u>.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		The President told Mr.&nbsp;Podesta,  Mr.&nbsp;Bowles, and
Mr.&nbsp;Ickes that he did not have a "sexual
relationship" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		The President told Mr.&nbsp;Podesta that "when
[Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky] came by, she came by to see
Betty [Currie]."

<p>		The President told Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "came on to him and that he had
told her he couldn't have sexual relations
with her and that she threatened him." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		The President told Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal that he
couldn't remember making any calls to
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky other than once when he left a
message on her answering machine.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	During the President's grand jury testimony, the President
admitted that his statements to aides denying a sexual
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "may have been misleading."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_464_"><sup>(464)</sup></a>  The
President also knew his aides likely would be called to testify
regarding any communications with him about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  And he
presumably expected his aides to repeat his statements regarding
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to all questioners, including to the grand jury. 
Finally, he himself refused to testify for many months.  The
combination of the President's silence and his deception of his
aides had the effect of presenting a false view of events to the
grand jury.

<p>	The President says that at the time he spoke to his aides,
he chose his words with great care so that, in his view, his
statements would be literally true because he was referring only
to intercourse.  That explanation is undermined by the
President's testimony before the grand jury that his denials "may
have been misleading" and by the contradictory testimony by the
aides themselves -- particularly John Podesta, who says that the
President specifically denied oral sex with Ms. Lewinsky. 
Moreover, on January 24, 1998, the White House issued talking
points for its staff, and those talking points refute the
President's literal truth argument:  The talking points state as
the President's view the belief that a relationship that includes
oral sex is "of course" a "sexual relationship."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_465_"><sup>(465)</sup></a>

<p>	For all of these reasons, there is substantial and credible
information that the President improperly tampered with witnesses
during the grand jury investigation. 

<p><a name="L112"><strong>XI.	There is substantial and credible information that President

Clinton's actions since January 17, 1998, regarding his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky have been inconsistent
with the President's constitutional duty to faithfully
execute the laws.</strong>

<p>	

<p>	Before, during, and after his January 17, 1998, civil
deposition, the President attempted to conceal the truth about
his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky from the judicial process in
the <u>Jones</u> case.  Furthermore, the President has since lied under
oath to the grand jury and facilitated the provision of false
information to the grand jury by others.

<p>	The President also misled the American people and the
Congress in his public statement of January 26, 1998, in which he
denied "sexual relations" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  The President
misled his Cabinet and his senior aides by denying the
relationship to them.  The Cabinet and senior aides in turn
misled the American people and the Congress by conveying the
President's denials and professing their belief in the
credibility of those denials.  

<p>	The President promised in January 1998 to cooperate fully
with the grand jury investigation and to provide "more rather
than less, sooner rather than later."  At that time, the OIC was
conducting a criminal investigation and was obligated to report
to Congress any substantial and credible information that may
constitute grounds for an impeachment. 

<p>	The President's conduct delayed the grand jury investigation
(and thereby delayed any potential congressional proceedings). 
He asserted, appealed, withdrew, and reasserted Executive
Privilege (and asserted other governmental privileges never
before applied in federal criminal proceedings <u>against</u> the
government).  The President asserted these privileges concerning
the investigation of factual questions about which the President
already knew the answers.  The President refused six invitations
to testify voluntarily before the grand jury.  At the same time,
the President's aides and surrogates argued publicly that the
entire matter was frivolous and that any investigation of it
should cease.  	

<p>	After being subpoenaed in July, the President made false
statements to the grand jury on August 17, 1998.  That night, the
President again made false statements to the American people and
Congress, contending that his answers in his civil deposition had
been "legally accurate."  The President then made an implicit
plea for Congress to take no action:  "Our country has been
distracted by this matter for too long."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_466_"><sup>(466)</sup></a>

<p>	The President has pursued a strategy of (i)&nbsp;deceiving the
American people and Congress in January 1998, (ii)&nbsp;delaying and
impeding the criminal investigation for seven months, and
(iii)&nbsp;deceiving the American people and Congress again in August
1998. 

<p><a name="L113"><strong>A.	Beginning on January 21, 1998, the President misled the

American people and Congress regarding the truth of his
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.</strong>	

<p>	On January 21, 1998, the day the <u>Washington Post</u> first
reported the Lewinsky matter, the President talked to his long-time advisor Dick Morris.  With the President's approval,
Mr.&nbsp;Morris commissioned a poll that evening.  The results
indicated that voters were willing to forgive the President for
adultery but <u>not</u> for perjury or obstruction of justice.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_467_"><sup>(467)</sup></a>  When
the President telephoned him that evening, Mr.&nbsp;Morris explained
that the President thus should not go public with a confession or
explanation.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_468_"><sup>(468)</sup></a>  According to Mr.&nbsp;Morris, the President replied,
"<u>Well, we just have to win, then</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_469_"><sup>(469)</sup></a>  

<p>	The next evening, the President dissuaded Mr.&nbsp;Morris from
any plan to "blast[] Monica Lewinsky 'out of the water.'"  The
President indicated that "there's some slight chance that she may
not be cooperating with Starr and we don't want to alienate
her."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_470_"><sup>(470)</sup></a> 

<p>	The President himself spoke publicly about the matter
several times in the initial days after the story broke.  On
January 26, the President was definitive:  "I want to say one
thing to the American people.  I want you to listen to me.  I'm
going to say this again:  I did not have sexual relations with
that woman, Miss Lewinsky.  I never told anybody to lie, not a
single time.  Never.  These allegations are false."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_471_"><sup>(471)</sup></a>

<p>	The President's emphatic denial to the American people was
false.  And his statement was not an impromptu comment in the
heat of a press conference.  To the contrary, it was an
intentional and calculated falsehood to deceive the Congress and
the American people.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_472_"><sup>(472)</sup></a>

<p><a name="L114"><strong>B.	The First Lady, the Cabinet, the President's staff, and the

President's associates relied on and publicly emphasized the
President's denial.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	After the President lied to the American people, the
President's associates argued that the allegations against the
President were false and even scurrilous.  	

<p>	Mrs. Clinton forcefully denied the allegations on January
27, 1998, one day after the President's public denial.  She
admitted that the American people "should certainly be concerned"
if a President had an affair and lied to cover it up.  She
acknowledged that it would be a "very serious offense."  But she
emphasized that the allegations were false -- a "pretty bad"
smear.  She noted that the President "has denied these
allegations on all counts, unequivocally."  And Mrs. Clinton
shifted the focus away from the President, indicated that "this
is a battle" and stated that "some folks are going to have a lot
to answer for" when the facts come out.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_473_"><sup>(473)</sup></a>

<p>	The most senior officials in the Executive Branch served as
additional (albeit unwitting) agents of the President's
deception.  The Cabinet and White House aides stated emphatically
that the allegations were false.  For example, White House
spokesperson Michael McCurry was asked whether the President's
denial covered all forms of sexual contact, and Mr. McCurry
stated that "I think every American that heard him knows exactly
what he meant."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_474_"><sup>(474)</sup></a>  So, too, White House Communications Director
Ann Lewis said on January 26, 1998:  "I can say with absolute
assurance the President of the United States did not have a
sexual relationship because I have heard the President of the
United States say so.  He has said it, he could not be more
clear.  He could not have been more direct."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_475_"><sup>(475)</sup></a>  She added:  "Sex
is sex, even in Washington.  I've been assured."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_476_"><sup>(476)</sup></a>  

<p>	After a Cabinet meeting on January 23, 1998, in which the
President offered denials, several members of the Cabinet
appeared outside the White House.  Secretary of State Albright
stated:  "I believe that the allegations are completely
untrue."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_477_"><sup>(477)</sup></a>  Coupled with the President's firm denial, the united
front of the President's closest advisors helped shape perception
of the issue. 

<p><a name="L115"><strong>C.	The President repeatedly and unlawfully invoked the

Executive Privilege to conceal evidence of his personal
misconduct from the grand jury.</strong>

<p>	

<p>	When the allegations about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky first arose, the
President informed the American people that he would cooperate
fully.  He told Jim Lehrer that "we are doing our best to
cooperate here."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_478_"><sup>(478)</sup></a>  He told National Public Radio that "I have
told people that I would cooperate in the investigation, and I
expect to cooperate with it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  I'm going to do my best to
cooperate with the investigation."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_479_"><sup>(479)</sup></a>  He told <u>Roll Call</u> "I'm
going to cooperate with this investigation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  And I'll
cooperate."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_480_"><sup>(480)</sup></a>    

<p>	Such cooperation did not occur.  The White House's approach
to the constitutionally based principle of Executive Privilege
most clearly exposed the non-cooperation.  In 1994, White House
Counsel Lloyd Cutler issued an opinion that the Clinton
Administration would not invoke Executive Privilege for cases
involving personal wrongdoing by any government official.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_481_"><sup>(481)</sup></a>  By
1998, however, the President had blended the official and
personal dimensions to the degree that the President's private
counsel stated in a legal brief filed in the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit:  "In a very real
and significant way, the objectives of William J. Clinton, the
person, and his Administration (the Clinton White House) are one
and the same."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_482_"><sup>(482)</sup></a>  	

<p>	After the Monica Lewinsky investigation began, the President
invoked Executive Privilege for the testimony of five witnesses:
Bruce Lindsey, Cheryl Mills, Nancy Hernreich, Sidney Blumenthal,
and Lanny Breuer.  These claims were patently groundless.  Even
for <u>official</u> communications within the scope of the privilege,
the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1974 in <u>United States v.
Nixon</u><a href="7grounds.htm#N_483_"><sup>(483)</sup></a>&nbsp;that the Executive Privilege gives way in the face of the
compelling need for evidence in criminal proceedings.

<p>	The President's assertion of Executive Privilege for
Ms.&nbsp;Hernreich, an assistant who manages the secretarial work for
the Oval Office,<a href="7grounds.htm#N_484_"><sup>(484)</sup></a> was frivolous.  At the time that the President
was asserting Executive Privilege for one assistant, the
President's other assistant (Betty Currie) had already testified
extensively.  

<p>	Based on <u>Nixon</u>, the OIC filed a motion to compel the
testimony of Hernreich, Lindsey, and Blumenthal.  The United
States District Court held a hearing on March 20.  Just before
the hearing, the White House -- without explanation -- dropped
its Executive Privilege claim as to Ms.&nbsp;Hernreich.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_485_"><sup>(485)</sup></a>  

<p>	On May 4, 1998, Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled
against the President on the Executive Privilege issue.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_486_"><sup>(486)</sup></a>  After
the White House filed a notice of appeal, the OIC filed an
expedited petition for certiorari before judgment in the Supreme
Court.  The President thereupon dropped his claim of Executive
Privilege.

<p>	The tactics employed by the White House have not been
confined to the judicial process.  On March 24, while the
President was traveling in Africa, he was asked about the
assertion of Executive Privilege.  He responded, "You should ask
someone who knows."  He also stated "I haven't discussed that
with the lawyers.  I don't know."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_487_"><sup>(487)</sup></a>  

<p>	This was untrue.  Unbeknownst to the public, in a
declaration filed in District Court on March 17 (seven days
before the President's public expression of ignorance), White
House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff informed Chief Judge Johnson that
he "ha[d] discussed" the matter with the President, who had
directed the assertion of Executive Privilege.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_488_"><sup>(488)</sup></a>   

<p>	The deception has continued.  Because the President withdrew
his Executive Privilege claim while the case was pending in the
Supreme Court of the United States, it was assumed that the
President would no longer assert Executive Privilege.  But that
assumption proved incorrect.  White House attorney Lanny Breuer
appeared before the grand jury on August 4, 1998, and invoked
Executive Privilege.  He would not answer, for example, whether
the President had told him about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and whether they had discussed the gifts he had given to
Monica Lewinsky.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_489_"><sup>(489)</sup></a>  On August 11, 1998, Chief Judge Johnson
denied the Executive Privilege claim as a basis for refusing to
testify, and ordered Mr.&nbsp;Breuer to testify.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_490_"><sup>(490)</sup></a> 

<p>	On August 11, 1998, Deputy White House Counsel Cheryl Mills
testified and repeatedly asserted Executive Privilege at the
President's direction.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_491_"><sup>(491)</sup></a>  The breadth of the claim was striking: 
The privilege was asserted not only for Ms.&nbsp;Mills's
communications with the President, senior staff, and staff
members of the White House Counsel's Office -- but also for
Ms.&nbsp;Mills's communications with <u>private</u> lawyers for the
President, <u>private</u> lawyers for grand jury witnesses, and Betty
Currie.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_492_"><sup>(492)</sup></a>

<p>	On August 17, the President testified before the grand jury. 
At the request of a grand juror, the OIC asked the President
about his assertions of Executive Privilege and why he had
withdrawn the claim before the Supreme Court.  The President
replied that "I didn't really want to advance an executive
privilege claim in this case beyond having it litigated, so that
we, we had not given up on principal [sic] this matter, without
having some judge rule on it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  <u>I strongly felt we should
not appeal your victory on the executive privilege issue</u>."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_493_"><sup>(493)</sup></a>

<p>	Four days after this sworn statement, on August 21, 1998,
the President filed a notice of appeal with respect to the
Executive Privilege claim for Lanny Breuer that Chief Judge
Johnson had denied ten days earlier (and six days before the
President's testimony).  In addition, Bruce Lindsey appeared
again before the grand jury on August 28, 1998, and the President
<u>again</u> asserted Executive Privilege with respect to his testimony
-- even though the President had dropped the claim of Executive
Privilege for Mr.&nbsp;Lindsey while the case was pending before the
Supreme Court of the United States in June.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_494_"><sup>(494)</sup></a> 

<p>	The Executive Privilege was not the only claim of privilege
interposed to prevent the grand jury from gathering relevant
information.  The President also acquiesced in the Secret
Service's attempt to have the Judiciary craft a new protective
function privilege (rejecting requests by this Office that the
President order the Secret Service officers to testify).  The
District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit rejected the privilege claim.  The litigation
was disruptive to the Secret Service and to the grand jury.  The
frivolity of the claim is evidenced by the Chief Justice's
decision to reject the Secret Service's request for a stay
without even referring the matter to the full Court.  All of that
litigation would have been unnecessary had the President
testified in February instead of August, or had he taken the
position that relevant facts should be fully available to the
grand jury. 

<p><a name="L116"><strong>D.	The President refused six invitations to testify to the

grand jury, thereby delaying expeditious resolution of this
matter, and then refused to answer relevant questions before
the grand jury when he testified in August 1998. </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>>This Office extended six separate invitations to the
President to testify before the grand jury.  The first invitation
was issued on January 28, 1998.  The OIC repeated the invitations
on behalf of the grand jury on February 4, February 9, February
21, March 2, and March 13.  The President declined each
invitation.  His refusals substantially delayed this Office's
investigation.

<p>	Finally, in the face of the President's actions, this Office
asked the grand jury to consider issuing a subpoena to the
President.  The grand jury deliberated and approved the issuance
of a subpoena.  On July 17, 1998, the OIC served the subpoena, in
accordance with the grand jury's action, on the President's
private counsel.  The subpoena required the President to appear
on July 28.  

<p>	The President sought to delay his testimony.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_495_"><sup>(495)</sup></a>  Shortly
after a hearing before the District Court on the President's
motion for a continuance, the President and the OIC reached an
agreement by which the President would testify on August 17 via
live video feed to the grand jury.  In a Rose Garden ceremony on
July 31, 1998, the President stated to the country:  "I'm looking
forward to the opportunity . . . of testifying.  I will do so
completely and truthfully."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_496_"><sup>(496)</sup></a>

<p>	At the outset of his grand jury appearance, the President
similarly stated:  "I will answer each question as accurately and
fully as I can."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_497_"><sup>(497)</sup></a>  The President then read a prepared statement
in which he admitted "inappropriate intimate contact" with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<a href="7grounds.htm#N_498_"><sup>(498)</sup></a>  Despite his statement that he would answer each
question, the President refused to answer specific questions
about that contact (other than to indicate that it was not
intercourse and did not involve the direct touching of
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitals).<a href="7grounds.htm#N_499_"><sup>(499)</sup></a> 

<p><a name="L117"><strong>E. 	The President misled the American people and the Congress in

his public statement on August 17, 1998, when he stated that
his answers at his civil deposition in January had been
"legally accurate."</strong> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The President addressed the Nation on the evening of August
17, 1998, after his grand jury appearance.  The President did not
tell the truth.  He stated:  "As you know, in a deposition in
January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.  While my answers were <u>legally accurate</u>, I did not
volunteer information."<a href="7grounds.htm#N_500_"><sup>(500)</sup></a>  As this Referral has demonstrated, the
President's statements in his civil deposition were <u>not</u> "legally
accurate," and he could not reasonably have thought they were.
They were deliberate falsehoods designed to conceal the truth of
the President's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 

<p>	The President's claim that his testimony during the civil
deposition was legally accurate -- which he made to the grand
jury and to the American people on August 17 -- perpetuates the
deception and concealment that has accompanied his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky since his first sexual encounter with her on
November 15, 1995.

<p><a name="L118"><strong>F.  Summary</strong>

<p>	In this case, the President made and caused to be made false
statements to the American people about his relationship with
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.  He also made false statements about whether he had
lied under oath or otherwise obstructed justice in his civil
case.  By publicly and emphatically stating in January 1998 that
"I did not have sexual relations with that woman" and these
"allegations are false," the President also effectively delayed a
possible congressional inquiry, and then he further delayed it by
asserting Executive Privilege and refusing to testify for six
months during the Independent Counsel investigation.  This
represents substantial and credible information that may
constitute grounds for an impeachment.

<p><a name="N_472_">472. </a>  Other than Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's status and age, several
aspects of the relationship could have raised public concerns.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<u>First</u>, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky lost her job at the White House in April
1996 and was transferred to the Pentagon.  Under oath,
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was asked:  "Do you believe that if you hadn't had a
sexual relationship with the President that you would have kept
your job at the White House?"  She answered:  "Yes."  Lewinsky
8/26/98 Depo. at 60.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<u>Second</u>, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was asked, "Do you believe that your
difficulty or inability to return to employment at the White
House was because of your sexual relationship with him?"  She
answered:  "Yes.  Or the issues that, or that the problems that
people perceived that really were based in truth because I had a
relationship with the President."  Lewinsky 8/26/98 Depo. at 60. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<u>Third</u>, in late 1997, the President saw to it that
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky received extraordinary job assistance.  Such
assistance might have been tied to her involvement in the <u>Jones</u>
case, as discussed earlier, as well as a benefit to an ex-paramour.  If the latter was a factor, then the President's
actions discriminated against all of those interns and employees
who did not receive the same benefit.

<p><a name="N_485_">485. </a>  Even though the White House later withdrew the claim,
the mere assertion of Executive Privilege as to Ms.&nbsp;Hernreich is
important.  Such an invocation causes a needless, but
substantial, expenditure of litigation resources and delays and
impedes the grand jury process.  The overuse of Executive
Privilege <u>against</u> the United States in the criminal process thus
ultimately hinders the faithful execution of the laws -- as the
Supreme Court unanimously recognized twenty-four years ago in
<u>United States v. Nixon</u>.

withdrawal of Executive Privilege was not new to this Office.  In
August 1996, the White House invoked Executive Privilege to
prevent White House attorneys from producing documents regarding
their communications with Hillary Rodham Clinton.  After the OIC
filed a motion to compel in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Arkansas, the claim was withdrawn, and
the White House relied solely on a claim of government attorney-client privilege, which the United States Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit rejected.  The public never knew at that time
of the President's assertion of Executive Privilege in that case.

<p>	

<p>	In 1997, the President again asserted Executive Privilege --
this time to prevent Thomas "Mack" McLarty from testifying fully. 
The conversations in question related in part to Mr.&nbsp;McLarty's
efforts to find employment for Webster Hubbell as Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell was
resigning his position as Associate Attorney General.  The
President withdrew the assertion before the OIC filed a motion to
compel.
