<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As required by Section 595(c) of Title 28 of the United
States Code, the Office of the Independent Counsel ("OIC" or
"Office") hereby submits substantial and credible information
that President William Jefferson Clinton committed acts that may
constitute grounds for an impeachment.<a href="5intro.htm#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<p>	The information reveals that President Clinton:

<p>	 	lied under oath at a civil deposition while he was a
defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 	lied under oath to a grand jury;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		attempted to influence the testimony of a potential
witness who had direct knowledge of facts that would
reveal the falsity of his deposition testimony;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		attempted to obstruct justice by facilitating a
witness's plan to refuse to comply with a subpoena;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 	attempted to obstruct justice by encouraging a witness
to file an affidavit that the President knew would be
false, and then by making use of that false affidavit
at his own deposition;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		lied to potential grand jury witnesses, knowing that
they would repeat those lies before the grand jury; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		engaged in a pattern of conduct that was inconsistent
with his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the
laws.

<p>The evidence shows that these acts, and others, were part of a
pattern that began as an effort to prevent the disclosure of
information about the President's relationship with a former
White House intern and employee, Monica S. Lewinsky, and
continued as an effort to prevent the information from being
disclosed in an ongoing criminal investigation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center><a name="L2"><strong>Factual Background</strong></center>


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In May 1994, Paula Corbin Jones filed a lawsuit against
William Jefferson Clinton in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Arkansas.<a href="5intro.htm#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  Ms. Jones alleged that while
he was the Governor of Arkansas, President Clinton sexually
harassed her during an incident in a Little Rock hotel room.<a href="5intro.htm#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
President Clinton denied the allegations.  He also challenged the
ability of a private litigant to pursue a lawsuit against a
sitting President.  In May 1997, the Supreme Court unanimously
rejected the President's legal argument.  The Court concluded
that Ms. Jones, "[l]ike every other citizen who properly invokes
[the District Court's] jurisdiction . . . has a right to an
orderly disposition of her claims," and that therefore Ms. Jones
was entitled to pursue her claims while the President was in
office.<a href="5intro.htm#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  A few months later, the pretrial discovery process
began.<a href="5intro.htm#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

<p>			One sharply disputed issue in the <u>Jones</u> litigation was the
extent to which the President would be required to disclose
information about sexual relationships he may have had with
"other women."  Ms. Jones's attorneys sought disclosure of this
information, arguing that it was relevant to proving that the
President had propositioned Ms. Jones.  The President resisted
the discovery requests, arguing that evidence of relationships
with other women (if any) was irrelevant.

<p>	In late 1997, the issue was presented to United States
District Judge Susan Webber Wright for resolution.  Judge
Wright's decision was unambiguous.  For purposes of pretrial
discovery, President Clinton was required to provide certain
information about his alleged relationships with other women.  In
an order dated December 11, 1997, for example, Judge Wright said: 
"The Court finds, therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to
information regarding any individuals with whom the President had
sexual relations or proposed or sought to have sexual relations
and who were during the relevant time frame state or federal
employees."<a href="5intro.htm#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  Judge Wright left for another day the issue whether
any information of this type would be admissible were the case to
go to trial.  But for purposes of answering the written questions
served on the President, and for purposes of answering questions
at a deposition, the District Court ruled that the President must
respond.

<p>	In mid-December 1997, the President answered one of the
written discovery questions posed by Ms. Jones on this issue. 
When asked to identify all women who were state or federal
employees and with whom he had had "sexual relations" since
1986,<a href="5intro.htm#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> the President answered under oath: "None."<a href="5intro.htm#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>  For purposes
of this interrogatory, the term "sexual relations" was not
defined.

<p>	On January 17, 1998, President Clinton was questioned under
oath about his relationships with other women in the workplace,
this time at a deposition.  Judge Wright presided over the
deposition.  The President was asked numerous questions about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, by then a 24-year-old former
White House intern, White House employee, and Pentagon employee. 
Under oath and in the presence of Judge Wright, the President
denied that he had engaged in a "sexual affair," a "sexual
relationship," or "sexual relations" with Ms. Lewinsky.  The
President also stated that he had no specific memory of having
been alone with Ms. Lewinsky, that he remembered few details of
any gifts they might have exchanged, and indicated that no one
except his attorneys had kept him informed of Ms. Lewinsky's
status as a potential witness in the <u>Jones</u> case.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center><a name="L3"><strong>The Investigation</strong></center>


<p>	On January 12, 1998, this Office received information that
Monica Lewinsky was attempting to influence the testimony of one
of the witnesses in the <u>Jones</u> litigation, and that Ms. Lewinsky
herself was prepared to provide false information under oath in
that lawsuit.  The OIC was also informed that Ms. Lewinsky had
spoken to the President and the President's close friend Vernon
Jordan about being subpoenaed to testify in the <u>Jones</u> suit, and
that Vernon Jordan and others were helping her find a job.  The
allegations with respect to Mr. Jordan and the job search were
similar to ones already under review in the ongoing Whitewater
investigation.<a href="5intro.htm#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

<p>	After gathering preliminary evidence to test the
information's reliability, the OIC presented the evidence to
Attorney General Janet Reno.  Based on her review of the
information, the Attorney General determined that a further
investigation by the Independent Counsel was required.

<p>	On the following day, Attorney General Reno petitioned the
Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit, on an expedited basis, to expand
the jurisdiction of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr.  On
January 16, 1998, in response to the Attorney General's request,
the Special Division issued an order that provides in pertinent
part:

<p>	The Independent Counsel shall have jurisdiction and
authority to investigate to the maximum extent authorized by
the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994 whether
Monica Lewinsky or others suborned perjury, obstructed
justice, intimidated witnesses, or otherwise violated
federal law other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or
infraction in dealing with witnesses, potential witnesses,
attorneys, or others concerning the civil case <u>Jones v.
Clinton</u>.<a href="5intro.htm#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On January 28, 1998, after the allegations about the
President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky became public, the OIC
filed a Motion for Limited Intervention and a Stay of Discovery
in <u>Jones v. Clinton</u>.  The OIC argued that the civil discovery
process should be halted because it was having a negative effect
on the criminal investigation.  The OIC represented to the Court
that numerous individuals then under subpoena in <u>Jones</u>, including
Monica Lewinsky, were integral to the OIC's investigation, and
that courts routinely stayed discovery in such circumstances.<a href="5intro.htm#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

<p>	The next day Judge Wright responded to the OIC's motion. 
The Court ruled that discovery would be permitted to continue,
except to the extent that it sought information about Monica
Lewinsky.  The Court acknowledged that "evidence concerning
Monica Lewinsky might be relevant to the issues in [the <u>Jones</u>]
case."<a href="5intro.htm#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>  It concluded, however, that this evidence was not
"essential to the core issues in this case," and that some of
that evidence "might even be inadmissible."<a href="5intro.htm#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  The Court found
that the potential value of this evidence was outweighed by the
potential delay to the <u>Jones</u> case in continuing to seek discovery
about Ms. Lewinsky.<a href="5intro.htm#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>  The Court also was concerned that the
OIC's investigation "could be impaired and prejudiced were the
Court to permit inquiry into the Lewinsky matter by the parties
in this civil case."<a href="5intro.htm#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>

<p>	On March 9, 1998, Judge Wright denied Ms. Jones's motion for
reconsideration of the decision regarding Monica Lewinsky.  The
order states:

<p>	The Court readily acknowledges that evidence of the Lewinsky
matter might have been relevant to plaintiff's case and, as
she argues, that such evidence might possibly have helped
her establish, among other things, intent, absence of
mistake, motive, and habit on the part of the President. .
.&nbsp;. Nevertheless, whatever relevance such evidence may
otherwise have . . . it simply is not essential to the core
issues in this case . . . .<a href="5intro.htm#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On April 1, 1998, Judge Wright granted President Clinton's
motion for summary judgment, concluding that even if the facts
alleged by Paula Jones were true, her claims failed as a matter
of law.<a href="5intro.htm#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  Ms. Jones has filed an appeal, and as of the date of
this Referral, the matter remains under consideration by the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

<p>	After the dismissal of Ms. Jones's lawsuit, the criminal
investigation continued.  It was (and is) the view of this Office
that any attempt to obstruct the proper functioning of the
judicial system, regardless of the perceived merits of the
underlying case, is a serious matter that warrants further
inquiry.  After careful consideration of all the evidence, the
OIC has concluded that the evidence of wrongdoing is substantial
and credible, and that the wrongdoing is of sufficient gravity
that it warrants referral to Congress.<a href="5intro.htm#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center><a name="L4"><strong>The Significance of the Evidence of Wrongdoing</strong></center>


<p>	It is not the role of this Office to determine whether the
President's actions warrant impeachment by the House and removal
by the Senate; those judgments are, of course, constitutionally
entrusted to the legislative branch.<a href="5intro.htm#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>  This Office is
authorized, rather, to conduct criminal investigations and to
seek criminal prosecutions for matters within its jurisdiction.<a href="5intro.htm#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a> 
In carrying out its investigation, however, this Office also has
a statutory duty to disclose to Congress information that "may
constitute grounds for an impeachment," a task that inevitably
requires judgment about the seriousness of the acts revealed by
the evidence.

<p>	From the beginning, this phase of the OIC's investigation
has been criticized as an improper inquiry into the President's
personal behavior; indeed, the President himself suggested that
specific inquiries into his conduct were part of an effort to
"criminalize my private life."<a href="5intro.htm#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>  The regrettable fact that the
investigation has often required witnesses to discuss sensitive
personal matters has fueled this perception.

<p>	All Americans, including the President, are entitled to
enjoy a private family life, free from public or governmental
scrutiny.  But the privacy concerns raised in this case are
subject to limits, three of which we briefly set forth here.

<p>	<u>First</u>.  The first limit was imposed when the President was
sued in federal court for alleged sexual harassment.  The
evidence in such litigation is often personal.  At times, that
evidence is highly embarrassing for both plaintiff and defendant. 
As Judge Wright noted at the President's January 1998 deposition,
"I have never had a sexual harassment case where there was not
some embarrassment."<a href="5intro.htm#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>  Nevertheless, Congress and the Supreme
Court have concluded that embarrassment-related concerns must
give way to the greater interest in allowing aggrieved parties to
pursue their claims.  Courts have long recognized the
difficulties of proving sexual harassment in the workplace,
inasmuch as improper or unlawful behavior often takes place in
private.<a href="5intro.htm#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>  To excuse a party who lied or concealed evidence on
the ground that the evidence covered only "personal" or "private"
behavior would frustrate the goals that Congress and the courts
have sought to achieve in enacting and interpreting the Nation's
sexual harassment laws.  That is particularly true when the
conduct that is being concealed -- sexual relations in the
workplace between a high official and a young subordinate
employee -- itself conflicts with those goals.

<p>	<u>Second</u>.  The second limit was imposed when Judge Wright
required disclosure of the precise information that is in part
the subject of this Referral.  A federal judge specifically
ordered the President, on more than one occasion, to provide the
requested information about relationships with other women,
including Monica Lewinsky.  The fact that Judge Wright later
determined that the evidence would not be admissible at trial,
and still later granted judgment in the President's favor, does
not change the President's legal duty at the time he testified. 
Like every litigant, the President was entitled to object to the
discovery questions, and to seek guidance from the court if he
thought those questions were improper.  But having failed to
convince the court that his objections were well founded, the
President was duty bound to testify truthfully and fully. 
Perjury and attempts to obstruct the gathering of evidence can
never be an acceptable response to a court order, regardless of
the eventual course or outcome of the litigation.

<p>	The Supreme Court has spoken forcefully about perjury and
other forms of obstruction of justice: 

<p>	In this constitutional process of securing a witness'
testimony, perjury simply has no place whatever.  Perjured
testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic
concepts of judicial proceedings.  Effective restraints
against this type of egregious offense are therefore
imperative.<a href="5intro.htm#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The insidious effects of perjury occur whether the case is civil
or criminal.  Only a few years ago, the Supreme Court considered
a false statement made in a civil administrative proceeding: 
"False testimony in a formal proceeding is intolerable.  We must
neither reward nor condone such a 'flagrant affront' to the
truth-seeking function of adversary proceedings. . . .  Perjury
should be severely sanctioned in appropriate cases."<a href="5intro.htm#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>  Stated
more simply, "[p]erjury is an obstruction of justice."<a href="5intro.htm#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>

<p>	<u>Third</u>.  The third limit is unique to the President.  "The
Presidency is more than an executive responsibility.  It is the
inspiring symbol of all that is highest in American purpose and
ideals."<a href="5intro.htm#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>  When he took the Oath of Office in 1993 and again in
1997, President Clinton swore that he would "faithfully execute
the Office of President."<a href="5intro.htm#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>  As the head of the Executive Branch,
the President has the constitutional duty to "take Care that the
Laws be faithfully executed."<a href="5intro.htm#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>  The President gave his testimony
in the <u>Jones</u> case under oath and in the presence of a federal
judge, a member of a co-equal branch of government; he then
testified before a federal grand jury, a body of citizens who had
themselves taken an oath to seek the truth.  In view of the
enormous trust and responsibility attendant to his high Office,
the President has a manifest duty to ensure that his conduct at
all times complies with the law of the land.<!--  As Justice Robert Jackson warned:
	No other personality in public life can begin to
compete with [the President] in access to the public
mind through modern methods of communications.  By his
prestige as head of state and his influence upon public
opinion he exerts a leverage upon those who are
supposed to check and balance his power which often
cancels their effectiveness.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>-->

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In sum, perjury and acts that obstruct justice by any
citizen -- whether in a criminal case, a grand jury
investigation, a congressional hearing, a civil trial, or civil
discovery -- are profoundly serious matters.  When such acts are
committed by the President of the United States, we believe those
acts "may constitute grounds for an impeachment."

<p><center><a name="L5"><strong>The Scope of the Referral</strong></center>


<p>	<a name="L6"><strong>1.  Background of the Investigation.  </strong>The link between the
OIC's jurisdiction -- as it existed at the end of 1997 -- and the
matters set forth in this Referral is complex but direct.  In
January 1998, Linda Tripp, a witness in three ongoing OIC
investigations, came forward with allegations that: (i) Monica
Lewinsky was planning to commit perjury in <u>Jones v. Clinton</u>, and
(ii) she had asked Ms. Tripp to do the same.  Ms. Tripp also
stated that: (i) Vernon Jordan had counseled Ms. Lewinsky and
helped her obtain legal representation in the <u>Jones</u> case, and
(ii) at the same time, Mr. Jordan was helping Ms. Lewinsky obtain
employment in the private sector.

<p>	OIC investigators and prosecutors recognized parallels
between Mr. Jordan's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his
earlier relationship with a pivotal Whitewater-Madison figure,
Webster L. Hubbell.  Prior to January 1998, the OIC possessed
evidence that Vernon Jordan -- along with other high-level
associates of the President and First Lady -- helped Mr. Hubbell
obtain lucrative consulting contracts while he was a potential
witness and/or subject in the OIC's ongoing investigation.  This
assistance took place, moreover, while Mr. Hubbell was a target
of a separate criminal investigation into his own conduct.  The
OIC also possessed evidence that the President and the First Lady
knew and approved of the Hubbell-focused assistance.

<p>	Specifically, in the wake of his April 1994 resignation from
the Justice Department, Mr. Hubbell launched a private consulting
practice in Washington, D.C.  In the startup process, Mr. Hubbell
received substantial aid from important public and private
figures.  On the day prior to Mr. Hubbell announcing his
resignation, White House Chief of Staff Thomas "Mack" McLarty
attended a meeting at the White House with the President, First
Lady, and others, where Mr. Hubbell's resignation was a topic of
discussion.

<p>	At some point after the White House meeting, Mr. McLarty
spoke with Vernon Jordan about Mr. Jordan's assistance to
Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell.  Mr. Jordan introduced Mr. Hubbell to senior
executives at New York-based MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holding Co. 
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan is a director of Revlon, Inc., a company controlled by
MacAndrews &amp; Forbes.  The introduction was successful; MacAndrews
&amp; Forbes retained Mr. Hubbell at a rate of $25,000 per quarter. 
Vernon Jordan informed President Clinton that he was helping
Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell.<a href="5intro.htm#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>

<p>	By late 1997, this Office was investigating whether a
relationship existed between consulting payments to Mr. Hubbell
and his lack of cooperation (specifically, his incomplete
testimony) with the OIC's investigation.<a href="5intro.htm#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>  In particular, the
OIC was investigating whether Mr. Hubbell concealed information
about certain core Arkansas matters, namely, the much-publicized
Castle Grande real estate project and related legal work by the
Rose Law Firm, including the First Lady.

<p>	Against this background, the OIC considered the January 1998
allegations that: (i) Ms. Lewinsky was prepared to lie in order
to benefit the President, and (ii) Vernon Jordan was assisting
Ms. Lewinsky in the <u>Jones</u> litigation, while simultaneously
helping her apply for a private-sector job with, among others,
Revlon, Inc.

<p>	Based in part on these similarities, the OIC undertook a
preliminary investigation.  On January 15, 1998, this Office
informed the Justice Department of the results of our inquiry. 
The Attorney General immediately applied to the Special Division
of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for
an expansion of the OIC's jurisdiction.  The Special Division
granted this request and authorized the OIC to determine whether
Monica Lewinsky or others had violated federal law in connection
with the <u>Jones v. Clinton</u> case.

<p>	<a name="L7"><strong>2.  Current Status of the Investigation.</strong>  When the OIC's
jurisdiction was expanded to cover the Lewinsky matter in January
1998, several matters remained under active investigation by this
Office.  Evidence was being gathered and evaluated on, among
other things, events related to the Rose Law Firm's
representation of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan Association;
events related to the firings in the White House Travel Office;
and events related to the use of FBI files.  Since the current
phase of the investigation began, additional events arising from
the Lewinsky matter have also come under scrutiny, including
possible perjury and obstruction of justice related to former
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey, and the possible misuse of
the personnel records of Pentagon employee Linda Tripp.

<p>	From the outset, it was our strong desire to complete all
phases of the investigation before deciding whether to submit to
Congress information -- if any -- that may constitute grounds for
an impeachment.  But events and the statutory command of Section
595(c) have dictated otherwise.  As the investigation into the
President's actions with respect to Ms. Lewinsky and the <u>Jones</u>
litigation progressed, it became apparent that there was a
significant body of substantial and credible information that met
the Section 595(c) threshold.  As that phase of the investigation
neared completion, it also became apparent that a delay of this
Referral until the evidence from all phases of the investigation
had been evaluated would be unwise.  Although Section 595(c) does
not specify when information must be submitted, its text strongly
suggests that information of this type belongs in the hands of
Congress as soon as the Independent Counsel determines that the
information is reliable and substantially complete.

<p>	All phases of the investigation are now nearing completion. 
This Office will soon make final decisions about what steps to
take, if any, with respect to the other information it has
gathered.  Those decisions will be made at the earliest practical
time, consistent with our statutory and ethical obligations.

<p align="center"><a name="L8"><strong>The Contents of the Referral</strong>

<p>	The Referral consists of several parts.  Part One is a
Narrative.  It begins with an overview of the information
relevant to this investigation, then sets forth that information
in chronological sequence.  A large part of the Narrative is
devoted to a description of the President's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.  The nature of the relationship was the subject
of many of the President's false statements, and his desire to
keep the relationship secret provides a motive for many of his
actions that apparently were designed to obstruct justice.

<p>	The Narrative is lengthy and detailed.  It is the view of
this Office that the details are crucial to an informed
evaluation of the testimony, the credibility of witnesses, and
the reliability of other evidence.  Many of the details reveal
highly personal information; many are sexually explicit.  This is
unfortunate, but it is essential.  The President's defense to
many of the allegations is based on a close parsing of the
definitions that were used to describe his conduct.  We have,
after careful review, identified no manner of providing the
information that reveals the falsity of the President's
statements other than to describe his conduct with precision.

<p>	Part Two of the Referral is entitled "Information that May
Constitute Grounds for An Impeachment."  This "Grounds" portion
of the Referral summarizes the specific evidence that the
President lied under oath and attempted to obstruct justice. 
This Part is designed to be understandable if read without the
Narrative, although the full context in which the potential
grounds for impeachment arise can best be understood if
considered against the backdrop of information set forth in Part
One.

<p>	Several volumes accompany the Referral.  The Appendix
contains relevant court orders, tables, a discussion of legal and
evidentiary issues, background information on the <u>Jones</u>
litigation, a diagram of the Oval Office, and other reference
material.  We next set forth a series of "Document Supplements,"
which attempt to provide some of the most important support
material in an accessible format.  Document Supplement A contains
transcripts of the President's deposition testimony and grand
jury testimony; Document Supplement B contains transcripts of
Monica Lewinsky's testimony and interview statements.  Document
Supplements C, D, and E set forth the full text of the documents
cited in the Referral.  Although every effort has been made to
provide full and accurate quotations of witnesses in their proper
context, we urge review of the full transcripts of the testimony
cited below.

in a December 18, 1997 Order, Judge Wright noted that "the issue
[was] one of discovery, not admissibility of evidence at trial. 
Discovery, as all counsel know, by its very nature takes
unforeseen twists and turns and goes down numerous paths, and
whether those paths lead to the discovery of admissible evidence
often simply cannot be predetermined."  1414-DC-00001012-13 (Dec.

<p><a name="N_18_">18. </a>  In the course of its investigation, the OIC gathered
information from a variety of sources, including the testimony of
witnesses before the grand jury.  Normally a federal prosecutor
is prohibited by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure from disclosing grand jury material, unless it obtains
permission from a court or is otherwise authorized by law to do
so.  This Office concluded that the statutory obligation of
disclosure imposed on an Independent Counsel by 28 U.S.C. &#167;595(c)
grants such authority.  Nevertheless, out of an abundance of
caution, the OIC obtained permission from the Special Division to
disclose grand jury material as appropriate in carrying out its
statutory duty.  A copy of the disclosure order entered by the
Special Division is set forth in the Appendix, Tab B.  We also
advised Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who supervises the
principal grand jury in this matter, of our determination on that
issue.

certain questions about his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky on the

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Others have argued that alleged "lies about sex" have
nothing to do with the President's performance in office, and
thus, are inconsequential.  Former White House Counsel Jack Quinn
articulated this view:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	This is a matter of sex between consenting adults, and the
question of whether or not one or the other was truthful
about it. . . .  This doesn't go to the question of his
conduct in office.  And, in that sense, it's trivial.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The President echoed this theme in his address to the Nation
on August 17, 1998, following his grand jury testimony:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	. . . I intend to reclaim my family life for my family. 
It's nobody's business but ours.  Even Presidents have
private lives.  It is time to stop the pursuit of personal
destruction and the prying into private lives and get on
with our national life.

<p><a name="N_22_">22. </a>  Clinton 1/17/98 Depo. at 9.  As two commentators have
noted: "[T]o the extent that discovery is permitted with respect
to the sexual activities of either the complainant or the alleged
harasser, courts likely will freely entertain motions to limit
the availability of such information to the parties and their
counsel and to prohibit general dissemination of such sensitive
data to third parties."  <u>See</u> Barbara Lindeman &amp; David D. Kadue,
<u>Sexual Harassment in Employment Law</u> 563 (1992).
<p><a name="N_23_">23. </a>  A sexual harassment case can sometimes boil down to a
credibility battle between the parties, in which "the existence
of corroborative evidence or the lack thereof is likely to be
crucial."  <u>Henson v. City of Dundee</u>, 682 F.2d 897, 912 n.25 (11th
Cir. 1982).  If there are no eyewitnesses, it can be critical for
a plaintiff to learn in discovery whether the defendant has
committed the same kind of acts before or since.  Thus, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission explained in a 1990 policy
statement that the plaintiff's allegations of an incident of
sexual harassment "would be further buttressed if other employees
testified that the supervisor propositioned them as well."  EEOC
Policy Guidance (1990).  The rules of evidence establish that
such corroboration may be used to show the defendant's "motive,
opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or
absence of mistake or accident."  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).  In
short, a defendant's sexual history, at least with respect to
other employees, is ordinarily discoverable in a sexual
harassment suit.

There is occasional misunderstanding to the effect that perjury
is somehow distinct from "obstruction of justice."  While the
crimes are distinct, they are in fact variations on a single
theme: preventing a court, the parties, and the public from
discovering the truth.  Perjury, subornation of perjury,
concealment of subpoenaed documents, and witness tampering are
all forms of obstruction of justice.
