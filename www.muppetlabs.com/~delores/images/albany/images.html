Oregon is a Class III state, God bless it, and there's a range down in
Albany that holds monthly Full-Auto competitions.  Trust me, it's
probably harder than you think.  Spraying bullets into a berm is one
thing, but having to use as little ammo as possible and quickly hit
targets [don't forget to control that muzzle rise] under time
pressure, etc, etc, is another.  Suffice to say, it's a lot of fun and 
I'm only decently good at it.  My goal is to just be able to hold my
own in a competition, and not be brushed off as being good ... "for a girl."
