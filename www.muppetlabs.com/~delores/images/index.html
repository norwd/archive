<p>
No matter what anyone else tells you, the Interweb&lt;tm kel&gt; was
designed for one purpose and one purpose only: sharing pictures of
your cat with perfect strangers.  I regret to inform that I currently
have no photos of Betty, so you'll have to live with the next best
thing: pictures of me shooting big [and not so big] guns for sport,
and other assorted mayhem.

<li><a href="marathon.jpg">Seattle Marathon 2000</a>
<br>Phoebe and I ran the Seattle Half Marathon this year.  It was
cold, it was rainy, it was damn early in the morning, and it was 13.1
miles.  This picture was taken about 10 or 20 feet in front of the
finish line.  I'm sure Phoebe will fondly recall wanting to kill me
because nearing the end, I grabbed her hand and starting sprinting
towards the finish line.  [In the photo, you can actually tell the
difference between our gait and the people around us.] Endorphins will
make a girl do funny things.

<li><a href="albanyopenshoot/images.html">December 2000 Albany Full Auto Open Shoot</a>
<br>Wintertime, and a young girl's heart turns to full-auto machine
guns.  The December 2000 shoot was damned fine fun - got to shoot a
Lahti, one of the 20mm Finnish anti-tank cannons immortalized in Ross'
"Unintended Consequences," the <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> of the gun
culture in more ways than one.
</li>
<li><a href="albany/images.html">Other Albany</a>
<br>In addition to the biannual Open Shoots, every month the Range
down in Albany, Oregon has a machine gun competition.  It's harder
than you might think.
</li>
<li><a href="broke100.jpg">Broke 100</a>
<br>Once upon a time, I broke 100 while bowling.  Ph34R M3!!  This
momentous event took place at Andre's birthday party.
</li>
<li><a href="crackpot/slimgunbearinghips.jpg">My CPL in action</a>
<br>This one probably doesn't need any commentary.
</li>
<li><a href="defcon/images.html">DEFCON 8 / Open Shoot</a>
<br>I don't even know who took some of these.  I went to DEFCON this year and
attended the DEFCON shoot, apparently someone snapped some photos of
me.  A friend found them randomly on the Interweb&lt;tm&gt; and sent
them to me.  Next year, i *will* bring a camera.
</li>
<li><a href="halloween/images.html">WSI Halloween 2000 shoot</a>
<br>This was so. much. fun.  Big kudos to the Man, Mr. Kel Whelan for
putting together a course that was not quite impossible to run in a
little short skirt and other hussy costume accessories.
</li>
<li><a href="family/images.html">Family</a>
<br>My family rocks ass.  'Nuff said.
</li>
<li><a href="sf/images.html">San Francisco<a>
<br>I'm about to get relocated down there for work, and these are some
photos from my first trip there.  If you're looking for proof of the
existance of God, it's that there are no photos from the *rest* of
this trip.

<li><a href="victoria/images.html">Atom Retreat 2000</a>
<br>Complete debauchery at the company retreat in Victoria, B.C.
Photos by Luke Jennings.
</li>
<li><a href="tacticalterri.avi">TacticalTerri.avi</a>
<br>The touching love story of a girl and her Colt 16" lightweight 
Match Target.  Warning: it's 13megs, and about a minute or so long.
</li>
<li><a 
href="../../~deadman/photo_albums/2001/index.html">NYE 2001</a>
<br>These are Deadman's pictures, so the commentary is much more
entertaining.  He's the Pretty and Witty drone, I'm the Sporty one.
And let's just pretend that you can't totally see through my shirt.
I would like to add that you couldn't see through it during the actual 
event  -- at least not that anyone told me -- but appears to have been
a camera/flash issue ... [And yes, I finally did fix that 404 error.  
Thanks, deadman!]
</li>
<li><a href="doctored/index.html">Knob Creek 2000</a>
<br>I didn't get to go to Knob Creek this year.  Bummer.  But with
this photo that Kel made, it's almost like I was there!
</li>
<li><a href="ljlastday/images.html">Atom's "Last Day"</a>
<br>When my employer announced the merger with shockwave, it ended up
being some people's last day of work.  Like good red-blooded high-tech
employees, this meant we were all over to Owl-n-Thistle before noon.
Luke Jennings took these photos, God bless 'em.
</li>
<li><a href="hlatomxmas/images.html">Atom's 2000 Xmas Party</a>
<br>Set one day after the pictures in the previous batch.  Go figure.
Henry Lee took these photos.
