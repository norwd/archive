<h3>Miscellaneous Non-textual Stuff</h3>
<p>
Most of my activity finds expression in textual media, but there are
occasionally exceptions. I've collected some of the exceptions here.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="sketch/index.html">My Cryptic Sketchbook</a>
<br/>
An opaque little codex that seems to be about &hellip; something.
<li>
<a href="tarot/index.html">The Cynical-Literalist's Tarot</a>
<br/>
A hand-drawn Major Arcana (of sorts).
<li>
<a href="fillets/index.html">Fish Fillets Solution Archive</a>
<br/>
Fish Fillets is a difficult puzzle game, originally written by Altar
Interactive and now available under the GPL.
<li>
<a href="sfcb/index.html">The Songfight Cover Bot</a>
<br/>
An automatic process that generates cover images for songfight.org.
<li>
<a href="breadbox.psf">My Linux console font</a>
<br/>
Some of the uglier characters in the default console font prompted me
to create my own. In addition to the usual support for the Latin-1
character set and the VT100 special characters, this font also covers
the full set of Latin-5, Latin-9, Windows-1252, and for good measure a
few of the more frequently used characters that only appear in IBM
codepage 437.
</ul>
