<dt><a href="txt/bure.html">Bootstrapping Understanding: An
Introduction to Reverse Engineering</a>
<dd><blockquote>
"In this essay I will walk through the process of reverse-engineering
some data files from an old computer game, in order to show you a
little bit of how it's done."
</blockquote>
<dt><a href="txt/acre.html">Cryptic Crossword: Amateur Crypto and
Reverse Engineering</a>
<dd><blockquote>
"If you've never tried to reverse-engineer a program before, you may
be wondering how one goes about such a task. The following essay
retraces one of the more colorful reverse-engineering problems that
I've pursued."
</blockquote>
<dt><a href="software/tiny/teensy.html">A Whirlwind Tutorial on
Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux</a>
<dd><blockquote>
"This document explores methods for squeezing excess bytes out of
simple programs. (Of course, the more practical purpose of this
document is to describe a few of the inner workings of the ELF file
format and the Linux operating system. But hopefully you can also
learn something about how to make really teensy ELF executables in the
process.)"
</blockquote>
<dt><a href="txt/rsa.html">Prime Number Hide-and-Seek: How the RSA
Cipher Works</a>
<dd><blockquote>
"This text explains the mathematics behind RSA -- how and why it works.
The intended audience is just about anyone who is interested in the
topic and who can remember a few basic facts from algebra: what a
variable is, the difference between a prime number and a composite
number, and the like."
</blockquote>
<dt><a href="txt/al.html">Short Words to Explain Relativity</a>
<dd><blockquote>
"Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity In Words of Four Letters or
Less"
</blockquote>
