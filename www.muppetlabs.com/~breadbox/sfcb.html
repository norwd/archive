<h1>About the Songfight Coverbot</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://songfight.org/">Songfight</a> is a venerable website
that takes a quick-moving, competitive approach to songwriting. A song
title is posted, and participants have seven to ten days to create a
new song with that title. Anyone can submit a song. After the deadline
has passed, the submissions are posted for people to listen to and
vote on. And again, anyone can vote.
</p>
<p>
The songfight website also allows people to submit "cover art", small
images to accompany the current song title. These are not voted on:
when it's time to post the submissions, the songfight webmasters
simply select the image that they like best.
</p>
<p>
A typical fight will see no more than two or three cover art
submissions. Sometimes, however, there are no cover art submissions,
and then the songfight webmasters will badger the community to remedy
this. Until something usable is provided, none of the musical
submissions can be posted. That's a potentially annoying situation for
everyone involved, and so I came up with the idea of remedying it with
a simple Python script that would automatically create cover art for
songfight titles, and semi-automatically submit them.
</p>
<p>
How does it work? Every few hours it examines the songfight home page,
and if it sees that a new fight has been posted, it grabs the fight
title and submits it to Google's image search engine. It then takes
the top ten results, crops the images to make them square, slaps the
title across the top, and saves them out to a set of files, along with
a web page so that the created images can be viewed. The web page
comes with submission buttons that let the reader submit one of the
created images as a cover for the current fight.
</p>
<p>
The initial version of my program produced a single image and
submitted it automatically, without any human involvement. Though
convenient for me, this approach tended to produce pretty low-quality
covers, and I felt had the potential to annoy the songfight
webmasters. Allowing human judgement to be exercised before the actual
submission not only increases the quality of the cover submitted, but
it also allows the program to submit nothing at all when perfectly
good covers by human beings have been submitted.
</p>
<p>
The program attempts to only use images that are not copyrighted and
are legally available for reuse with modification. Of course, this is
only as reliable as Google's filters are. My experience so far
suggests that they are surprisingly good, but I have no insight into
how this is done and so I can make no guarantees. (The program also
generates one cover with a purely abstract background, just in case
all other covers are unusuable for some reason.)
</p>
<p>
If you own something that you feel my program has used illegally, or
if you are having any other problems with the coverbot, please feel
free to contact me (breadbox) at this domain.
</p>
<p>
Note that only one image can be submitted for a given fight. So, if
you're looking at the page and it has more than one image you want to
submit, choose wisely.
