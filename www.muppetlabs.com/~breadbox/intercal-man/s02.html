"There's nothing like eating hay when you're faint," the White King
remarked to Alice, as he munched away.

"I should think throwing cold water over you would be better," Alice
suggested: "--or some sal-volatile."

"I didn't say there was nothing <em>better</em>," the King replied.
"I said there was nothing <em>like</em> it."  Which Alice did not

<h2>2.  Fundamental Concepts</h2>
<p>
In this section an attempt is made to describe how and why INTERCAL
may be used; i.e., what it is like and what it is good for.
<p>
<h3><a name="1">2.1</a>  Sample Program</h3>
<p>
Shown below is a relatively simple INTERCAL program which will read in
32-bit unsigned integers, treat them as signed, 2's-complement
numbers, and print out their absolute values.  The program exits if
the absolute value is zero.  Note in particular the inversion routine
(statements 6 through 14), which could be greatly simplified if the
subroutine library (see <a href="s07.html">section 7</a>) were used.
<p>
A more detailed analysis of a program is made in
<a href="s08.html">section 8</a>.

<h3><a name="2">2.2</a>  Uses for INTERCAL</h3>
<p>
INTERCAL's main advantage over other programming languages is its
strict simplicity.  It has few capabilities, and thus there are few
restrictions to be kept in mind.  Since it is an exceedingly easy
language to learn, one might expect it would be a good language for
initiating novice programmers.  Perhaps surprising, than, is the fact
that it would be more likely to initiate a novice into a search for
another line of work.  As it turns out, INTERCAL is more useful (which
isn't saying much) as a challenge to professional programmers.  Those
who doubt this need only refer back to the sample program in
<a href="s02.html#1">section 2.1</a>.  This 23-statement program took
somewhere from 15 to 30 minutes to write, whereas the same objectives
can be achieved by single-statement programs in either SNOBOL:
<p>
<pre>
        PLEASE INPUT POS(0) ('-' ! '')
        + (SPAN('0123456789') $ OUTPUT)
        + *NE(OUTPUT) :S(PLEASE)F(END)
</pre>
<p>
or APL:
<p>
<pre>
        <img alt="[1] -&gt;0!=[]&lt;-|[]" src="aplabs.gif">
</pre>
<p>
Admittedly, neither of these is likely to appear more intelligible to
anyone unfamiliar with the languages involved, but they took roughly
60 seconds and 15 seconds, respectively, to write.  Such is the
overwhelming power of INTERCAL!
<p>
The other major importance of INTERCAL lies in its seemingly
inexhaustible capacity for amazing one's fellow programmers,
confounding programming shop managers, winning friends, and
influencing people.  It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that
a person whose work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem.  For
example, if one were to state that the simplest way to store a value
of 65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is:
<p>
<pre>
        DO :1 &lt;- #0$#256
</pre>
<p>
any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd.  Since this is
indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look
foolish in front of his boss, who would of course happened to turn up,
as bosses are wont to do.  The effect would be no less devastating for
the programmer having been correct.
