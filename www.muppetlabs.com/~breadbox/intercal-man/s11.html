"Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice.  "I daresay
it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror."  (For,
with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how
long ago anything had happened.)

<h2>11.  The Atari Implementation</h2>
<p>
The Atari implementation of INTERCAL differs from the original
Princeton version primarily in the use of ASCII rather than EBCDIC.
Since there is no change sign (<code>&cent;</code>) in ASCII, we have
substituted the big money (<code>$</code>) as the mingle operator.  We
feel that this correctly represents the increasing cost of software in
relation to hardware.  (Consider that in 1970 one could get RUNOFF for
free, to run on a $20K machine, whereas today a not quite as powerful
formatter costs $99 and runs on a $75 machine.)  We also feel that
there should be no defensible contention that INTERCAL has any sense.
Also, since overpunches are difficult to read on the average VDT, the
exclusive-or operator may be written as what (<code>?</code>).  This
correctly expresses the average person's reaction on first
encountering exclusive-or, especially on a PDP-11.  Note that in both
of these cases, the over-punched symbol may also be used if one is
masochistic, or concerned with portability to the Princeton compiler.
The correct overpunch for change is
<samp>c</samp><var>&lt;backspace&gt;</var><samp>/</samp>; and the
correct overpunch for bookworm is
<samp>V</samp><var>&lt;backspace&gt;</var><samp>-</samp>.  These codes
will be properly printed if you have a proper printer, and the
corresponding EBCDIC code will be produced by the <samp>/IBM</samp>
option on the <samp>LIST</samp> command.
