"And yet it was a very clever pudding to invent."

"What did you mean it to be made of?" Alice asked, hoping to cheer him
up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.
<br>
"It began with blotting-paper," the Knight answered with a
groan.
<br>
"That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid--"
<br>
"Not very nice <em>alone</em>," he interrupted, quite eagerly, "but
you've no idea what a difference it makes, mixing it with other
things--such as gunpowder and sealing-wax."

<h2>10.  The C-INTERCAL Compiler</h2>
<p>
This section describes the use of <dfn>ick</dfn>, the C-INTERCAL
compiler.  Information specific to the other known INTERCAL compilers
appears in the following sections.  These sections are less useful,
since the other compilers are no longer available, but they are
retained to provide a sense of history, and because any information
regarding INTERCAL is really too scarce to discard.
<p>
<h3><a name="1">10.1</a>  Character Set</h3>
<p>
The C-INTERCAL compiler uses ASCII rather than EBCDIC.  We follow the
Atari implementation (see <a href="s11.html">section 11</a>) by (a)
using big money (<code>$</code>) as the mingle operator in place of
change (<code>&cent;</code>), and (b) using what (<code>?</code>) as
the XOR operator in place of bookworm
(<code>V</code><var>&lt;backspace&gt;</var><code>-</code>). The
original forms are still supported, in a manner of speaking: change
may be encoded via the Latin-1 character 0xA2, and the trigraph
<code>V</code> 0x08 <code>-</code> may be used to represent bookworm.
<p>
<h3><a name="2">10.2</a>  Usage and Compilation Options</h3>
<p>
To compile an INTERCAL program <samp>foo.i</samp> to executable code,
just do
<p>
<pre>
        ick foo.i
</pre>
<p>
There's a <samp>-c</samp> option that leaves the generated C code in
place for inspection (suppressing compilation to machine code), a
<samp>-d</samp> option that enables verbose parse reporting from the
yacc/bison parser, a <samp>-t</samp> option that requires strict
INTERCAL-72 compliance (rejecting <code>COME FROM</code> and the
extensions for bases other than two), a <samp>-b</samp> option that
disables the random-bug feature (error 774), and an <samp>-O</samp>
option that enables the (hah!) optimizer.  Invoking <samp>ick
-?</samp> prints a usage message.
<p>
Another compilation switch affects C-INTERCAL's runtime behavior.  The
<samp>-C</samp> option forces output in "clockface" mode, for
superstitious users who believe writing <samp>IV</samp> upside-down
offends IVPITER and would rather see <samp>IIII</samp>.
<p>
<h3><a name="3">10.3</a>  Runtime Options</h3>
<p>
Every C-INTERCAL runtime also accepts certain options at runtime.
These include [<samp>+</samp>/<samp>-</samp>]<samp>help</samp>,
[<samp>+</samp>/<samp>-</samp>]<samp>traditional</samp>, and
[<samp>+</samp>/<samp>-</samp>]<samp>wimpmode</samp>.  The
<samp>help</samp> option (with either <samp>+</samp> or
<samp>-</samp>) triggers a "usage" message.  The
<samp>+traditional</samp> option is presently a no-op.
<p>
Steve explains: "The <samp>wimpmode</samp> option is the most
interesting.  I found myself always running my test programs with
filters on both ends to work around the 'nifty' INTERCAL number
representations.  This was so painful that I decided it would be
<em>less</em> painful (and a lot less code) if I added a 'wimp'
option.  With the <samp>+wimpmode</samp> option, the user is subjected
to a humiliating message about what a wimp he or she is to use this
mode, but after that is allowed to use conventional numerical
notation.  While such a mode doubtless violates to some extent the
INTERCAL philosophy, the fact that an 'unbutcher' command has been
posted clearly indicates the need for it. Anyway ... if you don't like
it, don't use it.... the default is <samp>-wimpmode</samp> (i.e.
<em>not</em> wimp mode)."
<p>
<h3><a name="4">10.4</a>  PLEASE Politesse Checking</h3>
<p>
A feature of INTERCAL-72 not documented in the original manual was
that it required a certain level of politesse from the programmer.  If
fewer than 1/5th of the program statements included the
<code>PLEASE</code> qualifier, the program would be rejected as
insufficiently polite.  If more than 1/3rd of them included
<code>PLEASE</code>, the program would be rejected as excessively
polite.
<p>
This check has been implemented in C-INTERCAL.  To assist programmers
in coping with it, the intercal.el emacs mode included with the
distribution randomly expands "<samp>do </samp>" in entered source to
<code>PLEASE DO</code> 1/4th of the time.
<p>
<h3><a name="5">10.5</a>  Internationalization</h3>
<p>
The language recognized by the C-INTERCAL compiler includes several
extensions made with an eye to international usage.
<p>
Firstly, numerical
input is recognized in any of the following languages: English,
Sanskrit, Basque, Tagalog, Nahuatl, Georgian, Kwakiutl, and
Volap&uuml;k.
<p>
Secondly, the interleave operator, normally written as either change
(<code>&cent;</code>) or big money (<code>$</code>) can instead be
written, using the Latin-1 character set, as quid
(<code>&pound;</code>) or zlotnik (<code>&curren;</code>).
