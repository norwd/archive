"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.

"Oh, you ca'n't help that," said the Cat: "We're all mad here. I'm
mad. You're mad."

"How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice.

"You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."

<h2>1.  Introduction</h2>
<p>
The names you are about to ignore are true.  However, the story has
been changed significantly.  Any resemblance of the programming
language portrayed here to other programming languages, living or
dead, is purely coincidental.
<p>
<h3><a name="1">1.1</a> Origin and Purpose</h3>
<p>
The INTERCAL programming language was designed the morning of May 26,
1972 by <a href="http://www.iCynic.com/~don/">Donald R. Woods</a> and
James M. Lyon, at Princeton University.  Exactly when in the morning
will become apparent in the course of this manual.
<p>
Eighteen years later (give or take a few months)
<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a> perpetrated a
UNIX-hosted INTERCAL compiler as a weekend hack.  The C-INTERCAL
implementation has since been maintained and extended by an
international community of technomasochists, including
<a href="http://www.webcom.com/nazgul/welcome.html">Louis Howell</a>,
Steve Swales,
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mernst/">Michael
Ernst</a>, and <a href="../index.html">Brian
Raiter</a>.
<p>
(There was evidently an Atari implementation sometime between these
two; notes regarding it got appended to the INTERCAL-72 manual.  The
culprits have sensibly declined to identify themselves.)
<p>
INTERCAL was inspired by one ambition: to have a compiler language
which has nothing at all in common with any other major language.  By
"major" was meant anything with which the authors were at all
familiar, e.g., FORTRAN, BASIC, COBOL, ALGOL, SNOBOL, SPITBOL, FOCAL,
SOLVE, TEACH, APL, LISP, and PL/I.  For the most part, INTERCAL has
remained true to this goal, sharing only the basic elements such as
variables, arrays, and the ability to do I/O, and eschewing all
conventional operations other than the assignment statement (FORTRAN
<code>=</code>).
<p>
<h3><a name="2">1.2</a> Acronym</h3>
<p>
The full name of the compiler is "Compiler Language With No
Pronounceable Acronym", which is, for obvious reasons, abbreviated
"INTERCAL".
<p>
<h3><a name="3">1.3</a> Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>
The authors are deeply indebted to Eric M. Van and Daniel J.
Warmenhoven, without whose unwitting assistance this manual would
still have been possible.
