<h2>6.  TriINTERCAL et al.</h2>
<p>
In which it is revealed that bitwise operations are too ordinary for
hard-core INTERCAL programmers, and extensions to other bases are
discussed.  These are not, strictly speaking, extensions to INTERCAL
itself, but rather new dialects sharing most of the features of the
parent language.
<p>
<h3><a name="1">6.1</a>  Motivation</h3>
<p>
INTERCAL is really a pretty sissy language.  It tries hard to be
different, but when you get right down to its roots, what do you find?
You find bits, that's what.  Plain old ones and zeroes, in groups of
16 and 32, just like every other language you've ever heard of.  And
what operations can you perform on these bits?  The INTERCAL operators
may arrange and permute them in weird and wonderful ways, but at the
bit level the operators are the same AND, OR and XOR you've seen
countless times before.
<p>
Once the prospective INTERCAL programmer masters the unusual syntax,
she finds herself working with the familiar Boolean operators on
perfectly ordinary unsigned integer words.  Even the constants she
uses are familiar.  After all, who would not immediately recognize
<code>#65535</code> and <code>#32768</code>?  It may take a just a
moment more to figure out <code>#65280</code>, and <code>#21845</code>
and <code>#43690</code> could be puzzles until she notices that they
sum to <code>#65535</code>, but basically she's still on her home
turf.  The 16-bit limit on constants actually works in the
programmer's favor by insuring that very long anonymous constants can
not appear in INTERCAL programs.  And this is in a language that is
supposed to be different from any other!
<p>
<h3><a name="2">6.2</a>  Abandon All Hope...</h3>
<p>
Standard INTERCAL is based on variables consisting of ordinary bits
and familiar Boolean operations on those bits.  In pursuit of
uniqueness, it seems appropriate to provide a new dialect, otherwise
identical to INTERCAL, which instead uses variables consisting of
trits, i.e.  ternary digits, and operators based on tritwise logical
operations.  This is intended to be a separate dialect, rather than an
extension to INTERCAL itself, for a number of reasons.  Doing it this
way avoids word-length conflicts, does not spoil the elegance of the
Spartan INTERCAL operator set, and dodges the objections of those who
might feel it too great an alteration to the original language.
Primarily, though, giving INTERCAL programmers the ability to switch
numeric base at will amounts to excessive functionality.  So much
better that a programmer choose a base at the outset and then be
forced to stick with it for the remainder of the program.
<p>
<h3><a name="3">6.3</a>  Compiler Operation</h3>
<p>
The same compiler, ick, supports both INTERCAL and TriINTERCAL.  This
has the advantage that future bug fixes and additions to the language
not related to arithmetic immediately apply to both versions.  The
compiler recognizes INTERCAL source files by the extension
<samp>.i</samp>, and TriINTERCAL source files by the extension
<samp>.3i</samp>.  It's as simple as that.  There is no way to mix
INTERCAL and TriINTERCAL source in the same program, and it is not
always possible to determine which dialect a program is written in
just by looking at the source code.
<p>
<h3><a name="4">6.4</a>  Data Types</h3>
<p>
The two TriINTERCAL data types are 10-trit unsigned integers and
20-trit unsigned integers.  All INTERCAL syntax for distinguishing
data types is ported to these new types in the obvious way.  Small
words may contain numbers from <code>#0</code> to <code>#59048</code>;
large words may contain numbers from <code>#0$#0</code> to
<code>#59048$#59048</code>.  Errors are signaled for constants greater
than <code>#59048</code> and for attempts to <code>WRITE IN</code>
numbers too large for a given variable or array element to hold.
<p>
Note that though TriINTERCAL considers all numbers to be unsigned,
nothing prevents the programmer from implementing arithmetic
operations that treat their operands as signed.  Three's complement is
one obvious choice, but balanced ternary notation is also a
possibility.  This latter is a very pretty and symmetrical system in
which all 2 trits are treated as if they had the value -1.
<p>
<h3><a name="5">6.5</a>  Operators</h3>
<p>
The TriINTERCAL operators are designed to inherit the relevant
properties of the standard INTERCAL operators, so that both can be
considered as merely different aspects of the same Platonic ideal.
(Not that the word "ideal" is ever particularly relevant when used in
connection with INTERCAL.)
<p>
<h4><a name="5.1">6.5.1</a>  Binary Operators I</h4>
<p>
The binary operators carry over from the original language with only
minor changes.  The mingle operator (<code>$</code>) creates a 20-trit
word by alternating trits from its two 10-trit operands.  The select
operator (<code>~</code>) is a little more complicated, since the
ternary tritmask may contain 0, 1, and 2 trits.  If we observe that
the select operation on binary operands amounts to a bitwise AND and
some rearrangement of bits, it seems appropriate to base the select
for ternary operands on a tritwise AND in the analogous fashion.  We
therefore postpone the definition of select until we know what a
tritwise AND looks like.
<p>
<h4><a name="5.2">6.5.2</a>  Unary Operators</h4>
<p>
The unary operators in INTERCAL are all derived from the familiar
Boolean operations on single bits.  To extend these operations to
trits, we first ask ourselves what the important properties of these
operations are that we wish to be preserved, then design the tritwise
operators so that they behave in a similar fashion.
<p>
<h5><a name="5.2.1">6.5.2.1</a>  Unary Logical Operators</h5>
<p>
Let's start with AND and OR.  To begin with, these can be considered
"choice" or "preference" operators, as they always return one of their
operands.  AND can be described as wanting to return 0, but returning
1 if it is given no other choice, i.e., if both operands are 1.
Similarly, OR wants to return 1 but returns 0 if that is its only
choice.  From this it is immediately apparent that each operator has
an identity element that "always loses", and a dominator element that
"always wins".
<p>
AND and OR are commutative and associative, and each distributes over
the other.  They are also symmetric with each other, in the sense that
AND looks like OR and OR looks like AND when the roles of 0 and 1 are
interchanged (De Morgan's Laws).  This symmetry property seems to be a
key element to the idea that these are logical, rather than
arithmetic, operators.  In a three-valued logic we would similarly
expect a three- way symmetry among the three values 0, 1 and 2 and the
three operators <dfn>AND</dfn>, <dfn>OR</dfn> and (of course)
<dfn>BUT</dfn>.
<p>
The following tritwise operations have all the desired properties: OR
returns the greater of its two operands.  That is, it returns 2 if it
can get it, else it tries to return 1, and it returns 0 only if both
operands are 0.  AND wants to return 0, will return 2 if it can't get
0, and returns 1 only if forced.  BUT wants 1, will take 0, and tries
to avoid 2.  The equivalents to De Morgan's Laws apply to rotations of
the three elements, e.g., 0 <samp>-&gt;</samp> 1, 1 <samp>-&gt;</samp>
2, 2 <samp>-&gt;</samp> 0.  Each operator distributes over exactly one
other operator, so the property "X distributes over Y" is not
transitive.  The question of which way this distributivity ring goes
around is left as an exercise for the student.
<p>
In TriINTERCAL programs the whirlpool (<code>@</code>) denotes the
unary tritwise BUT operation.  You can think of the whirlpool as
drawing values preferentially towards the central value 1.
Alternatively, you can think of it as drawing your soul and your
sanity inexorably down....
<p>
On the other hand, maybe it's best you <em>not</em> think of it that
way.
<p>
A few comments about how these operators can be used.  OR acts like a
tritwise maximum operation.  AND can be used with tritmasks.  0's in a
mask wipe out the corresponding elements in the other operand, while
1's let the corresponding elements pass through unchanged.  2's in a
mask consolidate the values of nonzero elements, as both 1's and 2's
in the other operand yield 2's in the output.  BUT can be used to
create "partial tritmasks".  0's in a mask let BUT eliminate 2's from
the other operand while leaving other values unchanged.  Of course,
the symmetry property guarantees that the operators don't really
behave differently from each other in any fundamental way; the
apparent differences come from the intuitive view that a 0 trit is
"not set" while a 1 or 2 trit is "set".
<p>
<h5><a name="5.2.2">6.5.2.2</a>  Binary Operators II</h5>
<p>
At this point we can define select, since we now know what the
tritwise AND looks like.  Select takes the binary tritwise AND of its
two operands.  It shifts all the trits of the result corresponding to
2's in the right operand over to the right (low) end of the result,
then follows them with all the output trits corresponding to 1's in
the right operand.  Trits corresponding to 0's in the right operand,
which are all 0 anyway, occupy the remaining space at the left end of
the output word.  Both 10-trit and 20-trit operands are accepted, and
are padded with zeroes on the left if necessary.  The output type is
determined the same way as in standard INTERCAL.
<p>
<h5><a name="5.2.3">6.5.2.3</a>  Unary Arithmetic Operators</h5>
<p>
Now that we've got all that settled, what about XOR?  This is easily
the most-useful of the three unary INTERCAL operators, because it
combines in one package the operations add without carry, subtract
without borrow, bitwise not-equal, and bitwise not.  In TriINTERCAL we
can't have all of these in the same operator, since addition and
subtraction are no longer the same thing.  The solution is to split
the XOR concept into two operators.  The add without carry operation
is represented by the new sharkfin (<code>^</code>), while the old
what (<code>?</code>) represents subtract without borrow.  The reason
for this choice is so that what will also represent the tritwise
not-equal operation.
<p>
Note that what (<code>?</code>), unlike the other four unary
operators, is not symmetrical.  It should be thought of as rotating
its operand one trit to the right (with wraparound) and then
subtracting off the trits of the original number.  These subtractions
are done without borrowing, i.e., trit-by-trit modulo 3.
<p>
<h4><a name="5.3">6.5.3</a>  Examples</h4>
<p>
The TriINTERCAL operators really aren't all that bad once you get used
to them.  Let's look at a few examples to show how they can be used in
practice.  In all of these examples the input value is contained in
the 10-trit variable <code>.3</code>.  (For similar examples of the
base 2 operators, see <a href="s08.html#2">section 8.2</a>.)
<p>
In INTERCAL, single-bit values often have to be converted from {0,1}
to {1,2} for use in <code>RESUME</code> statements.  Examples of how
to do this appear in the original manual.  In TriINTERCAL the
expression <code>"^.3$#1"~#1</code> sends 0 <samp>-&gt;</samp> 1 and 1
<samp>-&gt;</samp> 2.  If the 1-trit input value can take on any of
its three possible states, however, we will also have to deal with the
2 case.  The expression <code>"V.3$#1"~#1</code> sends {0,1}
<samp>-&gt;</samp> 1 and 2 <samp>-&gt;</samp> 2.  To test if a trit is
set, we can use <code>"V'"&amp;.3$#2"~#1'$#1"~#1</code>, sending 0
<samp>-&gt;</samp> 1 and {1,2} <samp>-&gt;</samp> 2.  To reverse the
test we use <code>"?'"&amp;.3$#2"~#1'$#1"~#1</code>, sending 0
<samp>-&gt;</samp> 2 and {1,2} <samp>-&gt;</samp> 1.  Note that we
have not been taking full advantage of the new select operator.  These
last two expressions can be simplified into
<code>"V!3~#2'$#1"~#1</code> and <code>"?!3~#2'$#1"~#1</code>, which
perform exactly the same mappings.  Finally, if we need a 3-way test,
we can use <code>"@'"^.3$#7"~#4'$#2"~#10</code>, which obviously sends
0 <samp>-&gt;</samp> 1, 1 <samp>-&gt;</samp> 2, and 2
<samp>-&gt;</samp> 3.
<p>
For an unrelated example, the expression
<code>"^.3$.3"~"#0$#29524"</code> converts all of the 1-trits of .3
into 2's and all of the 2-trits into 1's.  In balanced ternary, where
2-trits represent -1 values, this is the negation operation.
<p>
<h3><a name="6">6.6</a>  Beyond Ternary</h3>
<p>
While we're at it, we might as well extend this multiple bases
business a little farther.  The ick compiler actually recognizes
filename suffixes of the form
<samp>.</samp><var>N</var><samp>i</samp>, where <var>N</var> is any
number from 2 to 7.  2 of course gives standard INTERCAL, while 3
gives TriINTERCAL.  We cut off before 8 because octal notation is the
smallest base used to facilitate human-to-machine communication, and
this seems quite contrary to the basic principles behind INTERCAL.
The small data types hold 16 bits, 10 trits, 8 quarts, 6 quints, 6
sexts, or 5 septs, and the large types are always twice this size.
<p>
As for operators, <code>?</code> is always subtract without borrow,
and <code>^</code> is always add without carry.  <code>V</code> is the
OR operation and always returns the max of its inputs.
<code>&amp;</code> is the AND operation, which chooses 0 if possible
but otherwise returns the max of the inputs.  <code>@</code> is BUT,
which prefers 1, then 0, then the max of the remaining possibilities.
Rather than add more special symbols forever, a numeric modifier may
be placed directly before the <code>@</code> to indicate the operation
that prefers one of the digits not already represented.  Thus in files
ending in <samp>.5i</samp>, the permitted unary operators are
<code>?</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>@</code>,
<code>2@</code>, <code>3@</code>, and <code>V</code>.  Use of such
barbarisms as <code>0@</code> to represent <code>&amp;</code> are not
permitted, nor is the use of <code>@</code> or <code>^</code> in files
with either of the extensions <samp>.i</samp> or <samp>.2i</samp>.
Why not?  You just can't, that's why.  Don't ask so many questions.
<p>
As a closing example, we note that in balanced quinary notation, where
3 means -2 and 4 means -1, the negation operation can be written as
either
<p>
<pre>
        DO .1 &lt;- "^'"^.3$.3"~"#0$#3906"'$'"^.3$.3"~"#0$#3906"'"~"#0$#3906"
</pre>
<p>
or as
<p>
<pre>
        DO .1 &lt;- "^.3$.3"~"#0$#3906"
        DO .1 &lt;- "^.1$.1"~"#0$#3906"
</pre>
<p>
These work because multiplication by -1 is the same as multiplication
by 4, modulo 5.
<p>
Now go beat your head against the wall for a while.
