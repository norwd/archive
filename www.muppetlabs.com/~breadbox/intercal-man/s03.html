"I quite agree with you," said the Duchess; "and the moral of that
is--'Be what you would seem to be'--or, if you'd like it put more
simply--'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise."
<br>
"I think I should understand that better," Alice said very
politely, "if I had it written down: but I ca'n't quite follow
it as you say it."
<br>
"That's nothing to what I could say if I chose," the Duchess
replied, in a pleased tone.

<h2>3.  Description</h2>
<p>
The examples of INTERCAL programming which have appeared in the
preceding sections of this manual have probably seemed highly esoteric
to the reader unfamiliar with the language.  With the aim of making
them more so, we present here a description of INTERCAL.
<p>
<h3><a name="1">3.1</a>  Variables</h3>
<p>
INTERCAL allows only 2 different types of variables, the <dfn>16-bit
integer</dfn> and the <dfn>32-bit integer</dfn>.  These are
represented by a spot (<code>.</code>) or two-spot (<code>:</code>),
respectively, followed by any number between <code>1</code> and
<code>65535</code>, inclusive.  These variables may contain only
non-negative numbers; thus they have the respective ranges of values:
0 to 65535 and 0 to 4294967295.  Note: <code>.123</code> and
<code>:123</code> are two distinct variables.  On the other hand,
<code>.1</code> and <code>.0001</code> are identical.  Furthermore,
the latter may <em>not</em> be written as <code>1E-3</code>.
<p>
<h3><a name="2">3.2</a>  Constants</h3>
<p>
Constants are 16-bit values only and may range from <code>0</code> to
<code>65535</code>.  They are prefixed by a mesh (<code>#</code>).
Caution!  Under no circumstances confuse the mesh with the interleave
operator, except under confusing circumstances!
<p>
<h3><a name="3">3.3</a>  Arrays</h3>
<p>
Arrays are represented by a tail (<code>,</code>) for 16-bit values,
or a hybrid (<code>;</code>) for 32-bit values, followed by a number
between <code>1</code> and <code>65535</code>, inclusive.  The number
is suffixed by the word <code>SUB</code>, followed by the subscripts,
separated optionally by spaces.  Subscripts may be any expressions,
including those involving subscripted variables. This occasionally
leads to ambiguous constructions, which are resolved as discussed in
<a href="s03.html#4.3">section 3.4.3</a>.  Definition of array dimensions will
be discussed later in greater detail, since discussing it in less
detail would be difficult.  As before, <code>,123</code> and
<code>;123</code> are distinct.  In summary, <code>.123</code>,
<code>:123</code>, <code>#123</code>, <code>,123</code>, and
<code>;123</code> are all distinct.
<p>
<h3><a name="4">3.4</a>  Operators</h3>
<p>
INTERCAL recognizes 5 operators--2 binary and 3 unary.
<a href="s03.html#fn1">*</a> Please be kind to our operators: they may not be
very intelligent, but they're all we've got.  In a sense, all 5
operators are binary, as they are all bit-oriented, but it is not our
purpose here to quibble about bits of trivia.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.1">3.4.1</a>  Binary Operators</h4>
<p>
The binary operators are <dfn>interleave</dfn> (also called
<dfn>mingle</dfn>) and <dfn>select</dfn>, which are represented by a
big money (<code>$</code>) and a sqiggle [sic] (<code>~</code>),
respectively.
<p>
The interleave operator takes two 16-bit values and produces a 32-bit
result by alternating the bits of the operands.  Thus,
<code>#65535$#0</code> has the 32-bit binary form 101010....10 or
2863311530 decimal, while <code>#0$#65535</code> = 0101....01 binary =
1431655765 decimal, and <code>#255$#255</code> is equivalent to
<code>#65535</code>.
<p>
(Note that INTERCAL-72 used change (<code>&cent;</code>) to represent
interleave. For C-INTERCAL's non-EBCDIC environment, big money has
been substituted, but change can still be used via the Latin-1
character 0xA2. Since the majority of extant INTERCAL is written in
ASCII, big money is used throughout this document. See also
<a href="s10.html#1">section 10.1</a> and <a href="s11.html">section
11</a>.)
<p>
The select operator takes from the first operand whichever bits
correspond to 1's in the second operand, and packs these bits to the
right in the result.  Both operands are automatically padded on the
left with zeros to 32 bits before the selection takes place, so the
variable types are unrestricted.  The resulting value will have the
same type as the second operand.  For example, <code>#179~#201</code>
(binary value 10110011<code>~</code>11001001) selects from the first
argument the 8th, 7th, 4th, and 1st from last bits, namely, 1001,
which = 9.  But <code>#201~#179</code> selects from binary 11001001
the 8th, 6th, 5th, 2nd, and 1st from last bits, giving 10001 = 17.
<code>#179~#179</code> has the value 31, while <code>#201~#201</code>
has the value 15.
<p>
<a name="diagramret"></a> Perhaps a simpler way of understanding the
operation of the select operator would be to examine the logic diagram
in <a href="figure1.html">Figure 1</a>, which performs the select
operation upon two 8-bit values, A and B.  The gates used are
Warmenhovian logic gates, which means the outputs have four possible
values: low, high, undefined (value of an uninitialized flip-flop),
and oscillating (output of a NOR gate with one input low and the other
input connected to the output). These values are represented
symbolically by '0', '1', '?', and '&Oslash;'.  Note in particular that,
while NOT-0 is 1 and NOT-1 is 0 as in two-valued logic, NOT-? is ? and
NOT-&Oslash; is &Oslash;.  The functions of the various gates are listed
in <a href="table1.html">Table 1</a>.
<p>
<h5><a name="4.1.1">3.4.1.1</a>  Return type of SELECT</h5>
<p>
INTERCAL-72 defined the return type of a select operation to depend on
the number of bits selected.  That is, if the second operand was a
32-bit variable, but had 15 or fewer bits set to 1, the result would
be a 16-bit value.  The C-INTERCAL compiler takes the easier route of
defining the return type to be that of the right operand, independent
of its actual value.  This form has the advantage that all types can
be determined at compile time.  Putting in run-time type-checking
would add significant overhead and complication, to effect a very
minor change in language semantics.
<p>
The only time this distinction makes any difference is when a unary
operator is applied to the select result.  This happens extremely
rarely in practice, the only known instance being the 32-bit
greater-than test in the standard library, where an XOR operator is
applied to the result of selecting a number against itself.  The
INTERCAL-72 authors select the result against
<code>#65535$#65535</code>, which has no effect in C-INTERCAL, but in
the original language it ensures that XOR sees a 32-bit value.
<p>
The cautious programmer should write code that does not depend on the
compiler version being used.  We therefore suggest the following
guideline for determining the select return type.  A select operation
with a 16-bit right operand returns a 16-bit value.  The return type
of a select operation with a 32-bit right operand is undefined, but is
guaranteed to be an acceptable input to a mingle operation so long as
16 or fewer bits are actually selected.  Correct code should not
depend on whether the return type is 16 or 32 bits.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.2">3.4.2</a> Unary Operators</h4>
<p>
The unary operators are ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) (logical
<dfn>AND</dfn>), V (or book) (<code>V</code>) (logical <dfn>OR</dfn>),
and what (<code>?</code>) (logical <dfn>XOR</dfn>). The operator is
inserted between the spot, two-spot, mesh, or what-have-you, and the
integer, thus: <code>.&amp;123</code>, <code>#?123</code>.  Multiple
unary operators may not be concatenated, thus the form
<code>#?&amp;123</code> is invalid.  This will be covered later when
precedence is discussed.  These operators perform their respective
logical operations on all pairs of adjacent bits, the result from the
first and last bits going into the first bit of the result.  The
effect is that of rotating the operand one place to the right and
ANDing, ORing, or XORing with its initial value.  Thus,
<code>#&amp;77</code> (binary = 1001101) is binary 0000000000000100 =
4, <code>#V77</code> is binary 1000000001101111 = 32879, and
<code>#?77</code> is binary 1000000001101011 = 32875.
<p>
(INTERCAL-72 used the bookworm character to represent XOR, which was
obtained by overpunching a worm (<code>-</code>) on a V
(<code>V</code>).  Since the average user of C-INTERCAL is unlikely to
be using a card puncher to submit their programs, and as the modern
VDT is notorious for poor rendering of overstrikes, <code>?</code> is
used in its place.  However, the C-INTERCAL compiler will recognize
the <samp>V</samp><var>&lt;backspace&gt;</var><samp>-</samp> trigraph
as equivalent notation. See also <a href="s10.html#1">section 10.1</a>
and <a href="s11.html">section 11</a>.)
<p>
<h4><a name="4.3">3.4.3</a> Precedence</h4>
<p>
Precedence of operators is as follows:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">
(This space intentionally left blank) <a href="s03.html#fn2">**</a>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This precedence (or lack thereof) may be overruled by grouping
expressions between pairs of sparks (<code>'</code>) or rabbit-ears
(<code>"</code>).  Thus <code>'#165$#203'~#358</code> (binary value
<code>'</code>10100101<code>$</code>11001011<code>'~</code>101100110)
has the value 15, but <code>#165$'#203~#358'</code> has the value
34915, and <code>#165$#203~#358</code> is invalid syntax and is
completely valueless (except perhaps as an educational tool to the
programmer).  A unary operator is applied to a sparked or rabbit-eared
expression by inserting the operator immediately following the opening
spark or ears.  Thus, the invalid expression <code>#?&amp;123</code>,
which was described earlier, could be coded as
<code>'?#&amp;123'</code> or <code>'?"&amp;#123"'</code>.  Note: In
the interests of simplifying the sometimes overly-complex form of
expressions, INTERCAL allows a spark-spot combination
(<code>'.</code>) to be replaced with a wow (<code>!</code>).  Thus
<code>'.1~.2'</code> is equivalent to <code>!1~.2'</code>, and
<code>'V.1$.2'</code> is equivalent to <code>"V!1$.2'"</code>.
<p>
Combining a rabbit-ears with a spot to form a rabbit is not permitted,
although the programmer is free to use it should he find an EBCDIC
reader which will properly translate a 12-3-7-8 punch.
<p>
Sparks and/or rabbit-ears must also be used to distinguish among such
otherwise ambiguous subscripted and multiply-subscripted expressions
as:
<p>
<pre>
        ,1 SUB #1 ~ #2
        ,1 SUB ,2 SUB #1 #2 #3
        ,1 SUB " ,2 SUB " ,3 SUB #1 " #2 " " #3 "
</pre>
<p>
The third case may be isolated into either of its possible
interpretations by simply changing some pairs of rabbit-ears to
sparks, instead of adding more ears (which would only confuse the
issue further).  Ambiguous cases are defined as those for which the
compiler being used finds a legitimate interpretation which is
different from that which the user had in mind.  See also

was to have no precedents.
