"There's glory for you!"

"I don't know what you mean by 'glory,'" Alice said.
<br>
Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously.  "Of course you don't--till I
tell you. I meant 'there's a nice knock-down argument for you!'"
<br>
"But 'glory' doesn't mean 'a nice knock-down argument.'" Alice
objected.
<br>
"When <em>I</em> use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful
tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less."

<h2>4.  Statements</h2>
<p>
In this section is described the format of INTERCAL statements.
<p>
<h3><a name="1">4.1</a>  General Format</h3>
<p>
Statements may be entered in "free format".  That is, more than one
statement may occur on a single card (or line), and a statement may
begin on one card (line) and end on a later one.  Note that if this is
done, all intervening cards and portions thereof must be part of the
same statement.  That this restriction is necessary is immediately
apparent from the following example of what might occur if statements
could be interlaced.
<p>
<pre>
        DO .1 &lt;- ".1$'&amp;:51~"#?1$!12~;&amp;75SUB"?'V.1~
        DO .2 &lt;- '"!1$"&amp;';?79SUB",&amp;7SUB:173"'~!?9$
        .2'$,&amp;1SUB:5~#33578"'"'"~'#65535$"?'V#&amp;85'"'
        #8196'"'~.1"$.2'~'#&amp;5$"'#1279$#4351'~#65535"'
</pre>
<p>
The above statements are obviously meaningless.  (For that matter, so
are the statements
<p>
<pre>
        DO .1 &lt;- ".1$'&amp;:51~"#?1$!12~;&amp;75SUB"?'V.1~
        .2'$,&amp;1SUB:5~#33578"'"'"~'#65535$"?'V#&amp;85'"'
        DO .2 &lt;- '"!1$"&amp;';?79SUB",&amp;7SUB:173"'~!?9$
        #8196'"'~.1"$.2'~'#&amp;5$"'#1279$#4351'~#65535"'
</pre>
<p>
but this is not of interest here.)
<p>
Spaces may be used freely to enhance program legibility (or at least
reduce program illegibility), with the restriction that no word of a
statement identifier (see <a href="s04.html#3">section 4.3</a>) may contain
any spaces.
<p>
<h3><a name="2">4.2</a>  Labels</h3>
<p>
A statement may begin with a <dfn>logical line label</dfn> enclosed in
wax-wane pairs (<code>()</code>).  A statement may not have more than
one label, although it is possible to omit the label entirely.  A line
label is any integer from <code>1</code> to <code>65535</code>, which
must be unique within each program.  The user is cautioned, however,
that many line labels between <code>1000</code> and <code>1999</code>
are used in the INTERCAL System Library functions.
<p>
<h3><a name="3">4.3</a>  Identifiers and Qualifiers</h3>
<p>
After the line label (if any), must follow one of the following
statement identifiers: <code>DO</code>, <code>PLEASE</code>, or
<code>PLEASE DO</code>.  These may be used interchangeably to improve
the aesthetics of the program.  The identifier is then followed by
either, neither, or both of the following optional parameters
(qualifiers): (1) either of the character strings <code>NOT</code> or
<code>N'T</code>, which causes the statement to be automatically
abstained from (see <a href="s04.html#4.9">section 4.4.9</a>) when execution
begins, and (2) a number between <code>0</code> and <code>100</code>,
preceded by a double-oh-seven (<code>%</code>), which causes the
statement to have only the specified percent chance of being executed
each time it is encountered in the course of execution.
<p>
<h3><a name="4">4.4</a>  Statements</h3>
<p>
Following the qualifiers (or, if none are used, the identifier) must
occur one of the 14 valid operations.  (Exception: see
<a href="s04.html#5">section 4.5</a>.)  These are described individually in
the following sections.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.1">4.4.1</a>  Calculate</h4>
<p>
The INTERCAL equivalent of the half-mesh (<code>=</code>) in FORTRAN,
BASIC, PL/I, and others, is represented by an angle
(<code>&lt;</code>) followed by a worm (<code>-</code>).  This
combination is read "gets".  32-bit variables may be assigned 16-bit
values, which are padded on the left with 16 zero bits.  16-bit
variables may be assigned 32-bit values only if the value is less than
65535.  Thus, to invert the least significant bit of the first element
of 16-bit 2-dimensional array number 1, one could write:
<p>
<pre>
	,1SUB#1#1 &lt;- '?",1SUB#1#1"$#1'~'#0$#65535'
</pre>
<p>
Similarly to SNOBOL and SPITBOL, INTERCAL uses the angle-worm to
define the dimensions of arrays.  An example will probably best
describe the format.  To define 32-bit array number 7 as
3-dimensional, the first dimension being seven, the second being the
current value of 16-bit variable number seven, and the third being the
current value of the seventh element of 16-bit array number seven
(which is one-dimensional) mingled with the last three bits of 32-bit
variable number seven, one would write (just before they came to take
him away):
<p>
<pre>
	;7 &lt;- #7 BY .7 BY ",7SUB#7"$':7~#7'
</pre>
<p>
This is, of course, different from the statement:
<p>
<pre>
	;7 &lt;- #7 BY .7 BY ,7SUB"#7$':7~#7'"
</pre>
<p>
INTERCAL also permits the redefining of array dimensioning, which is
done the same way as is the initial dimensioning.  All values of items
in an array are lost upon redimensioning, unless they have been
<code>STASH</code>ed (see <a href="s04.html#4.5">section 4.4.5</a>), in which
case restoring them also restores the old dimensions.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.2">4.4.2</a>  NEXT</h4>
<p>
The <code>NEXT</code> statement is used both for subroutine calls and
for unconditional transfers.  This statement takes the form:
<p>
<pre>
	DO (label) NEXT
</pre>
<p>
(or, of course,
<p>
<pre>
	PLEASE DO (label) NEXT
</pre>
<p>
etc.), where <var>(label)</var> represents any logical line label
which appears in the program.  The effect of such a statement is to
transfer control to the statement specified, and to store in a push
down list (which is initially empty) the location from which the
transfer takes place.  Items may be removed from this list and may be
discarded or used to return to the statement immediately following the
<code>NEXT</code> statement.  These operations are described in <a
href="s04.html#4.3">section 4.4.3</a> and <a href="s04.html#4.4">section 4.4.4</a>
respectively.  The programmer is generally advised to discard any
stack entries which he does not intend to utilize, since the stack has
a maximum depth of 79 entries.  A program's attempting to initiate an
80th level of <code>NEXT</code>ing will result in the fatal error
message, <samp>PROGRAM HAS DISAPPEARED INTO THE BLACK LAGOON</samp>.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.3">4.4.3</a>  FORGET</h4>
<p>
The statement <code>PLEASE FORGET </code><var>exp</var>, where
<var>exp</var> represents any expression (except colloquial and facial
expressions), causes the expression to be evaluated, and the specified
number of entries to be removed from the <code>NEXT</code>ing stack
and discarded.  An attempt to <code>FORGET</code> more levels of
<code>NEXT</code>ing than are currently stacked will cause the stack
to be emptied, and no error condition is indicated. This is because
the condition is not considered to be an error.  As described in
<a href="s04.html#4.2">section 4.4.2</a>, it is good programming practice to
execute a <code>DO FORGET #1</code> after using a <code>NEXT</code>
statement as an unconditional transfer, so that the stack does not get
cluttered up with unused entries:
<p>
<pre>
        DO (123) NEXT
        .
        .
  (123) DO FORGET #1
</pre>
<p>
<h4><a name="4.4">4.4.4</a>  RESUME</h4>
<p>
The statement <code>PLEASE RESUME </code><var>exp</var> has the same
effect as <code>FORGET</code>, except that program control is returned
to the statement immediately following the <code>NEXT</code> statement
which stored in the stack the last entry to be removed.  Note that a
rough equivalent of the FORTRAN computed <code>GO TO</code> and BASIC
<code>ON</code> <var>exp</var> <code>GO TO</code> is performed by a
sequence of the form:
<p>
<pre>
        DO (1) NEXT
        .
        .
    (1) DO (2) NEXT
        PLEASE FORGET #1
        .
        .
    (2) DO RESUME .1
</pre>
<p>
Unlike the <code>FORGET</code> statement, an attempt to
<code>RESUME</code> more levels of <code>NEXT</code>ing than has been
stacked will cause program termination.  See also
<a href="s04.html#4.11">section 4.4.11</a>.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.5">4.4.5</a>  STASH</h4>
<p>
Since subroutines are not explicitly implemented in INTERCAL, the
<code>NEXT</code> and <code>RESUME</code> statements must be used to
execute common routines.  However, as these routines might use the
same variables as the main program, it is necessary for them to save
the values of any variables whose values they alter, and later restore
them.  This process is simplified by the <code>STASH</code> statement,
which has the form <code>DO STASH </code><var>list</var>, where
<var>list</var> represents a string of one or more variable or array
names, separated by intersections (<code>+</code>).  Thus
<p>
<pre>
	PLEASE STASH .123+:123+,123
</pre>
<p>
stashes the values of two variables and one entire array.  The values
are left intact, and copies thereof are saved for later retrieval by
(what else?)  the <code>RETRIEVE</code> statement (see
<a href="s04.html#4.6">section 4.4.6</a>).  It is not possible to
<code>STASH</code> single array items.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.6">4.4.6</a>  RETRIEVE</h4>
<p>
<code>PLEASE RETRIEVE </code><var>list</var> restores the previously
<code>STASH</code>ed values of the variables and arrays named in the
<var>list</var>.  If a value has been stashed more than once, the most
recently <code>STASH</code>ed values are <code>RETRIEVE</code>d, and a
second <code>RETRIEVE</code> will restore the second most recent
values <code>STASH</code>ed.  Attempting to <code>RETRIEVE</code> a
value which has not been <code>STASH</code>ed will result in the error
message, <samp>THROW STICK BEFORE RETRIEVING</samp>.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.7">4.4.7</a>  IGNORE</h4>
<p>
The statement <code>DO IGNORE </code><var>list</var> causes all
subsequent statements to have no effect upon variables and/or arrays
named in <var>list</var>.  Thus, for example, after the sequence
<p>
<pre>
        DO .1 &lt;- #1
        PLEASE IGNORE .1
        DO .1 &lt;- #0
</pre>
<p>
16-bit variable number 1 would have the value 1, not 0.  Inputting and
retrieving (see <a href="s04.html#4.12">section 4.4.12</a> and
<a href="s04.html#4.6">section 4.4.6</a>) into an ignored variable also has no
effect on the variable, and the values that would have been input or
retrieved are discarded.  The condition is annulled via the
<code>REMEMBER</code> statement (see <a href="s04.html#4.8">section
4.4.8</a>).  Note that, when a variable is being <code>IGNORE</code>d,
its value, though immutable, is still available for use in expressions
and the like.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.8">4.4.8</a>  REMEMBER</h4>
<p>
<code>PLEASE REMEMBER </code><var>list</var> terminates the effect of
the <code>IGNORE</code> statement for all variables and/or arrays
named in the <var>list</var>.  It does not matter if a variable has
been <code>IGNORE</code>d more than once, nor is it an error if the
variable has not been <code>IGNORE</code>d at all.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.9">4.4.9</a>  ABSTAIN</h4>
<p>
INTERCAL contains no simple equivalent to an <code>IF</code> statement
or computed <code>GO TO</code>, making it difficult to combine similar
sections of code into a single routine which occasionally skips around
certain statements.  The <code>IGNORE</code> statement (see
<a href="s04.html#4.7">section 4.4.7</a>) is helpful in some cases, but a more
viable method is often required.  In keeping with the goal of INTERCAL
having nothing in common with any other language, this is made
possible via the <code>ABSTAIN</code> statement.
<p>
This statement takes on one of two forms.  It may not take on both at
any one time.  <code>DO ABSTAIN FROM </code><var>(label)</var> causes
the statement whose logical line label is <var>(label)</var> to be
abstained from.  <code>PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM </code><var>gerund
list</var> causes all statements of the specified type(s) to be
abstained from, as in
<p>
<pre>
        PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM STASHING
        PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM IGNORING + FORGETTING
        PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM NEXTING
        PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM CALCULATING
</pre>
<p>
Statements may also be automatically abstained from at the start of
execution via the <code>NOT</code> or <code>N'T</code> parameter (see
<a href="s04.html#3">section 4.3</a>).
<p>
If, in the course of execution, a statement is encountered which is
being abstained from, it is ignored and control passes to the next
statement in the program (unless it, too, is being abstained from).
<p>
The statement <code>DO ABSTAIN FROM ABSTAINING</code> is perfectly
valid, as is <code>DO ABSTAIN FROM REINSTATING</code> (although this
latter is not usually recommended).  However, the statement <code>DO
ABSTAIN FROM GIVING UP</code> is not accepted, even though <code>DON'T
GIVE UP</code> is.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.10">4.4.10</a>  REINSTATE</h4>
<p>
The <code>REINSTATE</code> statement, like <code>ABSTAIN</code>, takes
as an argument either a line label or a gerund list. No other form of
argument is permitted.  For example, the following is an invalid
argument:
<p>
<blockquote>
Given: x not equal to 0, y not equal to 0,  Prove: x + y = 0.
<br>
Since x does not equal 0, then x + 1 does not equal 1, x + a does not
equal a, x + y does not equal y.
<br>
But what is y? y is anything but 0.
<br>
Thus x + y is not equal to anything but 0.
<br>
Since x + y cannot equal anything but 0, x + y = 0.
</blockquote>
<p align="center">
Q.E.D.
<p>
<code>REINSTATE</code>ment nullifies the effects of an abstention.
Either form of <code>REINSTATE</code>ment can be used to "free" a
statement, regardless of whether the statement was abstained from by
gerund list, line label, or <code>NOT</code>.  Thus, <code>PLEASE
REINSTATE REINSTATING</code> is not necessarily an irrelevant
statement, since it might free a <code>DON'T REINSTATE</code> command
or a <code>REINSTATE</code> the line label of which was abstained
from.  However, <code>DO REINSTATE GIVING UP</code> is invalid, and
attempting to <code>REINSTATE</code> a <code>GIVE UP</code> statement
by line label will have no effect.  Note that this insures that
<code>DON'T GIVE UP</code> will always be a "do-nothing" statement.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.11">4.4.11</a>  GIVE UP</h4>
<p>
<code>PLEASE GIVE UP</code> is used to exit from a program.  It has
the effect of a <code>PLEASE RESUME #80</code>.  <code>DON'T GIVE
UP</code>, as noted in <a href="s04.html#4.10">section 4.4.10</a>, is
effectively a null statement.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.12">4.4.12</a>  Input</h4>
<p>
Input is accomplished with the statement <code>DO WRITE IN
</code><var>list</var>, where <var>list</var> represents a string of
variables and/or elements of arrays, separated by intersections.
Numbers are represented on cards, each number on a separate card, by
spelling out each digit (in English) and separating the digits with
one or more spaces.  Thus the range of (32-bit) input values
permissible extends from <samp>ZERO</samp> through <samp>FOUR TWO NINE
FOUR NINE SIX SEVEN TWO NINE FIVE</samp>.  A zero (0) may be spelled
as either <samp>ZERO</samp> or <samp>OH</samp>, and, for the
convenience of aviators, C-INTERCAL accepts the spelling
<samp>NINER</samp> for <samp>NINE</samp>.  In the service of
internationalization, C-INTERCAL also accepts input digits in
Sanskrit, Basque, Tagalog, Classical Nahuatl, Georgian, Kwakiutl, and
Volapuk.
<p>
Attempting to write in a value greater than or equal to <samp>SIX FIVE
FIVE THREE SIX</samp> for a 16-bit variable will result in the error
message, <samp>DON'T BYTE OFF MORE THAN YOU CAN CHEW</samp>.
<p>
The programmer desiring to handle input on a character basis should
consider using another language.  Failing that, refer to
<a href="s05.html">section 5</a>.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.13">4.4.13</a>  Output</h4>
<p>
Values may be output to the printer (or screen), one value per line,
via the statement <code>DO READ OUT </code><var>list</var>, where the
<var>list</var> contains variables, array elements, and/or constants.
Output is in the form of "extended" Roman numerals (also called
"butchered" Roman numerals), with an overline indicating the value
below is "times 1000", and lower-case letters indicating "times
1000000".  Zero is indicated by an overline with no character
underneath. Thus, the range of (32-bit) output values possible is from
<center>
<samp>
_<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</samp>
</center>
through
<center>
<samp>
__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;____________<br>
ivccxcivCMLXVIICCXCV
</samp>
</center>
Note: For values whose residues modulo 1000000 are less than 4000,
<center>
<samp>
&nbsp;<br>
M
</samp>
</center>
is used to represent 1000; for values whose residues are 4000 or
greater,
<center>
<samp>
_<br>
I
</samp>
</center>
is used. Thus <code>#3999</code> would read out as
<center>
<samp>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
MMMCMXCIX
</samp>
<a href="s04.html#fn3">*</a>
</center>
while <code>#4000</code> would read out as
<center>
<samp>
__<br>
IV
</samp>
</center>
Similar rules apply to the representation of values of the order of
1000000 and 1000000000.  The <code>READ OUT</code> statement can also
be used with arrays to produce other kinds of output; see
<a href="s05.html">section 5</a>.
<p>
<h4><a name="4.14">4.4.14</a>  COME FROM</h4>
<p>
The earliest known description of the <code>COME FROM</code> statement
in the computing literature is in R. L. Clark, <cite>"A linguistic
contribution to GOTO-less programming," Commun. ACM 27 (1984),
pp. 349-350</cite>, part of the famous April Fools issue of CACM.  The
subsequent rush by language designers to include the statement in
their languages was underwhelming, one might even say nonexistent.  It
was therefore decided that <code>COME FROM</code> would be an
appropriate addition to C-INTERCAL.
<p>
There are two useful ways to visualize the action of the <code>COME
FROM</code> statement.  The simpler is to see that it acts like a
<code>GOTO</code> when the program is traced backwards in time.  More
precisely, the statements
<p>
<pre>
(1)     DO &lt;any statement&gt;
        .
        .
        .
(2)     DO COME FROM (1)
</pre>
<p>
should be thought of as being equivalent to
<p>
<pre>
(1)     DO &lt;any statement&gt;
(2)     DO GOTO (3)
        .
        .
        .
(3)     DO NOTHING
</pre>
<p>
if INTERCAL actually had a <code>GOTO</code> statement at all, which
of course it doesn't.
<p>
What this boils down to is that the statement <code>DO COME FROM
</code><var>(label)</var>, anywhere in the program, places a kind of
invisible trap door immediately after statement <var>(label)</var>.
Execution or abstention of that statement is immediately followed by
an unconditional jump to the <code>COME FROM</code>, unless the
<var>(label)</var>ed statement is an executed <code>NEXT</code>, in
which case the jump occurs if the program attempts to
<code>RESUME</code> back to that <code>NEXT</code> statement.  It is
an error for more than one <code>COME FROM</code> to refer to the same
<var>(label)</var>.
<p>
Modification of the target statement by <code>ABSTAIN</code> or by the
<code>%</code> qualifier affects only that statement, not the
subsequent jump.  Such modifications to the <code>COME FROM</code>
itself, however, do affect the jump.  Encountering the <code>COME
FROM</code> statement itself, rather than its target, has no effect.
<p>
<h3><a name="5">4.5</a>  Comments</h3>
<p>
Unrecognizable statements, as noted in <a href="s09.html">section
9</a>, are flagged with a splat (<samp>*</samp>) during compilation,
and are not considered fatal errors unless they are encountered during
execution, at which time the statement (as input at compilation time)
is printed and execution is terminated.  This allows for an
interesting (and, by necessity, unique) means of including comments in
an INTERCAL listing.  For example, the statement:
<p>
<pre>
*       PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS LINE HAS NO EFFECT
</pre>
<p>
will be ignored during execution due to the inclusion of the
<code>NOT</code> qualifier.  User-supplied error messages are also
easy to implement:
<p>
<pre>
*       DO SOMETHING ABOUT OVERFLOW IN ;3
</pre>
<p>
as are certain simple conditional errors:
<p>
<pre>
* (123) DON'T YOU REALIZE THIS STATEMENT SHOULD ONLY BE ENCOUNTERED
                ONCE?
        PLEASE REINSTATE (123)
</pre>
<p>
This pair of statements will cause an error exit the second time they
are encountered.  Caution!  The appearance of a statement identifier
in an intended comment will be taken as the beginning of a new
statement.  Thus, the first example on the preceding page could not
have been:
<p>
<pre>
*       PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS LINE DOES NOTHING
</pre>
<p>
The third example, however, is valid, despite the appearance of two
cases of D-space-O, since INTERCAL does not ignore extraneous spaces
in statement identifiers.
<p>
(Note that the C-INTERCAL compiler does not produce a program listing
during compilation, this being a rather less necessary feature of a
compiler when text files are used in place of punch cards.  Thus,
the comments regarding splat-flagged lines do not apply to C-INTERCAL.)
<p>
<a name="fn3"><hr></a>
<font size=-1>
* The original INTERCAL-72 manual claimed that <code>#3999</code>
should render as <samp>MMMIM</samp>, but the C-INTERCAL developers
have been unable to find an algorithm that does this and is consistent
with the rest of the rules.
