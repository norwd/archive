Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to her to
have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.  "I
don't quite understand you," she said, as politely as she could.

<h2>9.  Error Messages</h2>
<p>
Due to INTERCAL's implementation of comment lines (see <a
href="s04.html#5">section 4.5</a>), most error messages are produced
during execution instead of during compilation.  All errors except
those not causing immediate termination of program execution are
treated as fatal.
<p>
<h3><a name="1">9.1</a>  Format</h3>
<p>
All error messages appear in the following form:
<p>
<pre>
        ICLnnnI (error message)
                ON THE WAY TO STATEMENT nnnn
                CORRECT SOURCE AND RESUBMIT
</pre>
<p>
The message varies depending upon the error involved.  For undecodable
statements the message is the statement itself.  The second line tells
which statement would have been executed next had the error not
occurred.  Note that if the error is due to 80 attempted levels of
<code>NEXT</code>ing, the statement which would have been executed
next need not be anywhere near the statement causing the error.
<p>
<h3><a name="2">9.2</a>  Messages</h3>
<p>
Brief descriptions of the different error types are listed below
according to message number.
<p>
<dl><samp>000</samp> An undecodable statement has been encountered in
the course of execution.  Note that keypunching errors can be slightly
disastrous, since if <code>FORGET</code> were misspelled F-O-R-G-E-R,
the results would probably not be those desired.  Extreme misspellings
may have even more surprising consequences.  For example, misspelling
<code>FORGET</code> R-E-S-U-M-E could have drastic results.
</dl>
<dl><samp>017</samp> An expression contains a syntax error.
</dl>
<dl><samp>079</samp> Improper use has been made of statement
identifiers.
</dl>
<dl><samp>099</samp> Improper use has been made of statement
identifiers.

</dl>
<dl><samp>241</samp> Invalid dimensioning information was supplied in
defining or using an array.

<dl><samp>633</samp> Execution has passed beyond the last statement of
the program.
