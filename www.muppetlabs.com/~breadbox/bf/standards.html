<h1>Portable Brainfuck</h1>
</center>
<p>
The detailed description of the language given in the page above is
only strictly accurate for the original Brainfuck compiler. Brainfuck
has many implementations, and some implementors have chosen to extend
the original M&uuml;ller limits, sometimes in ways that make it
difficult for a Brainfuck programmer to write portable code.
<p>
In the absence of a more formal regulating standards body, I offer up
my own guidelines to programmers desiring to create either portable
Brainfuck programs or compatible Brainfuck implementations. These
guidelines are based on my observations of the range of existing
Brainfuck implementations, and should include just about every sane
implementation created as of this writing.
<p>
For the reader who is unfamiliar with standard standardese, I offer
some prefatory definitions. When something is said to be
<def>implementation-defined</def>, such as an environmental limitation
or how a program construct behaves in a certain situation, that means
that a given implementation can do pretty much anything (subject to
any other applicable constraints, of course), but that the
implementation must document its choice. (In the case of Brainfuck,
however, many implementors consider the source code to be
documentation enough.) When something is said to be
<def>undefined</def>, however, that means that an implementation in
that situation can do pretty much anything at all without violating
any restrictions of this standard. (In other words, a portable
Brainfuck program should eschew all undefined behavior.)
<p>
Finally, note that comments in parentheses are informal; they are
offered merely as helpful clarifications, and do not impose any
requirements.

<h2>The Unofficial Constraints on Portable Brainfuck Implementations</h2>
</center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The actual size of the cell array is implementation-defined. However,
the array shall always contain at least 9999 cells. (Allowing the size
to be as small as a 4-digit number is done for the benefit of
programmers writing interpreters in three lines of C code and the
like.)
<li>
If a program attempts to move the pointer below the first array cell,
or beyond the last array cell, then that program's behavior is
undefined. (A few implementations cause the pointer to wrap around, but
many, perhaps most, implementations behave in a manner consistent with
a C pointer wandering off into arbitrary memory.)
<li>
The range of values a single cell can contain is
implementation-defined. (The range need not be consistent, either:
consider the case of a "bignum" implementation, whose cells' ranges
would be limited only by currently available resources.)  However, the
range of every cell shall always at least include the values 0 through
127, inclusive.
<li>
If a program attempts to either decrement the value of a cell below
its documented minimum value, if any, or increment the value of a cell
beyond its documented maximum value, if any, then the value in the
cell after such an operation is implementation-defined. (Most
implementations choose to let the value wrap around in a fashion
typical to C integers, but this is not required.)
<li>
If a program attempts to input a value when there is no more data in
the input stream, the value in the current cell after such an
operation is implementation-defined. (The most common choices are to
either store 0, or store -1, or to leave the cell's value unchanged.
This is frequently the most problematic issue for the programmer
wishing to achieve portability.)
<li>
If a program contains one or more unbalanced brackets, then the
behavior of that program is undefined. (In fact, a number of Brainfuck
compilers will crash during compilation itself.) (And no, I'm not
going to formally describe what "unbalanced" means here. You all know
what it means.)
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Since I am not an actual formal standards body, I don't have a nice
pronounceable acronym that one could prepend to "-compliant" to form
an adjective to describe a conforming implementation. In lieu of this,
then, I hereby suggest that a Brainfuck implementation that is
compliant with all of the constraints listed here should be described
as "nice".
