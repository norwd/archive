<h1>My Own Private Binary: Appendix</h1>

<h2>Making the Flat Binary Format Usable</h2>

<hr />

<p>Okay. At this point, we have a working kernel module that establishes
a new, metadata-free binary format for Linux. But without the tools
and libraries that we normally have at our disposal when writing
programs, trying to use this format is an utter pain. We're forced to
do everything from scratch, in bare assembly. How can we improve this
situation?</p>

<p>To be specific, there are two problems here:</p>

<ol>
<li>We can't create executables from regular object files, which
prevents us from using compiled languages like C.</li>
<li>We can't link with <code>libc</code>, so none of our familiar system functions
are accessible.</li>
</ol>

<p>In theory these problems are orthogonal to each other, but in practice
they become somewhat intertwined. But we need to start somewhere, so
let's begin with the first one.</p>

<h3>Creating Binaries</h3>

<p>The process of transforming an object file into an executable is
usually done by a linker, such as <code>ld(1)</code>. Now in this case "linker"
is something of a misnomer, since we're not even trying to link
anything. We just want to generate binary files that work with our
kernel module. If we could get that from a standard object file, then
at a stroke we would be able to use compilers again. The irony is that
a binary image is present inside of an object file &mdash; if only we could
remove all of the guff surrounding it.</p>

<p>And hey, we can do exactly that, thanks to <code>objcopy(1)</code>. This is a
utility program that few programmers ever need, but it's a nice little
program that's part of the standard GNU build tools. Its purpose is to
translate object files across different formats.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with the GNU BFD library? ("BFD" doesn't stand for
what you're probably thinking; it's short for "binary file
descriptor".) <code>libbfd</code> is a foundational hunk of code used in the GNU
toolchain. This library provides details about all the various binary
file formats &mdash; object files and executables alike. All of the GNU
build tools depend on <code>libbfd</code> for reading and writing these file
types, allowing them all to support binary file formats across a
variety of platforms.</p>

<p><code>objcopy</code> provides a simple command-line interface to a major piece of
functionality provided by <code>libbfd</code>. It allows you to pull apart an
object file, and then stuff those contents back into another object
file using a different format. And as it happens, <code>objcopy</code> provides a
null format called "binary" &mdash; a blank-slate format with no intrinsic
associated metadata. So, in theory, we should be able to ask <code>objcopy</code>
to extract the code section (which, according to tradition, is named
<code>.text</code>) from an ELF object file, and place it in a "binary" object
file, and that should give us a valid executable file that our kernel
module will load and run.</p>

<p>Before we can properly test this idea with an object file generated by
<code>gcc(1)</code>, though, we'd need to have the C code actually, you know, do
something. (If nothing else, it would need to exit safely.) Which
brings us face-to-face with the second problem. Set let's set
<code>objcopy</code> aside for a moment, and consider our lack of system library.</p>

<h3>Utility Functions</h3>

<p>It's rough for a C programmer to suddenly be denied access to the
standard functions. However, it is true that a number of the things
we're missing the most are provided by system calls, with the standard
library functions being little more than wrappers. So let's consider
those functions first.</p>

<p>We'll start with the <code>exit</code> system call, since it's quite simple and
used by nearly every program. We want to wrap a C function around it.
While we could use assembly language to write a function that can be
called from C, the number of instructions we need is small enough that
it makes more sense to use <code>gcc</code>'s inline assembly feature instead:</p>

<p><table class="source"><tr><td class="ul1"><td class="title" rowspan="2"><i>tiny.c</i><td><tr><td class="ul2"><td class="ur"><tr><td class="main" colspan="3"><pre><code>#define exit(exitcode)  asm volatile ("syscall" : : "a" (60), "D" (exitcode))
</code></pre></table></p>

<p>The inline assembly feature of <code>gcc</code> is notorious for being
complicated, but for our purposes it's absolutely worth it to
understand what it can do. In this example, we have on the left a
string that contains a single assembly-language instruction. But the
section on the right tells the compiler what you want the registers to
contain before it runs. In this case, we have a list of two registers,
with <code>"a"</code> indicating the register <code>rax</code> and <code>"D"</code> referring to <code>rdi</code>.
(There are varying levels of specificity available &mdash; for example,
<code>"r"</code> requests any general-purpose register, while <code>"U"</code> requests a
register that doesn't need to be preserved across function calls.) The
compiler will follow these requests and add instructions to initialize
<code>rax</code> and <code>rdi</code> with the given values right before the <code>syscall</code>
instruction.</p>

<p>We could have included instructions in our string to initialize <code>rax</code>
and <code>rdi</code> explicitly. But doing it this way allows the compiler, and
in particular the optimizer, to better merge our assembly with the
surrounding code. So, for example, knowing that the exit status has to
be stored in <code>rdi</code> may influence the compiler to use <code>rdi</code> to store it
there to begin with, thus allowing it to optimize away a <code>mov</code>
instruction. (Of course, once you invite the optimizer to your party,
you have to dance to its tune. This is one reason that the inline
assembly statement is marked as <code>volatile</code> &mdash; since our inline
assembly has no output values, the optimizer might incorrectly deduce
that our entire statement has no effect, and remove it entirely. The
<code>volatile</code> qualifier warns the compiler that the inline assembly has
side effects, and thus its usefulness cannot be judged on its outputs
alone.)</p>

<h3>Linking Without Linkers</h3>

<p>So, armed with this macro, let's return to our proposed <code>objcopy</code>
experiment. We'll make a C function that requires no assistance from
<code>libc</code>, or indeed any external entity:</p>

<p><table class="source"><tr><td class="ul1"><td class="title" rowspan="2"><i>tiny.c</i><td><tr><td class="ul2"><td class="ur"><tr><td class="main" colspan="3"><pre><code>#define exit(exitcode)  asm volatile ("syscall" : : "a" (60), "D" (exitcode))

void foo(void)
{
    exit(42);
}
</code></pre></table></p>

<p>The name of the function here isn't important, since we won't actually
be calling it as a function &mdash; it'll just run when the file is
executed. (It might have been more intuitive to call it <code>main()</code>, but
compilers give that name special treatment.) We'll compile it, and
then use <code>objcopy</code> to extract the object file's <code>.text</code> section.</p>

<p><div class="note">Note that the file sizes may not be the same on
your machine as on mine, depending on what compiler (and which
version) you use. The differences shouldn't be more than a few bytes
in either direction, however.</div>
<div class="term">$ <b>gcc -Wall -c tiny.c</b><br/>$ <b>objcopy -O binary -j .text tiny.o tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>wc -c tiny.com</b><br/>     21 tiny.com</div></p>

<p>While 21 bytes is quite a bit larger than our own 12-byte and 7-byte
creations, it's not bad for unoptimized compiler output. And it
suggests that <code>objcopy</code> did extract precisely what we wanted it to.
And when we test it:</p>

<p><div class="term">$ <b>chmod +x tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>./tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>echo $?</b><br/>42</div></p>

<p>We can see that we really do have a working binary, created using
standard build tools. Let's try it again, but this time inviting the
optimizer to get involved.</p>

<p><div class="note">The <code>-Os</code> option tells the compiler to optimize for
size instead of performance.</div>
<div class="term">$ <b>gcc -Wall -Os -c tiny.c</b><br/>$ <b>objcopy -O binary -j .text tiny.o tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>chmod +x tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>./tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>echo $?</b><br/>42<br/>$ <b>wc -c tiny.com</b><br/>     13 tiny.com</div></p>

<p>Down to 13 bytes &mdash; the C compiler is only one byte away from the
version that we created manually on our first try. That's quite
respectable! Let's look at the disassembly to see where the thirteenth
byte came from:</p>

<p><div class="term">$ <b>ndisasm -b64 tiny.com</b><br/>00000000  B83C000000        mov eax,0x3c<br/>00000005  BF2A000000        mov edi,0x2a<br/>0000000A  0F05              syscall<br/>0000000C  C3                ret</div></p>

<p>It's actually the exact same program that we wrote, the only
difference being a useless <code>ret</code> instruction tacked on at the end.
That's not surprising, in retrospect, as the compiler has no way of
knowing that the inline assembly will never finish. But guess what: we
can actually remedy that. <code>gcc</code> has a special pseudo-function named
<code>__builtin_unreachable()</code>. Using it in your code is a promise to the
compiler that control can never reach it. If we place a call to this
function at the end of <code>foo()</code>, the optimizer will take advantage of
our guarantee:</p>

<p><div class="term">$ <b>gcc -Wall -Os -c tiny.c</b><br/>$ <b>objcopy -O binary -j .text tiny.o tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>chmod +x tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>./tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>echo $?</b><br/>42<br/>$ <b>wc -c tiny.com</b><br/>     12 tiny.com<br/>$ <b>ndisasm -b64 tiny.com</b><br/>00000000  B83C000000        mov eax,0x3c<br/>00000005  BF2A000000        mov edi,0x2a<br/>0000000A  0F05              syscall</div></p>

<p>Writing our programs in C is now looking rather attractive, when the
compiler can do such a good job at whittling away extra instructions.</p>

<p>However, this <code>objcopy</code> technique is not going to scale up. Not only
is it a terrible hack, it's also dependent on there being only one
function in our program. If the code contained multiple functions, we
couldn't guarantee that our top-level function would be placed first
in the <code>.text</code> section. Moreover, if our code makes use of any global
variables, the compiler will almost certainly place them in a separate
<code>.data</code> section, making their addresses incompatible with addresses in
the <code>.text</code> section.</p>

<p>It might seem that we've landed back to square one, with no easy way
to extract usable binaries out of the compiler's object files. But not
so &mdash; we're just getting started here. Using <code>objcopy</code> allowed us to
avoid the linker entirely, but the truth is that we still want the
linker's help with things like address fixups. Fortunately for us, the
linker is remarkably amenable to this kind of detailed customization,
thanks to the existence of linker scripts.</p>

<h3>Linker Scripts</h3>

<p>If you are not already familiar with linker scripts, you may be
surprised to learn that a significant block of a linker's logic
resides not in the code itself, or even in a library like <code>libbfd</code>,
but rather in simple, textual configuration files. Every time you run
your linker, it uses the appropriate linker script as a guide for what
to put where. While linker scripts are mostly stored internally, you
can typically also find copies of them under the linker's search
paths. On my machine, they are under
<code>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ldscripts/</code>. Linker scripts can and do get
extremely complicated, but for basic needs like our own they can be
quite simple:</p>

<p><table class="source"><tr><td class="ul1"><td class="title" rowspan="2"><i>comfile.x</i><td><tr><td class="ul2"><td class="ur"><tr><td class="main" colspan="3"><pre><code>/* Linker script for command executable files */
OUTPUT_FORMAT(binary)
OUTPUT(a.com)
SECTIONS
{
  .main 0x10000 : { *(.main) }
  .text : { *(.text) *(.rodata) }
  .data : { *(.data) *(.bss) }
  /DISCARD/ : { *(.eh_frame) }
}
</code></pre></table></p>

<p>The first line sets the "binary" format as the BFD-provided file
format to output. Using this null format ensures that the resulting
file will contain only what our linker script explicitly asks for. The
second line provides a default filename if none is provided on the
command line.</p>

<p>The <code>SECTIONS</code> block lays out what the output file should contain,
like a blueprint. This script specifies that the linker should place
all of the <code>.text</code> and <code>.rodata</code> sections together before any <code>.data</code>
and <code>.bss</code> sections, for example. (The asterisks before the names are
there because there can be more than one section with the same name
when multiple object files are involved &mdash; i.e. the situation in which
there is actual linking being done.) Other sections not named in the
blueprint do not make it into the output file, for the most part. Some
sections, like <code>.eh_frame</code>, are still included in the BFD-defined
binary format, but fortunately the linker provides an explicit
<code>/DISCARD/</code> destination that causes sections to be forcibly omitted.</p>

<p>But then what's this <code>.main</code> section at the top, with the hexadecimal
annotation? This is how we can choose which function will land at the
start of the generated binary. We will define a separate section that
is specifically set aside for our top-level function. The linker can
then ensure that that function is placed in front of everything else.
(The <code>0x10000</code> annotation is the value of <code>loadaddr</code> in our kernel
module. It informs the linker where the binary will be loaded into
memory, so that the linker can calculate absolute addresses if called
upon to do so.)</p>

<p><code>gcc</code>, like most compilers, provides an extension that allows us to
mark objects for placement in non-standard sections. We can use this
in our C program like so:</p>

<p><table class="source"><tr><td class="ul1"><td class="title" rowspan="2"><i>tiny.c</i><td><tr><td class="ul2"><td class="ur"><tr><td class="main" colspan="3"><pre><code>static void exit(int exitcode)
{
    asm ("syscall" : : "a" (60), "D" (exitcode));
    __builtin_unreachable();
}

void __attribute__((section(".main"))) _main(void)
{
    exit(42);
}
</code></pre></table></p>

<p>After compiling, we can use <code>objdump(1)</code> to look at the list of
sections created by the compiler:</p>

<p><div class="term">$ <b>gcc -Wall -c tiny.c</b><br/>$ <b>objdump -h tiny.o</b><br/><br/>tiny.o:     file format elf64-x86-64<br/><br/>Sections:<br/>Idx Name          Size      VMA               LMA               File off  Algn<br/>  0 .text         00000013  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00000040  2**0<br/>                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE<br/>  1 .data         00000000  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00000053  2**0<br/>                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA<br/>  2 .bss          00000000  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00000053  2**0<br/>                  ALLOC<br/>  3 .main         00000011  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00000053  2**0<br/>                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, RELOC, READONLY, CODE<br/>  4 .comment      0000002a  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00000064  2**0<br/>                  CONTENTS, READONLY<br/>  5 .note.GNU-stack 00000000  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  0000008e  2**0<br/>                  CONTENTS, READONLY<br/>  6 .eh_frame     00000058  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00000090  2**3<br/>                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, RELOC, READONLY, DATA</div></p>

<p>As you can see, there are a fair number of sections, though several
are actually empty. But the important point is that there is both a
<code>.text</code> section and a <code>.main</code> section, and both of them are non-empty.
This shows that our two functions did in fact wind up in separate
sections. The <code>.text</code> section appears earlier in the object file, but
our linker script will ensure that the contents of <code>.main</code> are placed
first.</p>

<p>Typically the linker will determine which kind of output file it's
being asked to create from context, and then load the appropriate
linker script from its own store. We can explicitly tell the linker to
use our hand-rolled script instead, via the <code>-T</code> command-line option:</p>

<p><div class="term">$ <b>gcc -Wall -c tiny.c</b><br/>$ <b>ld -T ./comlink.x -o tiny.com tiny.o</b><br/>$ <b>./tiny.com</b><br/>$ <b>echo $?</b><br/>42<br/>$ <b>wc -c tiny.com</b><br/>     36 tiny.com</div></p>

<p>The binary's increased size is mainly due to <code>exit()</code> being written as
a separate function. If we turn optimization back on, the optimizer
will see that the <code>exit()</code> function can be inlined instead, and we
will quickly get our 12-byte executable again.</p>

<h3>More Inline Assembly</h3>

<p>Now that we can safely write code with multiple functions, we can
create proper wrapper functions for system calls. We've got a working
<code>exit()</code> function; now let's see what a wrapper function for <code>write()</code>
might look like:</p>

<p><table class="source"><tr><td class="ul1"><td class="title" rowspan="2"><i>write.c</i><td><tr><td class="ul2"><td class="ur"><tr><td class="main" colspan="3"><pre><code>long write(int fd, void const *buf, long size)
{
    long r;

    asm volatile ("syscall" : "=a" (r)
			    : "0" (1), "D" (fd), "S" (buf), "d" (size)
			    : "rcx", "r11", "memory");

    if (r &lt; 0) {
        errno = -r;
        r = -1;
    }
    return r;
}
</code></pre></table></p>

<p>This one is a bit more involved. That's partly because <code>write()</code> takes
more arguments, but it's mainly because unlike <code>exit()</code> it actually
returns. The part after the first colon declares the assembly's
outputs &mdash; i.e. the values that need to be transferred into C
variables afterwards. As with all system calls, <code>write</code>'s return value
is stored in <code>rax</code>, which is indicated by the constraint string
<code>"=a"</code>. Now <code>rax</code> also appears in the second list, the list of inputs,
but this time the constraint string is <code>"0"</code> instead of <code>"a"</code>. This is
because registers cannot be repeated across constraint strings: if a
register is both an output and an input, the latter needs to be
referred to by its (zero-based) index instead.</p>

<p>The final clause in the <code>asm</code> statement is a list of operands that are
neither inputs nor outputs but are nonetheless modified by the inline
assembly. The optimizer will assume that any register not mentioned
will be diligently preserved, so it's important to be thorough here.
As it happens, Linux system calls are documented as preserving all
registers except <code>rcx</code> and <code>r11</code> (and <code>rax</code>, obviously), so our list
is mercifully short. The last item, <code>"memory"</code> is a general indicator
that the inline assembly reads and/or writes memory locations other
than the explicitly named C variables. (If we didn't include this
constraint, the optimizer might feel justified in reordering
statements so that, for example, the <code>write</code> system call is made
before the code that actually populates the buffer contents.)</p>

<p>Finally, our function checks for a negative return, and stores such
values in a global <code>errno</code> variable, so that it matches the behavior
of the standard library function.</p>

<p>Let's put all this together into a self-contained hello-world C
program:</p>

<p><table class="source"><tr><td class="ul1"><td class="title" rowspan="2"><i>hello.c</i><td><tr><td class="ul2"><td class="ur"><tr><td class="main" colspan="3"><pre><code>static int errno = 0;

static long write(int fd, void const *buf, long size)
{
    long r;
    asm volatile ("syscall" : "=a" (r)
			    : "0" (1), "D" (fd), "S" (buf), "d" (size)
			    : "rcx", "r11", "memory");
    if (r &lt; 0) {
        errno = -r;
        r = -1;
    }
    return r;
}

static __attribute__((noreturn)) void exit(int exitcode)
{
    asm volatile ("syscall" : : "a" (60), "D" (exitcode));
    __builtin_unreachable();
}

void __attribute__((section(".main"))) _main(void)
{
    write(1, "hello, world\n", 13);
    exit(errno ? 1 : 0);
}
</code></pre></table></p>

<p>And test it:</p>

<p><div class="term">$ <b>gcc -Wall -Os -c hello.c</b><br/>$ <b>ld -T comfile.x -o hello.com hello.o</b><br/>$ <b>./hello.com</b><br/>hello, world<br/>$ <b>./hello.com >/dev/null ; echo $?</b><br/>0<br/>$ <b>./hello.com >/dev/full ; echo $?</b><br/>1<br/>$ <b>wc -c hello.com</b><br/>     72 hello.com</div></p>

<p>With the extra error-handling, our file size has ballooned to a
whopping 72 bytes &mdash; but the fact that the C compiler generated it all
for us is a breath of fresh air.</p>

<h3>Arguing About Arguments</h3>

<p>If we want to move on to a program that actually does something
useful, however, we are once again faced with the issue of accessing
<code>argc</code>, <code>argv</code>, and <code>envp</code>. Ideally we would like to access those
values as parameters to our top-level function, just as we normally do
with <code>main()</code>. But right now those values are stored on the stack, and
under the x86 64-bit calling convention, function arguments are passed
through registers instead. How can we fix this?</p>

<p>One way would be to add some inline assembly at the beginning of our
top-level function to grab these three values from the stack and cram
them into variables. This is not a great solution, because functions
usually set up a stack frame first thing, the size of which varies. So
it would be preferable to address the issue before the function runs,
instead of during.</p>

<p>Another possible approach would be to work the opposite end, and
modify our kernel module so that it stores those three values in
registers in the first place. Is that even possible? It actually is.
You may remember that the final step in our kernel module's loader
function is calling <code>start_thread()</code>, and that the first argument to
that function is a pointer to a struct holding the process's register
contents. Nothing is stopping us from modifying those values before
passing them along to <code>start_thread()</code>. In fact, it's actually
considered good policy to do just that, and set all of the
general-purpose registers to known values (zero if nothing else).
Otherwise, the registers will contain whatever values were left in
them from the parent process, and this could, at least in theory, leak
information and become a security issue. Okay, so why haven't we done
that already? Well, the issue is that registers are
architecture-specific, and so naturally the struct storing their
values is too. The kernel source tree is set up so that most of the
code is architecture-neutral, with the minimal amount of necessary
architecture-specific code being relegated to separate directory
subtrees. Right now, our kernel module is architecture-neutral, so it
would be preferable not to embed x86-specific code in the middle of
it.</p>

<p>(Of course, if I thought there was a snowball's chance in hell that
this code could ever become an official kernel module, I would happily
break out the architecture-specific code into separate files and
integrate them into the full directory structure, not to mention doing
the necessary research to determine the proper calling convention for
the Tensilica Xtensa architecture and all the other less-popular
platforms that Linux runs on. But you and I both know that this flat
binary file format is never going to be officially adopted, so I'd
prefer to find a solution that doesn't involve the kernel module
code.) <div class="note">(Side note to the side note: On the off chance that you wound
up on this page because you were searching for "Tensilica Xtensa
calling convention", the basic convention is that the first six
arguments are stored in registers <code>a2</code> through <code>a7</code>, in order, with
further arguments stored on the stack. However, the register window
can shift these forward depending on the call instruction, so I
recommend you read <a href="http://wiki.linux-xtensa.org/index.php/ABI_Interface">this reference
page</a> to get
further details.)</div>
</p>

<p>A third possibility would be to provide a tiny bit of prolog code, to
be inserted at the top of the binary, that pops the stack values into
registers. This is more or less what the implicit object file <code>crt1.o</code>
does for normal C programs, via the <code>_start()</code> function that in turn
calls <code>main()</code>. In fact, it's such a common thing to need that the
linker script has a feature supporting it. The <code>STARTUP()</code> command can
be used at the top level to implicitly include an object file <em>and</em>
ensure that it will be linked first, before the other input files. The
nice thing about this approach is that if we did want to add support
for another architecture, we would just need to provide a different
startup object file.</p>

<p>For the x86 64-bit architecture, the calling convention is that the
first six function arguments are stored in <code>rdi</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rcx</code>,
<code>r8</code>, and <code>r9</code>, with further arguments stored on the stack. (Note that
this isn't the whole story: SSE registers are used for floating-point
arguments, for example. But these details are sufficient for our
purposes.) So, converting our three stack entries to function
parameters simply requires the following:</p>

<p><table class="source"><tr><td class="ul1"><td class="title" rowspan="2"><i>startup.asm</i><td><tr><td class="ul2"><td class="ur"><tr><td class="main" colspan="3"><pre><code>BITS 64
SECTION .main	
	pop	rdi
	pop	rsi
	pop	rdx
</code></pre></table></p>

<p>This reduces down to a measly three bytes of machine code, but we need
to house it in an ELF object file so that the linker can use it at
link time:</p>

<p><table class="source"><tr><td class="ul1"><td class="title" rowspan="2"><i>comfile.x</i><td><tr><td class="ul2"><td class="ur"><tr><td class="main" colspan="3"><pre><code><span class="dim">/* Linker script for command executable files */</span>
<span class="dim">OUTPUT_FORMAT(binary)</span>
<span class="dim">OUTPUT(a.com)</span>
STARTUP(startup.o)
<span class="dim">SECTIONS</span>
<span class="dim">{</span>
<span class="dim">  .main 0x10000 : { *(.main) }</span>
<span class="dim">  .text : { *(.text) *(.rodata) }</span>
<span class="dim">  .data : { *(.data) *(.bss) }</span>
<span class="dim">  /DISCARD/ : { *(.eh_frame) }</span>
<span class="dim">}</span>
</code></pre></table></p>

<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>

<p>In order to verify that this change really does give us working
function arguments, we'll write a quick-and-dirty test program:</p>

<p><table class="source"><tr><td class="ul1"><td class="title" rowspan="2"><i>test.c</i><td><tr><td class="ul2"><td class="ur"><tr><td class="main" colspan="3"><pre><code>static void println(char *str)
{
    int n, r;

    for (n = 0 ; str[n] ; ++n) ;
    str[n] = '\n';
    asm volatile ("syscall" : "=a" (r)
			    : "0" (1), "D" (1), "S" (str), "d" (n + 1)
                            : "rcx", "r11", "memory");
}

static void exit(int exitcode)
{
    asm volatile ("syscall" : : "a" (60), "D" (exitcode));
    __builtin_unreachable();
}

void __attribute__((section(".main"))) _main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])
{
    int i;

    for (i = 0 ; i &lt; argc ; ++i)
        println(argv[i]);
    for (i = 0 ; envp[i] ; ++i)
        println(envp[i]);
    exit(0);
}
</code></pre></table></p>

<p>When we build everything, we get:</p>

<p><div class="term">$ <b>nasm -f elf64 startup.asm</b><br/>$ <b>gcc -Wall -Os -c test.c</b><br/>$ <b>ld -T comfile.x -o test.com test.o</b><br/>$ <b>./test.com foo bar baz | head</b><br/>./test.com<br/>foo<br/>bar<br/>baz<br/>_=./test.com<br/>SHLVL=1<br/>HOME=/home/breadbox<br/>USERNAME=breadbox<br/>HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth<br/>XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/breadbox/.config<br/>$ <b>wc -c test.com</b><br/>    103 test.com</div></p>

<p>And with that, we now have a working system for writing (almost)
idiomatic C code, with the output being a binary file format of our
own design.</p>

<p>Of course, this is still little more than a proof of concept. The next
step would be to create a larger library of wrapper functions around
the system calls, as well as providing popular standard function like
<code>strlen()</code>. (We should also define a nice macro to hide the messiness
of the <code>_main()</code> function declaration.) A dozen or so functions is
enough to be able to start writing some non-trivial programs.</p>

<p>In fact, I did enough of this to be able to build my own replacement
version of <code>factor(1)</code>. A standalone binary with all the same features
as the standard utility, it manages to squeeze in at just under 1k in
size &mdash; whereas the <code>/usr/bin/factor</code> on my machine is dependent on
<code>libc</code> and is still over 74k. What a grotesque cyclopean boat anchor
of a binary, am I right? (Of course, the standard utility includes a
bunch of complicated math functions that allow it to complete quickly
even when given very large numbers, but you don't really notice the
difference in speed until you reach the trillions. Hey, there are
always tradeoffs.)</p>

<p>That said, my version is a standalone executable out of necessity. If
it could have linked with a shared system library, like <code>libc</code>, it
might have been smaller still. But our binary file format has no
support for dynamic linking. Nor is it likely to in the future, as
that would require the ability to look up functions by name, and to
identify addresses needing fixups at runtime. All of which calls for
&hellip; metadata. So, static libraries for us it is. If you'd like to see
and/or build any of this code yourself, by the way, I've provided a
tarball with all of the source code.</p>

<p>It would be awfully nice, though, if we had to option to statically
link with <code>libc</code> itself. In theory this ought to be possible, since
our private binary file format doesn't really require any special
handling of code before the linking stage, and building a static
library doesn't involve the linker. Unfortunately, however, <code>libc</code> is
a bit of a special case, as the library depends on special features of
ELF executables (such as defining initialization functions that run in
advance of <code>main()</code>). So even though I was able to get my programs to
statically link with <code>libc.a</code>, they invariably crashed on startup.
It's possible that someone else's nonstandard, less-featureful
implementation of the C library would work for our programs, but so
far I haven't found a decent solution. I'll keep looking, though. This
binary file format may never be installed on any Linux machine besides
my own, but I'm fond of it nonetheless.</p>
