<h2>A "Translation" of a Monovocalic Sonnet in Italian by Giuseppe Varaldo</h2>

<p>
To read the original Italian monovocalic sonnet, consult Giuseppe
Varaldo's "All'alba Shahrazad andr&agrave; ammazzata", or see chapter
five of Douglas Hofstadter's "Le Ton Beau de Marot".

Virgil finds Pilgrim, drifting in midnight,
<br>
Bids Pilgrim visit sin's finishing pit:
<br>
Insists glimpsing spirits sinking in shit,
<br>
Sizzling in pitch, will gift him with insight.
<p>
Circling in with diminishing windings,
<br>
Visiting kith, slinging witticisms,
<br>
Indicting kings with biting criticisms,
<br>
Inscribing in ringing tristichs his findings.
<p>
Drinking in sights, drinking his fill,
<br>
Skirting grim imps with childish tricks,
<br>
Sighing, "'Tis right: it is His will."
<p>
Pilgrim clings tight whilst Virgil climbs Nick's
<br>
bristling thigh: flipping, climbs still ...
<br>
'Till sighting night's shining, inspiring pinpricks.

Alternate, "Bowdlerized" version of the first stanza:
<p>
Virgil finds Pilgrim, drifting in midnight,
<br>
Bids Pilgrim visit sin's finishing ditch:
<br>
Insists glimpsing spirits sizzling in pitch,
<br>
Sinking in filth, will gift him with insight.
