<h1>Explaining The Monty Hall Problem</h1>
<hr/>
<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>
Imagine yourself on Let's Make a Deal. Monty Hall has you onstage, and
shows you the proverbial three doors. Behind one of them is a new car,
and behind the other two are goats. He asks you to pick a door to
open. You do so. Monty Hall then opens one of the doors you didn't
pick to show you that that door concealed a goat. Of course he can
always show you a goat, regardless of what's behind your door. (Assume
for now that when Monty has a choice of doors to open, he picks one at
random.) There are now only two doors left, one of them being the one
you picked. Monty Hall then asks you if you would like to stick with
your original choice, or switch to the remaining door.
<p>
The question is this: Does it matter if you switch or not? And if it
does, should you switch?
<p>
(If by chance you don't already know this puzzle, then I strongly
encourage you to take a moment and figure out the answer for
yourself.)
<p>
The intuitive response is: No, of course it doesn't matter if you
switch. There are two doors, so the odds must be an even fifty-fifty.
The fact that there used to be three doors doesn't matter at this
point. It's like flipping a coin and having it come up heads nine
times in a row: What are the odds that the next flip will come up
heads? The answer is one in two, because the past events don't
influence the present state.
<p>
However, this situation happens to be a little different. The correct
answer is that it does make a difference, and that you should adopt a
policy of switching. If you switch doors, the odds of getting the new
car are two in three.
<p>
If upon reading the above paragraph, your reaction is to strongly
doubt its veracity (and perhaps even my intelligence), then let me
tell you right now you are in excellent company. You're joined not
just by the majority of people with average levels of math education
&mdash; professional mathematicians are just as likely to have that
reaction. Quite a number of them have embarrassed themselves publicly
by insisting that that fifty-fifty answer has to be correct.
<p>
What follows is a collection of seven different ways to explain why
this counter-intuitive fact is true. These explanations effectively
all say the same thing, but from different points of view. Most of
them will probably sound unconvincing at first. Our intuition is so
sure of itself, it can be hard to get it to budge. In my experience,
when people guess the wrong answer, they will continue to remain
unmoved by explanations for a while. Eventually they reach a tipping
point, and can start to get a handle on where their intuition has gone
astray. My guess is that explanations don't help until after that
point has been reached. Which may be why it's always a different
explanation that finally convinces. Whatever the reason, I recommend
that you try on all of the following explanations, in any order you
like, until you find one that feels like it works for you.
<p>
(Then, for extra credit, once you feel you've completely aceepted the
explanation, go back and reread the ones that didn't convince you, and
try to figure out why.)
<p>
<h3>I. The <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i> Explanation</h3>
<p>
At the very beginning, when you make your first selection, you have a
one in three chance of getting the car. We think that when Monty Hall
opens another door, the odds should go up to one in two, but remember
that Monty can <em>always</em> open a door. So imagine that you're
still trying to make your first choice. You think to yourself: "Door
#1 has a one in three chance of being correct. However, after I
announce that choice, Monty Hall will expose a goat behind one of the
other doors, and at that point the odds of Door #1 being correct will
shoot up to one in two. However, it now occurs to me that I don't have
to wait for him to do this, because I already know for a fact that he
will do this. It is already certain knowledge. So the odds of Door #1
being right are already one in two." But you can apply the same
reasoning to Door #2 and Door #3, and get the same result. This will
leave you with a total of 150% for all three possibilities, and this
is obviously wrong. Therefore our assumption that Monty Hall showing
us a goat will change the odds must be wrong. Which means that the
door we select must still have a one in three chance of being the
winning door. Since there is only one other door remaining, the
probability of it hiding the car must be two in three.
<p>
<h3>II. The Forced Hand Explanation</h3>
<p>
At the beginning, when you pick a door for the first time, you have a
one-in-three chance of picking the car, and a two-in-three chance of
picking a goat. What happens next? Assume for the moment that you've
picked the car. Monty Hall therefore can choose either of the two
remaining doors to open, since they both conceal goats, and when you
switch, you are guaranteed to wind up with the other goat. Now instead
assume that you've picked one of the goats to begin with. Monty
doesn't have a choice of doors now; he must expose the remaining goat.
So when you switch, you are guaranteed to wind up with the car. It's
the only thing left. Since you have a two-thirds chance of picking a
goat at the beginning, always switching gives you the car two-thirds
of the time at the end.
<p>
<h3>III. The N Doors Explanation</h3>
<p>
Imagine that instead of three, there are a hundred doors &mdash; one
car and 99 goats. Let's say that you pick Door #34. Monty Hall then
opens a different door to expose a goat, and then offers you the
choice to keep your choice, or switch to one of the remaining 98
doors. Let's assume that you choose to stick with Door #34. He then
exposes another goat, and then another, and another, and so on, each
time offering you the chance to switch, and every time you turn him
down. Finally, he opens a 98th door, showing you a 98th goat. The only
doors still closed are Door #34, the door you picked, and Door #78.
For the last time, Monty gives you the option of switching. If you
take a moment to think about it, you'll realize that you'd be a fool
not to switch at this point. Odds are 99% that you started by picking
a goat, and thus you have forced Monty to expose all the remaining
goats in order to keep the car concealed. The odds that the car
is <em>not</em> behind Door #78 is therefore 1%. Right? So at that
point you switch. But now imagine the same scenario with only ten
doors. After Monty Hall opens eight door and exposed eight goats, then
principle is less pointed but otherwise the same. The odds are nine in
ten in your favor if you switch. Now consider the case with only five
doors ... four doors ... then three doors. The principle continues to
hold: your odds are always increased by switching.
<p>
<h3>IV. The Equivalent Situation Explanation</h3>
<p>
Imagine instead that first you make your pick of Door #1, and then,
without opening any doors, Monty Hall asks you if you wish to stick
with your original choice, or switch to Door #2 <em>and</em> Door #3.
That is, if you switch, you get the car if it's behind either of the
other two doors. It's pretty obvious in this case that switching
doubles your chances. But this is actually identical to the original
problem. The opening of one of the doors you didn't pick can be seen
as effectively "giving" you that door.
<p>
<h3>V. The Table-Turning Explanation</h3>
<p>
The key point to realize is that when you switch, you will always
switch to the opposite of what you originally picked. You can't switch
from a goat to a goat, because Monty Hall always removes one of the
two goats from consideration before you switch. (And of course you
can't switch from a car to a car, because there's only one car all
along.) No matter what happens beforehand, at the time of your switch
there is one goat and one car. So, if you start with the car,
switching moves you to the goat, and if you start with a goat, you
will switch to the car. Switching therefore reverses the odds of the
original game, putting them in your favor. Because you have a
two-in-three chance of starting with a goat, you have a two-in-three
chance of ending with the car.
<p>
<h3>VI. The Probability Table Explanation</h3>
<p>
Our confusion comes from how we think the probability breaks down. We
tend to imagine the situtation as being something like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
Assume for the sake of concreteness that you start by picking Door #1,
and Monty Hall chooses Door #3 to open and expose a goat. The possible
outcomes from that point are:
<p>
<table class="ptable">
<tr><td>#1<td>#2<td>#3</tr>
<tr><td>car<td>goat<td>goat<td>&mdash; you will win if you don't switch</tr>
<tr><td>goat<td>car<td>goat<td>&mdash; you will win if you do switch</tr>
<tr><td>goat<td>goat<td>car<td>&mdash; impossible, since Monty will
  never expose the car</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
This line of reasoning makes it look like there are only two possible
situations, equally likely, and thus there is a fifty-fifty chance of
winning. But this is faulty, because it fails to take into account
that the door you start with affects the probabilities of what happens
next. Your initial choice affects which door Monty Hall can choose. In
fact, Monty doesn't even have a choice most of the time, and the
probability table up above fails to take that imbalance into account.
So instead, we must go back to the point at which you first selected
Door #1, and break down the possible scenarios from there:
<p>
<table class="ptable">
<tr><td>#1<td>#2<td>#3</tr>
<tr><td>car<td>goat<td>goat<td>&mdash; Monty can open #2 or #3,
  and (either way) you will lose if you switch</tr>
<tr><td>goat<td>car<td>goat<td>&mdash; Monty must open #3,
  and you will win if you switch</tr>
<tr><td>goat<td>goat<td>car<td>&mdash; Monty must open #2,
  and you will win if you switch</tr>
</table>
<p>
Thus we see that a policy of switching gives us the car two times out
of three.
<p>
<h3>VII. The Soul of Wit Explanation</h3>
<p>
The truth is that the door that Monty Hall chooses to open doesn't
tell you anything about the door you originally selected &mdash; but
it does tell you something about the door he <em>didn't</em> open.
<em>couldn't</em> open.
