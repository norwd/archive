<h1>Making a Unique Keyboard</h1>
<p>
One day, my daughter started telling us stories about a race of
triangular beings. The fact that these stories started a short time
after she discovered the videos of Vi Hart
(<a href="http://vihart.com/videos/">link</a>) is, I'm sure,
completely coincidental.
</p>
</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>
According to my daughter, the Triangles have their own world, their
own history, and their own alphabet. Conveniently, their alphabet has
26 letters that correspond to the Roman alphabet. Upon my request, she
wrote out the full alphabet for me to learn, which was useful for
reading the speech balloons in her doodles of Triangles.
</p>
<p>
One day, I was looking at a speech balloon that said "YAY!" and it
struck me that the Triangles even had their own exclamation point.
Curious, I asked her about the Triangle period, comma, and so forth,
and to my surprise she readily produced (on a page in my notebook)
every single punctuation mark I could think to ask about. Question
mark, percent sign, asterisk, curly braces &hellip; the Triangles even
had their own symbol for our dollar sign and cent sign. The Triangles
used the same numerical digits as we did, but everything else was
different.
</p>
<p>
(And these symbols weren't just being tossed off on a whim, either. At
one point I went back through some of her old doodles made during math
homework, and realized that she had shown me the Triangle plus sign
and equal sign several months ago. They were the same as the ones she
had drawn recently.)
</p>
<p>
Looking at this page of symbols, I got it in my head that it would be
fun to draw up an ASCII chart for her, but written entirely in the
Triangle's alphabet. I seriously considered making this for her as a
Christmas present, when an even better idea occurred to me.
</p>
<p>
An actual keyboard, entirely in Triangle.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/idea.jpg" width="240" height="240"/>
</div>
<p>
At first, I figured this wouldn't actually be too hard to do. All I
needed was a keyboard with blank keycaps, and some way to draw symbols
on them. And it is exactly this sort of blind na&iuml;vet&eacute; that
marks the initiation of many of my most successful projects, because
if I had understood at the outset how much work this would actually
entail, I almost certainly would have been too intimidated to proceed.
</p>
<p>
The first order of business was to procure the blank keyboard, and
fortunately for me such things do already exist. The DAS keyboard
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B003F7WXTG">amazon link</a>) is
a well-known though expensive instance of one. I did a little poking
around a found a more reasonably-priced example from a company called
Ablenet (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B013IIRBK2">amazon
link</a>).
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/blankkeys.jpg" width="480" height="288"/>
</div>
<p>
It comes with large-font stickers that you can apply to the keys. Or
not, as the case may be.
</p>
<p>
After plugging it into my computer and verifying that that all the
keys were where I thought they were, I drew up a chart showing the
full layout of all 104 keys, and their Triangle legends.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/keychart.jpg" width="640" height="480"/>
</div>
<p>
Making this chart also alerted me to the fact that there were no less
than three symbols on the keyboard that I had yet to obtain &mdash;
the ampersand, the caret and the tilde. At my next opportunity, I
contrived a plausible reason for asking her about these. For the
ampersand she immediately rendered the glyph. But to my dismay, for
the other two she said she simply didn't know what they were, yet. I
offered to help, explaining how the symbols were used in writing and
in mathematics, and even pointing out that the caret was almost a
triangle, but none of this had any effect. When I then suggested,
"Maybe their caret and tilde looks just like ours?" she merely
shrugged and replied, "Sure, for now." Hmmm.
</p>
<p>
(In this photo you can also see some of the designs I played around
with to replace the MS Windows-logo key, so as to make it more
triangular.)
</p>
<p>
Along with the keyboard, I purchased a set of transparent keycap
stickers. I thought this might be an easy way to add symbols to a
blank keyboard. Even better if I could draw on the underside &mdash;
the sticky side &mdash; and then the symbols wouldn't be at risk of
wearing off from use.
</p>
<p>
However, my experiments with the stickers were dismal. Ink didn't
adhere to the plastic material at all, on either side. I quickly gave
up on that approach. In addition, I found that there was a very
limited selection of pens that could draw in opaque white, using
either gel ink or actual paint. (I guess traditionally speaking
there's no such thing as white ink.)
</p>
<p>
Deciding that I needed help from someone with more experience, I
dropped in at my neighborhood's maker space. The news there, however,
was discouraging. While they could name a few different ways to make
your own keyboard keys, they were all meant for mass production, and
they would cost ridiculous amounts of money. (Like, thousands of
dollars per keycap ridiculous.) They also confirmed my suspicion that
keyboard stickers would peel off sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>
Realizing that I maybe was taking the wrong approach to this, I walked
over to the nearest art supply store instead, and asked the staff
there what to do. Their recommendation? White enamel paint, due to its
opacity even when applied in a thin coat. And bonus point: enamel
paint cleans off easily with paint thinner, so I would be able to
erase mistakes.
<p>
Along with paint and thinner, I purchased the smallest paintbrushes I
could find in the store &mdash; a pair of 000 brushes made by two
different companies.
</p>
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/brushes.jpg" width="320" height="372"/>
</div>
<p>
Back home, I tried painting a couple of keys.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/singlekey.jpg" width="480" height="394"/>
</div>
<p>
Small as the brushes were, they still produced a thicker line than
what you normally find on a keyboard key. But it was thin enough to
produce clean, legible symbols in the confined space of a keycap.
Overall they looked good, and certainly far better than what any of my
original ideas would have produced.
</p>
<p>
So, I got down to work.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/halfempty.jpg" width="640" height="380"/>
</div>
<p>
As with any modern keyboard, the keys can be pried off easily, by
gently using any straight, thin piece of metal. Even though it
certainly didn't matter, I was religiously careful about keeping the
keys in order, and not letting them get switched around before
painting them.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/wireframe.jpg" width="320" height="384"/>
</div>
<p>
Many of the larger keys have a wire structure on the underside, which
keeps them level when they're being pressed. The ends fit into slots
in the bed of the keyboard, but otherwise they are inserted and
removed just like the other keys.
</p>
<p>
For my initial painting session, I rendered all the keys that
contained a single symbol.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/firstkeys.jpg" width="640" height="256"/>
</div>
<p>
Along with the 26 letters of the Triangle alphabet, this covered the
arrow keys, shift keys, the enter key, and a handful of keys on the
numeric keypad. I would start by first drawing the glyphs on all the
keys with a soft-lead pencil, making sure everything fit into the
upper-left quadrant of the keycap. The pencil marks were difficult to
see against the black plastic, but that also meant that I didn't need
to erase them before painting over them.
</p>
<p>
I quickly discovered a few things in the process. The line thickness
would vary unpleasantly when I changed the direction of my brush
stroke &mdash; in order to keep it even I had to stick to a downward
stroke as much as possible. Curved lines thus had to painted in
several steps, rotating the key in my fingers in between strokes. I
also found that it was easy to accidentally get way too much paint on
the brush when dipping it, which would result in a too-thick line
(both in width and in depth), so it was necessary to always paint on
the scratch paper first to verify the thickness before touching paint
to keycap.
</p>
<p>
Note that I also painted the twelve function keys, but I unthinkingly
located the glyph in the lower-right quadrant instead of the
upper-left. Later on, I went back and erased and repainted all of
them.
</p>
<p>
With fifty keys painted, I felt some degree of growing confidence, and
so began the next set &mdash; the keys with two glyphs stacked
vertically.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/numberkeys.jpg" width="576" height="128"/>
</div>
<p>
This set included the number keys, punctuation keys, and a few more
from the numeric keypad. Some symbols were more difficult than others
to fit into that tiny space. I'm looking at you, Triangle percent
sign. You're pretty to look at, but you're a nightmare to render on
half of a keycap.
</p>
<p>
(This photo also shows the still-gaping absences where the caret and
tilde symbols are supposed to be.)
</p>
<p>
The keys that were the hardest to do were the ones that contained
entire words. Some of these keys are wider than normal, such as
<tt>Ctrl</tt>, <tt>Alt</tt>, and <tt>CapsLock</tt>. But many of them
are standard sized, and I still had no idea how I was going to paint
those. One person suggested painting with a toothpick &mdash;
apparently this is a common technique for painting tiny details on D&D
miniatures. To my surprise this produced a line that was no thinner
than I got with my 000 brush.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/commandkeys.jpg" width="480" height="320"/>
</div>
<p>
In the end I just barely managed to get a thin enough line using the
same paintbrush I had been using with the other keys. How? By painting
very, very carefully. I thoroughly cleaned the brush with paint
thinner immediately beforehand, which temporarily slowed the
congealing of the paint on the brush. I touched the keycap with the
paintbrush as lightly as I could manage, avoiding any downward force
that could cause the bristles to spread out. And the toothpick turned
out to be useful after all: I discovered that I could use it, before
the paint had dried, to scrape away paint with more precision than I
could get using the paint thinner. I used the toothpick to scrape away
mistakes, and also as a way to make lines thinner by removing paint
along one edge. Once or twice I even used it to nudge the paint into
its desired position before it finished drying.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I continued to pester my daughter to determine what the
caret and tilde glyphs looked like. Initially I was careful to ask
offhandedly, fearful of raising her suspicions, but as December wore
on I began making outright demands. When she continued to profess
ignorance, I started offering exchanges of favors in return for these
symbols. This worked to get the caret, but the tidle remained elusive.
</p>
<p>
Finally, six days before Christmas, she received a bit of inspiration,
in exchange for help with dinner, and produced for me the Triangle's
tilde (complete with some evolutionary backstory). My relief was
palpable, and I painted the last keycap that evening.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/tildekey.jpg" width="480" height="256"/>
</div>
<p>
The next step was to apply some kind of protective finish to the keys,
since otherwise the paint would quickly erode from everyday usage. I
had heard that people sometimes used clear nail polish for such
things, with much success, but I wanted something that would leave a
thinner coating. Also, nail polish tends to be smooth and glossy, and
the tops of keyboard keys need to have a certain amount of friction to
minimize typos caused by slippage.
</p>
<p>
The staff at the art supply store recommended a spray-on clear-coat
finish. There was both a glossy version and a matte version available,
so the latter seemed ideal. They warned me that I would want to apply
three successive coats for it to stand up to the wear and tear of
typing.
</p>
<p>
Since I had never used this stuff before, I did some research online.
I quickly learned that for good results, I wanted to apply the finish
someplace that was well-ventilated, warm, and dry. Finding a place
having all three of those features simultaneously in Seattle &mdash;
in December &mdash; posed a very real problem. But they were all
necessary. If the place was poorly-ventilated, the fumes could be
dangerous. If the place was cold, the coating wouldn't cure properly,
or would take too long. And if it wasn't dry &mdash; well, I found
horror stories of the finish taking on a foggy opaqueness, and that
would ruin all of my hard work.
</p>
<p>
Lucky for me, a friend came through: His apartment building had a
basement room set aside for just this kind of project work. The room
was well-ventilated and dry, and came with some space heaters to
provide the otherwise missing warmth. Another friend instructed me
that a box turned on its side, with the opening facing the space
heater at a distance of a few feet, would create a warm place inside
which the finish would cure in a few minutes, despite the cold
environment.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/qtips.jpg" width="480" height="360"/>
</div>
<p>
In order to ensure that the keys remained in place and facing upright
while they were being sprayed and moved in and out of the box, I stuck
the ends of a bunch of Q-tips into a piece of cardboard.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/qtipboard.jpg" width="480" height="480"/>
</div>
<p>
This may have been more trouble than it was really worth. The keys on
this keyboard had large square posts on the underside, much larger in
diameter than the Q-tips, so they didn't fit snugly. I cut a couple of
them too long, which allowed those keys to list to one side or the
other. I suspect that I would have been fine just laying the keys out
in rows and being careful when moving them.
</p>
<p>
The matte finish worked perfectly, better than I had hoped. It was
completely invisible when it dried, and it perfectly preserved the
texture of the original keycaps. The only mistake I made was on the
first pass. I initially missed a corner of one of the shift keys. When
I gave it a brief extra spritz to cover the exposed area, I held the
can too close to the key (about 6 inches, instead of the recommended
9-12), and that part of the key developed some dim, gray circular
marks. Fortunately the effect was subtle, and didn't extend to the
painted part of the key.
</p>
<p>
I also had to do a bit of painting on the body of the keyboard, to
remove the keyboard's logo and the text labelling the LEDs. I cut out
three small rectangles of tape to cover and protect the lights, then
painted the entire section black. Once the paint had thoroughly dried,
I removed the tape and painted three new labels.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/ledlabels.jpg" width="480" height="240"/>
</div>
<p>
I could have clear-coated this painted part of the keyboard as well,
and in fact I should have. But that would have required me to put
protection on the neighboring areas of the keyboard, particularly the
interior of the keyboard bed, and I wasn't organized to have that
ready in time. So instead, I just applied some clear nail polish to
protect that part of the keyboard.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/nailpolish.jpg" width="320" height="320"/>
</div>
<p>
Unfortunately, the polish did not dry evenly over such a large area,
and wound up forming a rough, lumpy coating. The spray-on finish would
have looked much better. A minor flaw.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't until later that I discovered the keyboard's biggest flaw.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/backspace.jpg" width="640" height="320"/>
</div>
<p>
When I finally started putting the keys back onto the keyboard, I
found that I had actually managed to paint the backspace
key <i>upside-down</i>. Had I noticed before applying the finish, I
could have repainted it, but at this point it was much too late. It
was a very embarrassing mistake &mdash; but, if I had to accidentally
paint one key upside-down, I couldn't have chosen a better one. Almost
nobody noticed the error without my pointing it out, which certainly
wouldn't have been true if it had been, say, one of the
<tt>Alt</tt> keys.
</p>
<p>
At last, the finished product.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/finished.jpg" width="640" height="480"/>
</div>
<p>
Of course, when you've put this much effort into an unusual gift, it
simply demands an unusual presentation. It's not enough to just
gift-wrap it and stick it under the tree. The idea I had was to make
it look like it had been delivered through the mail, presumably from
the world of the Triangles.
</p>
<p>
I initially wrote the mailing address in Triangle, and then printed
out the address in a normal font and taped it onto the package,
covered with a small square of plastic wrap to make it look like the
second address had been attached by the post office.
</p>
<p>
Next, I went out and bought a random selection of foreign stamps from
a philately store. At a craft store specializing in rubber stamps, I
purchased a stamp that was a pattern of triangles, along with a purple
ink pad. The odd collection of stamps with a triangle-themed
cancellation made the perfect touch.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/stamps.jpg" width="640" height="284"/>
</div>
<p>
I had an opportunity to leave the package by the apartment mailboxes
on Christmas Eve when nobody was around, allowing the others to find
it and bring it inside. A very mysterious package indeed. (In theory
anyway. In reality, she knew full well that I was the only person
beside herself who was fluent enough in Triangle to make that
address.)
</p>
<p>
She opened the package first thing on Christmas morning, and found
herself the happy owner of a uniquely personal keyboard.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="keyboard/keyboardfull.jpg" width="768" height="320"/>
</div>
<p>
&hellip; Of course, now she wants a font to go with it.
