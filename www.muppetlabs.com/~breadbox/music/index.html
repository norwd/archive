<a href="homler/index.html">The Complete Anna Homler Discography</a>
<br>
Anna Homler is a vocalist who sings in a nonexistent language. Because
you cannot understand what her lyrics mean, her music invites you to
listen to the singing and the words as purely musical expressions.
Homler's own releases are scattered across a number of independent
labels, and in addition to this she has collaborated with a wide
variety of others artists. This page attempts to provide a list of all
of her recorded appearances.
