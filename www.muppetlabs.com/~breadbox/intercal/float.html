<h1>The INTERCAL floating-point library</h1>
<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In <a href="../intercal-man/index.html">the
INTERCAL manual</a>, section 8.4 offers the reader a handful of
INTERCAL programming projects. They are of widely varying difficulty
(though none of them are particularly easy [though again arguably is
no INTERCAL programming project]). But by the time I began to write
INTERCAL code, most of the suggested projects had already been
completed. There was, in fact, only two left (one of which was
predicated on the other):
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Compile a floating-point library, using 32-bit variables to represent
floating-point numbers.
<li>
Use said library to program a set of Fast Fourier Transform functions.
</ul>
<p>
So you see, I really had no choice in the matter. The only option open
to me was to write a floating-point library. And not only did it need
to provide the basic arithmetic operations including exponentiation,
but in order to implement FFT it also needed to supply the
trigonometric functions.
<p>
So, that's what I did.
<p>
One of the more minor obstacles to completing this task was that the
C-INTERCAL compiler, the only INTERCAL compiler generally available at
the time, had a hard limit of 1000 lines per program. The author (Eric
S. Raymond) had assumed, when he wrote it, that 1000 lines would be
sufficiently large to accomodate any single INTERCAL program likely to
be written, if not the total amount of INTERCAL code that would ever
be written. He, alas, was not a true INTERCAL programmer. The
floating-point library would ultimately require nearly twice that
space alone, never mind when added to an actual program. So in
addition to the floating-point library, I also contributed
improvements to the C-INTERCAL compiler to allow it to handle source
files of arbitrary size.
<p>
The timing for this work happened to be such that I was able to finish
all of the above in time for May 26th, 1997: the 25th anniversary of
INTERCAL. I thus coordinated to have the floating-point library, along
with the FFT program and the new version of the compiler, released
along with the improved compiler on that day.
<p>
As I stated at the time: "INTERCAL stands a living testament to the
Turing-completeness Theorem."
<p>
Here follows the complete documentation for the floating-point library.

Note: All of the above routines except <code>(5020)</code>, <code>(5060)</code

follows: <code>.5</code> will contain <code>#3</code> if the result
overflowed or if the arguments were out of domain, <code>#2</code> if
the result underflowed, <code>#1</code> otherwise. (See below for

<h2>Detailed description</h2>
<p>
The INTERCAL floating-point library uses the IEEE format for 32-bit
floating-point numbers, which uses bit 31 as a sign bit (1 being
negative), bits 30 through 23 hold the exponent with a bias of 127,
and bits 22 through 0 contain the fractional part of the mantissa with
an implied leading 1. In mathematical notation:
<p>
<blockquote>
  <b>N</b> = (1.0 + <i>fraction</i>) &middot; 2^(<i>exponent</i> &minus; 127)
                                     &middot; &minus;1^<i>sign</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus the range of floating-point magnitudes is, roughly, from
5.877472*10^-39 up to 6.805647*10^38, positive and negative. Zero is
specially defined as all bits 0. (Actually, to be precise, zero is
defined as bits 30 through 0 as being 0. Bit 31 can be 1 to represent
negative zero, which the library generally treats as equivalent to
zero, though don't hold me to that.)
<p>
Note that, contrary to the IEEE standard, exponents 0 and 255 are not
given special treatment (besides the representation for zero). Thus
there is no representation for infinity or not-a-numbers, and there is
no gradual underflow capability. Conformance with widely-accepted
standards was not considered to be a priority for an INTERCAL library.
(The fact that the general format conforms to IEEE at all is due to
the author doubting their ability to get anything done without being
able to lean upon some form of prior art.)
<p>
Here, for easy reference, are some common values as they would be
directly represented within an INTERCAL program:

<td class="label">Zero</td>
<td><code>#0$#0</code></td>
<tr>

<td><code>#571$#35133</code></td>
</table>
<p>
However, a more human-accessible representation of floating-point
numbers is made possible by the routines <code>(5080)</code> and
<code>(5090)</code>. For this representation, scientific notation is
used with six digits of precision after the decimal point. The seven
digits of the mantissa are suffixed with the two digits of the
exponent. If the number is negative, a one is prefixed (in the
billions' place), so there can be ten decimal digits in all. Finally,
if the exponent is negative, fifty is added. As is the usually the
case with scientific notation, the digit to the left of the decimal
point must be nonzero except for the case of zero itself.

The above may sound convoluted, but it is not nearly as confusing as
it perhaps should be. As an example, if you wished to enter the value
of the speed of light measured in centimeters per seconds squared, you
would type <tt>TWO NINE NINE SEVEN NINE TWO FIVE ONE OH</tt>. The
INTERCAL program would then call <code>(5080)</code> to transform this
into the floating-point number 2.997925e+10. The same value printed
out with the help of <code>(5090)</code> would appear as
ccxcixD&#773;C&#773;C&#773;X&#773;C&#773;MMDX. Similarly, the value
-1.602189e-19 (the charge of an electron measured in Coulombs) would
be represented respectively as <tt>ONE ONE SIX ZERO TWO ONE EIGHT NINE
SIX NINE</tt> and
mclxC&#773;C&#773;X&#773;V&#773;I&#773;I&#773;I&#773;CMLXIX. Note that
the negative sign on the exponent always translates to an L between
the fraction and the exponent when output.
<p>
The 16-bit variable <code>.5</code> is used by the floating-point
library as an error indicator. Upon return from most of the functions,
<code>.5</code> will normally be set to <code>#1</code> if the return
value is valid. If <code>.5</code> is set to <code>#2</code>, this
indicates that the result of the function underflowed (that is, the
magnitude of the result is less than 2^-127). If <code>.5</code> is
set to <code>#3</code>, this indicates either that the result
overflowed (magnitude greater than 2^128), or that the arguments to
the function were illegal. The latter can occur for the following
situations: division by zero (either via division or modulus),
negative root (either via square root or a fractional power), and
non-positive logarithm. Also, <code>(5070)</code> will
set <code>.5</code> to <code>#3</code> if the magnitude of the
argument is greater than 2^31, and <code>(5080)</code> will do
likewise if given a bad number (e.g., if it is greater than two
billion).
<p>
It may be worth nothing that there are some cases in which an under-
or overflow can be recovered from with tolerable grace. The sign and
fraction bits of such a value will usually still be correct, and the
exponent bits will just be the lower eight bits of the true exponent:
that is, the true exponent plus or minus 256 as appropriate. If such a
value is passed to another function as is, and the return value from
that over- or underflows in the opposite direction, it is likely that
the final result can be trusted. Of course, this depends entirely on
the nature of the operations involved, and this paragraph should not
be taken as advice to pursue such approaches in general, just as this
document should not be taken as advice to make use of this library at
all. Note also that in the case of <code>(5110)</code>, the
exponential function, and <code>(5130)</code>, the power function, it
is quite easy to request a massively under- and/or overflowed result.
In these cases the functions in question exit early, and attempting to
salvage something from such results, with the possible exception of
the sign bit, is pretty much guaranteed to be fruitless.
<p>
<code>(5020)</code> is the integral partition function (equivalent
to <code>modf()</code> in the C library). Both return values are
floating-point numbers, and both have the same sign as the argument,
such that <code>:2</code> + <code>:3</code> = <code>:1</code> while
keeping the magnitude of <code>:3</code> less than 1.
<p>
<code>(5060)</code> and <code>(5070)</code> are the "type-casting"
functions. They translate values to and from 32-bit two's-complement
integers. <code>(5070)</code> truncates any fractional amounts from
its argument, and will signal an error if the magnitude of the value
requires more than 32 bits.
<p>
The trigonometric functions <code>(5200)</code>, <code>(5210)</code>,
and <code>(5220)</code> will return erroneous results when given very
large arguments. At magnitudes around 8 million or so, the result is
occasionally off by one bit. The errors get progressively worse, so
that with magnitudes in the neighborhood of the quintillions and
higher, the number is wholly inaccurate. However, at magnitudes around
8 million, there is already a difference of over 20&pi; between
consecutive floating-point numbers, so it is hard to conceive of a
purpose for which improved accuracy would be useful.
<p>
In the descriptions for <code>(5410)</code> and <code>(5419)</code>,
&phi; refers to the golden ratio.
<p>
<h2>Internal routines</h2>
<p>
A floating-point library involves a fair amount of mathematical
functionality to begin with, something that INTERCAL is not generally
mistaken for having. The floating-point library therefore has a number
of internal functions to provide it with some 64-bit arithmetic, among
other things. While these routines were designed specifically for
internal use, and in many cases one would be hard-pressed to find
other uses for them in their current form, it was felt that they were
nonetheless worth documenting. Besides providing a guide for anyone so
foolish as to examine the actual code, it provides a sort of "itemized
bill" that helps to justify the inordinate size of the library.
<p>
In the following list, the notation <code>:1:2</code> simply indicates
that two 32-bit variables, in this example <code>:1</code>
and <code>:2</code>, are being used to hold a single 64-bit integer
value. The notation <code>:1:2.1</code>, on the other hand, indicates
a kind of double-precision floating-point value, a format that the
library uses frequently when storing intermediate values. The two
32-bit variables hold the fraction bits, with no implied bits, and
ideally with the highest 1 bit at bit 55. The 16-bit variable holds
the exponent, but with a bias of 639 instead of 127. This is done so
that underflows do not affect the sign, which is also stored in the
16-bit variable in bit 10. These intermediate values are rounded (to
even), truncated, and stored in a single 32-bit variable by the
floating-point normalization function, <code>(5600)</code>.
<p>
Finally, note that the numbers in the tables accessed by
routines <code>(5690)</code> through <code>(5693)</code> are generally
tailored for the function that applies them, and all of them use
slightly different representations for the values they encode.
<p>
