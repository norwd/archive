<h1>yapp</h1>
<p>
yapp stands for "yet another program printer", or "yet another
printing program", or maybe "yet another printer printer". Yeah,
probably "yet another printer printer". What yapp does is print out
programs that print out. That is, yapp takes whatever is piped into
its standard input, and produces on its standard output the source
code for an INTERCAL program that will, when compiled, produce the
original output.
<p>
Since producing output in an INTERCAL program calls for quite a few
lines of code just to store the character data in an array (see, for
example, beer.i), yapp attempts to minimze the size of the programs it
generates. The most important of these attempts is the fact that the
character data is actually stored four characters at a time, in a
32-bit, or hybrid, array. After this array has been filled in (which
usually is the vast majority of the generated program), a 16-bit, or
tail, array is filled with the unpacked character data. After the
latter array is output, the remaining lines print any leftover
characters (if the original input size was not evenly divisible by
four) and exit.
<p>
Other attempts to reduce size made by yapp are leaving out whitespace,
and avoiding use of the system library.
<p>
Here is an example of what yapp's output looks like. The parts that
change depending on the input data are marked with curly braces.
Whitespace has been added in a mostly-futile attempt to attain
legibility.

<p>
The first lines call the routine at <code>(9)</code>, which does
nothing but initialize <code>.4</code> with the size of the input
(indicated by <code>{N}</code>). The reason for this being a routine
is that yapp does not know what this number is until it has already
generated the lines at the top of the program, so it has to delay
inserting this information until the end. The value in <code>.4</code>
is then used to initialize <code>,1</code> and <code>;1</code>, the
latter being one-fourth as large. Our counter variable,
<code>.1</code>, is also set to zero.
<p>
The next lines fill <code>;1</code> with the character data
representing the input to yapp, four characters in each array
element. These lines represent yapp's real work. Everything besides
these lines and the line labelled <code>(9)</code> are the same for
every input. (Note: this is assuming that the size of the input is a
multiple of four. When this is not the case, a few more lines are
added in to directly output the leftover characters.)
<p>
The <code>COME FROM (1)</code> marks the top of the loop that
translates the contents of <code>;1</code> into <code>,1</code>. After
the counter value in <code>.1</code> is saved in <code>.2</code>, the
<code>COME FROM (3)</code> begins the inner loop of the modified
increment routine. Note that this routine is incrementing by four
instead of one. This is because <code>.1</code> is indirectly serving
as the index into <code>,1</code>, as well as the index into
<code>;1</code>. Since INTERCAL arrays are one-based, the index needs
to be stored in <code>.2</code> before being incremented. The
bottommost bits of <code>.2</code> can then be twiddled to index three
of the four <code>,1</code> elements to be initialized, and the value
in <code>.1</code> gives the fourth element. Shifting <code>.1</code>
right two bits also gives the index into <code>;1</code>.
<p>
The loop continues until <code>.1</code> is equal to <code>.4</code>,
at which point <code>,1</code> is filled and can be output.
