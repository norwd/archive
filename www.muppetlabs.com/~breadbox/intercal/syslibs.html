<h1>The Non-binary INTERCAL System Libraries</h1>
<p>
This project is easily my personal record for having the highest ratio
of INTERCAL code to documentation. Normally an INTERCAL program
requires a fair bit of explanation in order to use. However, this set
of five libraries needs none, as each one is simply a direct port of
the standard INTERCAL system library, already documented in the
<a href="../intercal-man/index.html">manual</a>.
<p>
The C-INTERCAL compiler introduced support for non-binary bases in its
wild adolescent era, but for many years afterwards there was no system
library available in those other bases. It was therefore extremely
difficult to get anything done in them, even if you had a solid grasp
of the non-binary logical operators. Frustrated with this ridiculous
situation, I eventually sat down and started porting the system
library.
<p>
Originally I was only going to port the ternary version, but once I
had finished that one, I realized that it was never going to be easier
to do the other four than it was right then, while the specifics of
the routines were still fresh in my mind. So I kept going until I had
all of them done.
<p>
Each library after the ternary version got bigger and slower, as each
higher base required more logical operations in order to do
multiplication and division. The library uses labels in the 1700s to
store internal subroutines. The one for base 7 is particularly
cumbersome. (If you are writing septary INTERCAL and are frustrated
with the slow speed of the multiplication and division routines, I
apologize, while also suggesting that if you can do significantly
better then please share your code with the rest of the class.)
<p>
The entire project took most of a summer. Two memories from that time
stick out in particular. The first is of being trapped in an airport
for several hours waiting for a connecting flight to arrive. I wound
up using that time to start composing the quartary library, writing
several pages of INTERCAL code in pencil in my notebook. The second
memory is from when I was porting the sexary libray. After finishing
the port, testing revealed a bug that I hadn't seen before and didn't
understand. Later that week I was out drinking with friends when a
possible cause for the bug suddenly popped into my head. I went home
hours later, and although I was quite inebriated by then I was able to
recall the idea and successfully fix the bug. (I have never worked on
code while intoxicated to that degree before or since.)
<p>
The link at top will download a tarball containing the full set of
libraries. However, they are included as part of the C-INTERCAL
compiler distribution, so if you have the compiler you should already
have the libraries. As with the original binary system library, the
compiler automatically includes the library if any of its routines are
invoked.
