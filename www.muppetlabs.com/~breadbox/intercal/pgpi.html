<h1>INTERCAL: Practically Impossible</h1>

<p>A very good friend of mine has been experimenting with trying to
coax Chat-GPT4 to successfully do basic coding tasks. So have a lot of
people these days, of course. In an idle moment, though, my friend
submitted the following query:</p>

<table class="openai query">
  <tr><td>
  <div style="width:30px;height:30px;background-color:#ab68ff;text-align:center;border-radius:.125rem;"><svg stroke="#ffffff" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 -2 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1.5rem" width="1.5rem" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M20 21v-2a4 4 0 0 0-4-4H8a4 4 0 0 0-4 4v2"></path><circle cx="12" cy="7" r="4"></circle></svg></div>
  </td><td>
  <p>Please write a password generation program using the Intercal
  computer programming language.</p>
  </td></tr>
</table>

<p>And <em>this</em> was the program's response:</p>

  <p>INTERCAL is a esoteric programming language that was created as a
  parody. It's known for its complex and counter-intuitive syntax.
  Writing a password generation program in INTERCAL would be quite a
  challenge and the result would be difficult to understand and
  maintain.</p>

  <p>INTERCAL has no built-in functions for random number generation
  or string manipulation, which are typically used in password
  generation programs. It also lacks the ability to interact with
  external libraries that could provide these functionalities.
  Therefore, creating a password generator in INTERCAL is practically
  impossible.</p>

  <p>However, if you're interested in INTERCAL, here's a simple
  program that prints "Hello, World!" to give you an idea of what
  INTERCAL code looks like:</p>

  <blockquote class="INTERCAL">
<span class="zk">DO</span> :<span class="zn">1</span> &lt;- #<span class="zn">13</span>
PLEASE <span class="zk">DO</span> :<span class="zn">1</span> <span class="zk">SUB</span> #<span class="zn">1</span> &lt;- #<span class="zn">238</span>
<span class="zk">DO</span> :<span class="zn">1</span> <span class="zk">SUB</span> #<span class="zn">2</span> &lt;- #<span class="zn">108</span>
<span class="zk">DO</span> :<span class="zn">1</span> <span class="zk">SUB</span> #<span class="zn">3</span> &lt;- #<span class="zn">112</span>
<span class="zk">DO</span> :<span class="zn">1</span> <span class="zk">SUB</span> #<span class="zn">4</span> &lt;- #<span class="zn">0</span>
<span class="zk">DO</span> :<span class="zn">1</span> <span class="zk">SUB</span> #<span class="zn">5</span> &lt;- #<span class="zn">64</span>
<span class="zk">DO</span> :<span class="zn">1</span> <span class="zk">SUB</span> #<span class="zn">6</span> &lt;- #<span class="zn">194</span>
<span class="zk">DO</span> :<span class="zn">1</span> <span class="zk">SUB</span> #<span class="zn">7</span> &lt;- #<span class="zn">48</span>
PLEASE READ OUT :<span class="zn">1</span>
PLEASE GIVE UP

</blockquote>

  <p>This program uses the "DO" statement to assign values to variables, and
  the "PLEASE READ OUT" statement to print the result. The numbers are in
  a base-10 representation of the ASCII values of the characters in
  "Hello, World!".</p>

  <p>If you're interested in password generation, I'd recommend using a
  language that's better suited to the task, such as Python, Java, or
  JavaScript. These languages have built-in libraries for random number
  generation and string manipulation, and are widely used for practical
  programming tasks.</p>

<p>Now, I have a few things to say about this response, both good and
bad. But before I get properly into the weeds, let me just share with
you my friend's followup comment:</p>

  <p>Oh, I'm sorry. Was this too difficult for you? I know someone who
  wrote a floating-point library for Intercal, so I thought maybe an
  generative AI could write a simple thing like a password generator.
  Forgive me for troubling you.</p>

<p>This here? This is why we are such good friends. But anyway,
Chat-GPT's response to his bit of snark is more or less what you would
expect:</p>

  <p>I apologize if my previous response gave the impression that it's
  impossible to write a password generator in INTERCAL. While INTERCAL is
  indeed a challenging language due to its esoteric nature, it's not
  impossible to create a password generator. However, it would be quite
  complex and not straightforward due to the language's limitations and
  unique syntax.</p>

  <p>The main challenge is that INTERCAL lacks built-in functions for random
  number generation or string manipulation, which are typically used in
  password generation programs. It also lacks the ability to interact
  with external libraries that could provide these functionalities.</p>

  <p>If someone has written a floating-point library for INTERCAL, they have
  likely implemented a significant amount of functionality that is not
  native to the language. This is a significant achievement, but it's not
  something that can be easily replicated in a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Again, I apologize if my previous response was disappointing. If you
  have any other questions or need help with anything else, please don't
  hesitate to ask.</p>

<p>As I've noticed in the past, followup responses from Chat-GPT
generally tend to be a bit more factually accurate than initial
responses. (Whether that is due to gleaning cues from human feedback,
or just because the program tries alternate options in response to any
complaint, is a question for others to explore.)</p>

<p>If you haven't already guessed, I am the person who wrote a
floating-point library for INTERCAL.<a href="pgpi.html#note1"
id="note1ref">¹</a> Chat-GPT is correct that it required "a
significant amount of functionality that is not native to the
language", but I mean duh. So did all the floating-point libraries
that people wrote back in the 1990s, when floating-point coprocessors
were optional. So what? That observation is hardly relevant to this
query in particular or INTERCAL in general. (Though I suppose one
could argue that my friend's snark isn't really relevant either. Fair
enough. However, I do find it interesting how Chat-GPT responds so
politely to the type of shade that might have spurred a more human
programmer into action.) I will say that while the floating-point
library was technically challenging to write, probably the most
challenging INTERCAL program I've written is the quine that I managed
to squeeze down to under 4kB.<a href="pgpi.html#note2" id="note2ref">²</a></p>

<p>Now, I haven't done any significant INTERCAL programming in
decades. After some futile attemtps to get a job as an INTERCAL
programmer, I was forced to spend my time acquiring more marketable
resume bullet points, and my INTERCAL skills have lain largely fallow
since. But don't think that they have deserted me entirely—nor that I
care any less about defending my chosen esoteric language from
misinformation promulgated by thoughtless neural networks.</p>

<p>But I have very little to say about the second response. It's
mostly a repetition of a few points made in the first response, along
with one or two mostly accurate asides.</p>

<p>So. Let's examine that first response, shall we?</p>

<p>First, a positive. Kudos to Chat-GPT for spelling the language as
INTERCAL (all uppercase), despite my friend's use of the more common
spelling. I do appreciate that this chatbot is doing its part to
promulgate the original manual's rendering. Yes, I realize that the
habit of writing computer language names in all-caps died out with the
advent of display devices with lowercase letter support, and languages
like FORTRAN and LISP and BASIC were all rebranded thusly. But I mean
come on—if any language should evince disinterest in escaping the
1970s, it is INTERCAL.</p>

<p>As for the rest, Chat-GPT remains true to form in that, like most
bullshitters, it succeeds most when it confines itself to
generalities. The moment it blunders into specificity, it gets itself
in trouble.</p>

<p>First, it states that a password generator written in INTERCAL
"would be difficult to understand and maintain." Fine, I'll grant
that—it's about as true as a subjective statement can be. Then, it
claims that "INTERCAL has no built-in functions for random number
generation or string manipulation". <em>I beg your pardon.</em></p>

<p>Arguably, most computer languages have no built-in functions for
random number generation, since that functionality is typically
relegated to a standard library. Nonetheless, pseudo-random number
generation only requires a couple of basic arithmetic operations, so
even if it wasn't in the standard library, it's not hard to whistle up
some numbers that are random enough for a simple password
generator.</p>

<p>That said, you might be tempted to give me a hard time and point
out that in INTERCAL, even basic arithmetic operators are only
supplied by the standard library, and so therefore Chat-GPT's
assertion is still technically accurate. (You might argue this even
though you really ought to know that as soon as you move your
goalposts to "technically accurate", you're already in trouble.) If
you did argue this, I would freely acknowledge that
your <em>premise</em> is true. But it doesn't make a difference, you
dipstick, because INTERCAL has random-number generation <em>built
right into the language</em>.</p>

<p>Gaze upon this, and weep at its elegance:</p>

<blockquote class="INTERCAL">
    <span class="k">DO</span> <span class="v">.1</span> &lt;- <span class="n">#0</span>
    <span class="k">DO</span> <span class="x">%50</span> <span class="v">.1</span> &lt;- <span class="n">#1</span>

</blockquote>

<p>After the above two lines execute, the variable <code>.1</code>
will be equally likely to contain either zero or one.
The <code>%50</code> in the second line means that it will only
execute half of the time the program runs. Far from being difficult,
randomness is a language <em>primitive</em>. I ask you, here and now,
what could be more transparent?</p>

<p>As for Chat-GPT's comment about a lack of string manipulation—sure,
that is completely true. And completely irrelevant. Nobody needs
string manipulation to write a bloody password generator (unless maybe
your password generator is double-checking to make sure the RNG didn't
go and dredge up something like "passw0rd" or "sexgod69"). The fact
that Chat-GPT throws "no string manipulation" down like some kind of
trump card merely demonstrates that it doesn't fully grasp the nature
of the suggested task.</p>

<p>But this is no surprise, for if Chat-GPT possessed a scintilla of
self-awareness, we would not have been treated to the rest of its
response. "However, if you're interested in INTERCAL, here's a simple
program that prints 'Hello, World!'"</p>

<p>Oh Chat-GPT, I would have respected you more if you had simply
shut up.</p>

<p>Now, it isn't much of a surprise that Chat-GPT selected hello-world
to demonstrate its knowledge of INTERCAL programming. My hunch is that
a signifcant percentage of all INTERCAL programs written are
hello-world programs (as that is usually enough to convince most
programmers that first, the INTERCAL compiler is real, and second,
that they have better things to do with their time). Ergo, I imagine
that this is more likely than any other "task" to have enough training
data to keep Chat-GPT on the rails from soup to nuts. Let us venture
forth and find out how well it did.</p>

<span class="k">PLEASE GIVE UP</span>
  </blockquote>

<p>(Side note: I won't fault the interface for doing such a terrible
job of syntax highlighting, because how can I get mad at anyone for
assuming that no one is likely to submit INTERCAL code to their
syntax-highlighting routine? At the same time, I'm sure as hell not
going to promulgate its piebald spatter any further.)</p>

<p>I'll give it one thing. This program does compile successfully.
Unfortunately that's not a very high bar to clear, as INTERCAL treats
syntax errors as run-time exceptions. The syntax error this particular
bit of code sports is that <code>:1</code> is not an array, and thus
cannot be subscripted. The compiled program crashes on line two: "E"
for effort.</p>

<p>Still, let's be generous and fix that. It's the type of mistake any
newbie might make, if they hadn't bothered to read the documentation
at all. We will replace <code>:1</code> with <code>,1</code>
throughout, as this is clearly what was intended. This version of the
program runs! It even outputs a string, namely:
"<tt>Hello,       </tt>". Which is exactly what one would expect from
even a cursory examination of the code. The program allocates a
13-element array, but only the first seven elements are
initialized.</p>

<p>I'm unsure exactly how Chat-GPT managed to regurgitate the first
half of a valid array initialization sequence and then still get lost.
My vague suspicion is that the next line of whatever actual hello-world
INTERCAL program that Chat-GPT is indirectly cadging from began
with <code>PLEASE</code>, and this disruption of the pattern was
enough for its Markov-chain logic to leap across the rest of the
initialization code to the <code>PLEASE READ OUT</code> statement at
the end of the program.</p>

<p>The bot's lack of understanding is further demonstrated by the
explication it supplies, which vaguely suggests that <code>DO</code>
is an assignment statement. (To be clear, <code>&lt;-</code> is the
assignment operator; <code>DO</code> and <code>PLEASE</code> are
simply how every statement is introduced.). The next sentence then
blithely comments that the array values "are in a base-10
representation of the ASCII values of the characters." I mean, okay?
Like, thanks for reassuring me that the values are not EBCDIC
characters in base 11; I had assumed that already but with INTERCAL
it's not always safe to make assumptions. But, no thanks for blatantly
glossing over the fact that the array values are
actually <em>bit-reversed sequential differences</em> of ASCII values.
Presumably that nugget of information was too picayune to be worth
mentioning.</p>

<p>Ultimately, though, I do have to award Chat-GPT points for
successfully pretending to understand that the partially-digested
sequence it produced was (originally) an INTERCAL program, and one
that output a traditional salutary greeting.</p>

<p>Finally, I must address the statement that prompted me to sit down
in front of my keyboard and bang out this whole ridiculous essay,
intsead of moving on with my life. Smack in the middle of this
mulligatawny, Chat-GPT opines:</p>

<p>"Therefore, creating a password generator in INTERCAL is practically
impossible."</p>

<p>Okay, you know what, Chat-GPT? <b>Fuck you.</b> Yes, it is
perfectly valid, if not actually <i>de rigeur</i>, for an INTERCAL
programmer to cast aspersions upon the language at every opportunity.
But, as we have already established, <em>you</em> are not an INTERCAL
programmer. You've made that blisteringly clear with your literally
half-assed sample program, and you have made it doubly clear with that
comment. Granted, INTERCAL may be a mad, freakish chimera of a parody
of IBM mainframe language design crossed with the gleeful chaos of the
Turing tarpit. But it's <em>my</em> mad, freakish chimera of a … oh
you get the point.</p>

<p>So here you go, you libellous word bucket. The following INTERCAL
program is a password generator. When executed, it creates passwords
of length 16. It avoids using various characters that are easily
confused with each other (such as "1", "I", "i", "l", "!", and "/").
Generated passwords are guaranteed to include at least one digit and
one punctuation mark.</p>

<p>Far from being practically impossible, I wrote it in an afternoon.
(Okay, plus a bit of post-1.0 debugging in the evening.) That may
strike you as rather slow for such a straightforward task, but that's
because you don't realize that there is no such thing as
"straightforward" when it comes to INTERCAL. (Also, like I said, my
INTERCAL skills are rusty.)</p>

<p>Next time you trash-talk my beloved INTERCAL, you better understand
what you're saying. Got that? All right. Thank you for your attention:
breadbox out.</p>

<p><i>Post Scriptum:</i> The program shown here in written in the
C-INTERCAL dialect, in order to take advantage of its character-based
output capabilities. But for the sake of purists (i.e. myself), I also
wrote a version that constrains itself to the language defined by the
original 1972 Princeton compiler. Instead of character output, it
simply displays a sequence of sixteen numbers (as Roman numerals, it
should go without saying), which form the chosen password when read as
ASCII values. Alternately, I have provided a third version will output
the password as EBCDIC values instead. Never say that INTERCAL
programmers don't care about portability. A tarball containing all
three versions can be downloaded from the link below.<a href="pgpi.html#note3"
