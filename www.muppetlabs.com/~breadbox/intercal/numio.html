<h1>numio.i</h1>
<p>
The numio library is a short collection of routines to help one with
doing the short of input and output that other languages have
mistakenly caused the average programmer to take for granted. When
tracking the state of INTERCAL's Turing-tape feels too uninterestingly
annoying to be worth managing, or when you just really need to output
numbers without being insulted by your standard error stream, this
collection of routines is available to let you off the hook you
deserve to remain upon.
<p>
Here is the complete summary of routines provided by numio.i:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><code>(3000)</code></td>
<td><code>.1 &lt;-</code> character from input</td>
<tr>
<td><code>(3001)</code></td>
<td>Prints <code>.2</code> as a character</td>
<tr>
<td><code>(3010)</code></td>
<td><code>,1 &lt;-</code> a string of input from the user, no longer than <code>.1</code>, and<br>
    excluding the terminating newline.<br>
    <code>.2 &lt;-</code> the real length of the user input.<br>
    <code>.3 &lt;- #1</code> if <code>.2</code> &leq; <code>.1</code> (i.e., no characters were lost).<br>
    Otherwise, <code>.3 &lt;- #2.</code></td>

<p>
numio.i reserves the use of two arrays &mdash; <code>,3000</code>
and <code>,3001</code> &mdash; for input and output respectively. Each
array has one dimension of one element, and they are used to provide
a <i>getchar</i> routine, at <code>(3000)</code>, and a <i>putchar</i>
routine, <code>(3001)</code>. Note that <code>(3001)</code> expects
that the character values have already been bit-reversed. The arrays
are initialized by routine <code>(3990)</code>; this should be called
before using any other routines in this library.
<p>
Routines <code>(3010)</code> and <code>(3020)</code> provide line
input capabilities. The routines write in characters until they see a
newline (or end-of-file), and store them in <code>,1</code>. They are
called with <code>.1</code> being the number of characters to save;
any input after that is thrown away. (Already they're better than C's
<code>gets()</code>!)
<p>
<code>(3010)</code> returns the actual number of characters that were
input in <code>.2</code>, and <code>.3</code> is set
to <code>#2</code> if characters were lost (i.e., if <code>.2</code>
is longer than <code>.1</code>). I decided to add <code>.3</code>,
even though the caller could check for this themselves, as inequal
comparisons are a bit painful in INTERCAL. Or, to be accurate, they're
more painful than equal comparisons. Note also that if <code>.1</code>
is <code>#0</code>, the routine becomes a press-Enter-to-continue type
of function, and <code>,1</code> need not actually be defined.
<p>
<code>(3020)</code> is a filtering, or translating, input routine.
When called, the array <code>,2</code> should contain a set of
"approved" characters that are expected to be in the input,
and <code>.2</code> should contain the number of characters
in <code>,2</code>. As input is retrieved, the routine looks up each
character in <code>,2</code>. If the character is approved, the
routine stores in <code>,1</code> the index of the character instead.
(Otherwise the actual character number is stored, as
with <code>(3010)</code>.) Upon return, <code>.3</code> has the number
of characters that were input, and <code>.4</code> is set
to <code>#2</code> if characters were lost <em>or</em> if any
characters in the input were not in the set of approved characters.
<p>
The remaining routines are for doing "wimpmode"-style I/O - or in
other words, the C-INTERCAL equivalent of <i>atoi</i>
and <i>itoa</i>. <code>(3080)</code> and <code>(3090)</code> translate
the ASCII input as a number (yes, a number as in <code>[0-9]*</code>),
and <code>(3090)</code> and <code>(3190)</code> do the same for
displaying numbers in ASCII. (By the way, the routines can also be
made to support EBCDIC: simply replace <code>#3</code>
with <code>#15</code> on lines 41, 81, and 107.)
<p>
Each routine also has a "niner" variation.
For <i>itoa</i>, <code>(3099)</code> and <code>(3190)</code> print a
newline at the end of the number. In the case
of <i>atoi</i>, <code>(3089)</code> and <code>(3189)</code> make sure
that the number ends with a newline. In other words, they ensure there
are no other non-numeric characters in the input line. If there are, a
typically snide INTERCAL error message is displayed. (The regular
versions work like C's <code>atoi()</code> in that they return as soon
as they see any non-digit.)
<p>
There's not too much else to note about these routines.
The <i>atoi</i> routines use the shift-and-add trick to avoid
multiplying by 10, so they should be pretty efficient
(snort). <i>itoa</i> has no such shortcuts, and the routines use the
modified division routine which also returns the remainder. The 16-bit
version is at <code>(2030)</code>, and is the familiar one created by
Louis Howell, copied from syslib2.i. The 32-bit version is
at <code>(2530)</code>, and is just a copy of the standard library
routine without the lines that throw away the remainder at the end.
<p>
Note also that for these routines to work properly, they must be used
more or less exclusively in regards to other array I/O. Otherwise, the
<i>getchar</i> and <i>putchar</i> subroutines will get out of synch
with the Turing-text character loop. If you do want to do other I/O
while using these routines, you can use <code>(3000)</code>
and <code>(3001)</code> as a <i>getchar</i> and <i>putchar</i>. Or,
you can simply re-initialize the <code>,3000</code>
and/or <code>,3001</code> values after you are done, by storing in
them the ASCII value of the last character that you wrote in and/or
read out. For example, if you have displayed some strings and the last
thing to be printed was a newline, then:
<p>
<pre>	DO ,3001SUB#1 <- #80</pre>
<p>
would allow you to safely call the <i>itoa</i> routines, since 80 is the
bit-reversal of 10.
