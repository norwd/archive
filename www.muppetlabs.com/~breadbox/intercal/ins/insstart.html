<h2>How to Play the Game</h2>
<p>
Intersections &amp; Splats is an INTERCAL implementation of
one of my favorite games, Cows &amp; Bulls (more commonly
known these days by the commercial version, Mastermind). And
now it is an INTERCAL CGI script as well, which is what this page is
an introduction to.
<p>
<h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
<p>
The idea of the game is that one person selects a "code" in the form
of a short string of digits, typically four. (Mastermind used colors
in place of numbers.) The other person has a limited number of chances
to guess what the code is. Every move consists of submitting a guess,
and the first player replying with a score. Each scoring reveals a
little more information about the code. A guess is scored by giving a
certain number of cows and a certain number of bulls. These correspond
to Mastermind's white pegs and black pegs, respectively - and, in this
program, intersections (<samp>+</samp>) and splats (<samp>*</samp>).
(These names come from the INTERCAL language, by the way.)
<p>
This game is perfect for a computer because the person who makes the
code has nothing to do but score the other player's guesses - a
mechanical task.
<p>
Here's how the scoring works. For every number in the code that is
matched by the same number in the same position in the guess, a splat
is scored. And for every number in the code that is matched by the
same number in the guess, but in the wrong position, an intersection,
is scored.
<p>
For example: with a code of "3451", and a guess of "2465", one splat
and one intersection would be earned. The splat is for the 4, and the
intersection is for the 5. Of course, the player making the guesses
isn't told which numbers earned what - that's what they have to
deduce. A guess of "6152" gets exactly the same score, even though the
intersection and splat correspond to completely different digits.
<p>
The game continues until the code is discovered or the player runs out
of guesses.
<p>
<h3>More About Scoring</h3>
<p>
Note that there can be some confusion about how the scoring works with
repeated digits. In absence of a better standards body, I have stuck
with the version described in the Mastermind rules, which is that a
digit in the guess can match up with more than one digit in the code.
Another example is in order. Say the code is "2412". A guess of "2544"
would earn one splat and two intersections. The splat is for having a
2 in the guess in the right position, and one of the intersections is
also for having a 2 in the guess, but in the wrong position. The other
intersection is earned by having a 4 in the guess, again in the wrong
position. The second 4 in the guess, however, does not affect the
scoring.
<p>
Here is an algorithmic description of how scoring is done. The
computer looks at each digit in the code in turn. If the digit under
consideration is matched by the same digit in the same place, a splat
is earned. Otherwise, if any other digit in the guess is the same, an
intersection is earned.
<p>
Play the game a few times; you'll get the idea.
<p>
<h2>The Mechanics of the Game</h2>
<p>
At every turn the board is displayed. The board shows all of the
guesses you have made so far. Above each guess are the intersections
and splats that they earned. Here is an example of a game in progress:
<p><pre>
           +    
 * +  +    * *  
 (1)  (5)  (2)  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )   (?)
 (2)  (4)  (4)  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )   (?)
 (4)  (4)  (3)  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )   (?)
 (2)  (6)  (5)  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )   (?)

 IV
</pre><p>
The first guess "1242" earned one splat and one intersection. The
third guess "2435" earned two splats and one intersection. The Roman
numeral "IV" (four) indicates that the game is waiting for the player
to make their fourth guess.
<p>
Guesses are entered into a text entry field, situated directly below
the board. After the guess is ready, the MOVE button is pushed to
continue. The script will put the guess on the board and give it a
score.
<p>
At the end of the game, whether you win or lose, the questions marks
disappear and the code is displayed. You can then play another game
with the same setup, or come back to this page and choose a different
configuration.
<p>
You can leave the game at any time by selecting the EXIT link. Also,
during the game, you can push the RESIGN button if you want to give up
and see the code.
<p>
<h3>Configuring the Game</h3>
<p>
The game is set up originally to have ten guesses in a game, four
digits in the code, and to use the digits 1 through 6. (This matches
the setup of the Mastermind version.) By modifying these settings, you
can control the difficulty of the game. Increasing the size of the
code or the number of digits to use will make the game harder;
increasing the number of guesses will give you more opportunities to
gather information. (I myself often play with six digits in the code,
and using all nine possible digits.)
<p>
Note that if you enter a configuration that is not within the given
ranges, you will get a page with a succinct error message. Select
<samp>RETURN</samp> or use your browser's "Back" feature to return here.
<p>
<h3>The Source</h3>
<p>
If you're curious, the source code is available. The source code
distribution includes documentation, a standalone version that
runs in the terminal, and a bonus colorized version for vt100/ANSI
color terminals.

That's it. Have fun. Questions, comments, bug reports and inquiries
