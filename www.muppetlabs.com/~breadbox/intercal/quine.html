<h3>Quines and INTERCAL</h3>
<p>
A basic feature of any quine is that it must have some chunk of data
which is output twice: once as code, and once as data (i.e., itself).
In a language that has identical representations for code and data,
such as Lisp, creating this data can be relatively straightforward. In
a language with powerful and terse string-manipulation capabilities,
such as Perl, the data can be very small.
<p>
And then we have INTERCAL. Not only does INTERCAL have no concept of
"data-as-code", it has no strings, as such. It quickly becomes clear
that a large part of any INTERCAL quine will have to consist of many
numbers to be output as the characters of the source code. The largest
INTERCAL variable is the 32-bit integer, into which four characters
can be interleaved, and then later unpacked and stored in an array to
be output. Since there is no way to assign a value to more than one
variable per statement, that adds up to a lot of statements.
<p>
<h3>Earlier INTERCAL Quines</h3>
<p>
The first INTERCAL quine I ever created was in February of 1997, and
it was 18871 bytes long. It contained 644 statements, of which 530
were devoted to initializing a hybrid array. The next section of the
program was the part that output these 530 lines of source code, and
consisted of roughly 75 lines itself. (Much of those lines were for
the routine to output a number in ASCII characters.) The remaining
section created a tail array of 2120 elements, into which the
interleaved characters in the hybrid array were separated out and
stored, and then a single <code>READ OUT</code> brought the program to
completion.
<p>
Having actually completed a successful INTERCAL quine, I then began to
wonder about how to go about making it smaller. At first I
concentrated on tightening up the code, reasoning that any savings
would shrink the size of the array as well. However, I soon realized
that the routines were already pretty skeletal, and there wasn't much
I could do in that direction. (Although much later I would revise my
opinion on that score.) That left me with the option of making the
data itself more compact, and using slightly larger code to produce
the actual characters. It didn't take long before the idea of using
Huffman compression came to mind. Huffman compression is almost ideal
for this task, since all the real work is up front in the encoding
stage, and specifically in building the character translation table.
The actual decoding process can be done in two lines of (obfuscated)
C, once the binary tree is reconstructed, and mainly involves
bit-twiddling, an activity that INTERCAL excels at (relatively
speaking).
<p>
My first successful quine with Huffman compression was 11323 bytes
long, completed in May 1997. In November 1998 I went on a protracted
campaign of making the program shorter, and eventually released a
version that was a mere 9130 bytes. This quine consisted of 412
statements, of which 292 statements initialized a hybrid array. This
array contained the binary tree defining the Huffman code in its first
48 elements, with the remaining 244 elements being the encoded
"bitstream".
<p>
In August 2003, I picked up the quine again and worked on making it
smaller still. I made a modification to the Huffman compression
wherein a given encoded symbol could automatically imply some number
of bits to implicitly follow it. (Thus, for example, because the
character <code>D</code> was always followed by an <code>O</code>
character, all but the last bit of the code for <code>O</code> could
be dropped from the bitstream.) This along with several reductions of
the INTERCAL code itself allowed me to produce a quine that was 6758
bytes in size. This quine consisted of 323 statements, with a hybrid
array of 211 elements: 41 for the Huffman tree, and 169 for the
bitstream.
<p>
By this point I had become aware of the large amount of redundancy in
the INTERCAL code, which even my variant Huffman compression couldn't
take advantage of. However, switching to a more powerful compression
scheme seemed hopeless. The INTERCAL routine that decompressed the
Huffman-encoded bitstream was extremely terse. A more powerful
compression scheme would be counterbalanced by requiring a larger
amount of code to do the decompression. I looked around for
compression schemes that allowed for trivial decompression algorithms,
and eventually found one, called "Re-Pair".
<p>
<h3>Re-Pair Compression Overview</h3>
<p>
Re-Pair is short for "recursive pairing". (The name comes from a
paper, "Offline Dictionary-Based Compression", by N. Jesper Larsson
and Alistair Moffat. The term "byte pair" encoding is also sometimes
seen.) Re-Pair compression uses a very simple coding scheme, in which
frequently-occuring pairs of symbols are replaced by a single symbol,
previously unused. A dictionary is thus created matching pairs of
symbols to new symbols. Note that either or both of the symbols in the
pair might themselves be dictionary entries. In this manner, long
repeated sections can be encoded.
<p>
The simplest approach for encoding a stream in this manner is as
follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Scan the plaintext and find the most frequently-occuring pair of
symbols.
<li>
Replace the chosen pair everywhere it appears in the plaintext with a
single new symbol.
<li>
Append the encoding of the pair as the new symbol to the dictionary.
<li>
Repeat, until no pair of symbols occurs more than once in the
plaintext.
</ol>
<p>
There are more sophisticated approaches, of course, but for short
strings this greedy algorithm usually works as well as any other.
<p>
Decompressing a symbol from the compressed stream can be done with a
simple recursive procedure:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Look up the symbol in the dictionary.
<li>
If the symbol does not have an entry, output the symbol directly.
<li>
Otherwise, decompress the left-hand symbol in the entry, and then
decompress the right-hand symbol in the entry.
</ol>
<p>
The main drawback of this scheme is that compression is slow, and
requires a fair amount of memory.
<p>
<h3>The Current INTERCAL Quine</h3>
<p>
The INTERCAL quine presented here, written on 30 June 2004, is 3629
bytes long. The Re-Pair compression scheme is the main reason for the
improved compactness over previous quines. Also, the program's
routines were completely rewritten in order to make the source more
amenable to Re-Pair compression. Other techniques for shrinking the
total size include juggling the assignment of dictionary index values
so that the compressed string would require fewer characters when
represented as decimal values in the source code, and doing a
heuristic search for a set of line labels that maximized overall
compression.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The following is a detailed description of the quine program. Note
that the lines of code quoted here have been re-formatted for
legibility; in the program, they are completely bereft of whitespace.
<p>
As always when analyzing a quine, there are two possible incarnations
of the program to consider. One is the program that is executing, the
other is the program that is being output. From the latter point of
view, the program comes in three sections. The first section creates a
hybrid array, the second section initializes the array's elements, and
the third section contains everything else. The first section consists
of a single statement, and is output directly at the end of the
initialization routine. The second section is output by reconstructing
the initialization statements from the array values. The third section
is output by decompressing the bytestream stored in the array.
<p>
Here are the first two sections of the program:
<p>
<pre>
	    DO ;2 &lt;- #255
	    DO ;2SUB#1 &lt;- #23948$#3181
	    DO ;2SUB#2 &lt;- #2568$#53882
	    DO ;2SUB#3 &lt;- #8776$#4650
	    DO ;2SUB#4 &lt;- #1260$#40490
	[ ... skipping 99 lines ... ]
	    DO ;2SUB#104 &lt;- #46820$#8021
	    DO ;2SUB#105 &lt;- #14955$#6781
	    DO ;2SUB#106 &lt;- #3484$#38981
	    DO ;2SUB#107 &lt;- #62208$#0
</pre>
<p>
In order for the dictionary to be simple to store and consult, the
quine uses byte values above 128 for dictionary symbols. Values below
128 are automatically treated as ASCII character values. Because
output values are bit-reversed, this translates into: even values
represent ASCII characters, odd values represent dictionary entries.
<p>
The dictionary is stored in the first 63 elements of the hybrid array,
with two entries per element. Since INTERCAL arrays don't have a zero
element, only 126 dictionary entries are available. Entries for
symbols 129 through 191 are stored in the top 16 bits of each array
element, and entries for symbols 193 through 255 are stored in the
bottom 16 bits. Each 16-bit value in turn contains two 8-bit symbol
values, the left-hand symbol being in the top 8 bits.
<p>
The other 44 array elements comprise the bytestream that, when
decompressed, recreates the program's third and final section.
<p>
Note, by the way, that none of the above lines begin with
<code>PLEASE</code>. All of the quine's politesse is packed into the
rest of the program.
<p>
The final element of <code>;2</code> is special in two ways. First and
most visibly, it is the only entry that has all zero bits in the
interleaved right half of its value. Second, it is the only entry that
contains a zero byte. That is to say, when the 32-bit entries are
separated into four sequential 8-bit values, this is the only entry
that contains an octet equal to zero. These two different "zeroes" are
each used as sentinels to indicate the end of the data. The former
zero is used when outputting the second section, and the latter
zero is used when outputting the third section.
<p>
The fact that <code>;2</code> is created with 255 elements when it
only uses 107 is due to a minor optimization, which is explained
below.
<p>
Having dispensed with sections one and two, it's time to examine
section three. This is where the actual program is. To start, let's
look at the subroutines. There are five main subroutines:
<p>
<code>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
Call <code>(1001)</code>.
<br>
<code>(24)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
Print the (bit-reversed) character in <code>.2</code>.
<br>
<code>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
Print <code>.1</code> as a decimal number.
<br>
<code>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
Output the string represented by the compressed byte in <code>.2</code>.
<br>
<code>(14)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
Call <code>(2)</code> and then call <code>(1)</code>.
<p>
Let us examine these before turning to the main program, starting with
<code>(4)</code>.
<p>
<pre>
(4)	    DO (1001) NEXT
</pre>
<p>
This one isn't really a subroutine, but it should be explained up
front. The standard technique of handling conditionals is to set
<code>.5</code> to either <code>#1</code> or <code>#2</code> and then
jump to a line which in turn jumps to <code>(1001)</code>. In this
program, however, most conditionals are handled by setting
<code>.5</code> to either <code>#2</code> or <code>#3</code>. (This is
because it usually requires fewer characters to create a
<code>#2</code> vs. <code>#3</code> value than the more traditional
<code>#1</code> vs. <code>#2</code>.) This necessitates having an
extra jump before reaching <code>(1001)</code>, which is what this
statement accomplishes.
<p>
Additionally, <code>(4)</code> is used in lieu of a
<code>RESUME</code> statement, typically by calling <code>(4)</code>
with <code>.5</code> set to <code>#3</code>. The quine actually
contains no <code>RESUME</code> statements. Instead, each subroutine
is arranged to fall through to a <code>DO (4) NEXT</code> statement.
In each case <code>.5</code> is known to have the desired value,
usually leftover from a previous test.
<p>
<pre>
(24)	    DO STASH .1
	PLEASE .1 &lt;- .4
	PLEASE .4 &lt;- .2
	    DO (1010) NEXT
	PLEASE RETRIEVE .1
	    DO ,2SUB#1 &lt;- .3~#255
	PLEASE READ OUT ,2
	    DO (4) NEXT
</pre>
<p>
<code>(24)</code> is a bare-bones character-output routine. It stores
the previous character output in <code>.4</code> so that it can
subtract the following character from it. (Thus, all output in the
program must be done through this routine.) <code>.1</code> is
frequently used in the program as a loop counter, so <code>(24)</code>
<code>STASH</code>es <code>.1</code> before performing the
subtraction. <code>,2</code> is created as an one-element tail array
&mdash; and <code>.4</code> is set to <code>#0</code> &mdash; at the
start of the program.
<p>
Note that <code>(24)</code> does not affect the value of
<code>.5</code>, so as per the comments in the previous section, the
program can only safely <code>DO (24) NEXT</code> when <code>.5</code>
is already set to <code>#3</code>.
<p>
The next subroutine, <code>(1)</code>, is our "itoa" function. This is
the central component to outputting the second section:
<p>
<pre>
(1)	PLEASE .5 &lt;- '?"!1~.1'~#1"$#2'~#6
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- #10
	    DO (4) NEXT
	    DO (1040) NEXT
	PLEASE .5 &lt;- .1
	PLEASE .1 &lt;- .3
	    DO (1030) NEXT
	    DO STASH .1
	PLEASE .1 &lt;- .5
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- .3
	    DO (1010) NEXT
	PLEASE RETRIEVE .1
	    DO STASH .3
	    DO (1) NEXT
	PLEASE RETRIEVE .3
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- .3$#3
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- !2~#15'$!2~#240'
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- !2~#15'$!2~#240'
	    DO (24) NEXT
	PLEASE RESUME #1
</pre>
<p>
This is a recursive subroutine. On each recursion, one decimal digit
is extracted from <code>.1</code> until it reaches zero. So, the first
step of the routine is to test the value of <code>.1</code>. If it is
zero, then <code>(1)</code> returns to where it was called. (Note that
this means that a value of zero is incorrectly rendered as an empty
string. But see below.)
<p>
If <code>.1</code> is non-zero, the subroutine first divides it by
ten. It then takes the the resulting quotient and multiplies it by
ten. By subtracting that product from the original number, the value
of the lowest decimal digit is isolated. This value is stored in
<code>.3</code> and <code>STASH</code>ed. Then the quotient is
<code>RETRIEVE</code>d and <code>(1)</code> is called recursively. In
this fashion the digits of the number are separated out and stored in
a stack of <code>STASH</code>ed <code>.3</code> values, lowest to
highest. When <code>.1</code> reaches zero and the recursion bottoms
out, the individual digit values are <code>RETRIEVE</code>d from
highest to lowest. The part of the subroutine after the recursion adds
48 to the digits, bit-reverses the sum, and passes the resulting value
to <code>(24)</code> to be output as an ASCII digit.
<p>
Note, by the way, that the code does not actually call
<code>(24)</code> as shown above. Instead, the <code>(1)</code>
subroutine is placed in the source file just above <code>(24)</code>
in the source file, and execution is simply allowed to fall through.
(In other words, the last two lines of the above subroutine are
fictional, added here for the sake of clarity.)
<p>
There are a couple of side effects of this subroutine which should be
mentioned here. The first one is that <code>.1</code> will always be
equal to zero by the time this subroutine returns to its caller. The
second side effect involves the value of the bottom four bits of
<code>.2</code> when the subroutine returns to its original
caller. Typically, these bits will always be equal to 12, as this is
the top half of the bit-reversed value of the ASCII digit
characters. However, in the lone case where <code>(1)</code> was
called with <code>.1</code> equal to zero, <code>.2</code> will
instead be equal to 10 (as you can see by inspecting the first two
lines of the subroutine).
<p>
The next subroutine to examine is <code>(2)</code>, the decompression
routine. This is the central component to outputting the third
section. It is also recursive; in fact, it is doubly recursive:
<p>
<pre>
(2)	PLEASE .5 &lt;- #1$!2~#1'
	    DO (20) NEXT
	    DO STASH :2
	PLEASE .5 &lt;- #1$!2~#2'
	    DO :2 &lt;- ;2SUB!2~#508'
	    DO (21) NEXT
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- :2~#65280
	    DO (2) NEXT
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- :2~#255
	PLEASE RETRIEVE :2
	    DO (2) NEXT
(20)	    DO (4) NEXT
	PLEASE .5 &lt;- #1$"!2~.2'~#1"
	    DO (10) NEXT
	    DO (24) NEXT
	    DO (1001) NEXT
(21)	    DO (4) NEXT
	    DO :2 &lt;- :2~'#65280$#65280'
	PLEASE .5 &lt;- #3
(10)	    DO (4) NEXT
	PLEASE GIVE UP
</pre>
<p>
First, the low bit of <code>.2</code> is tested. If it is zero, then
<code>.2</code> contains a valid bit-reversed ASCII character. In this
case, the subroutine jumps to <code>(20)</code>, where the character
is output, and the subroutine immediately returns to the caller.
Otherwise, <code>.2</code>'s value is an index into our compression
dictionary. The top six bits of the byte value in <code>.2</code> is
used as the index into <code>;2</code>. The second-lowest bit is used
to determine which half of <code>:2</code> to use. If this bit is
zero, then the code at <code>(21)</code> shifts the value in
<code>:2</code> down 16 bits. Then the subroutine calls itself
recursively, once for each byte value stored in <code>:2</code>. In
this way are the dictionary entries expanded to their full string
values when output.
<p>
Now, there are two important aspects to the subroutine that the above
paragraph skipped over. First, note that actually seven bits of
<code>.2</code>, not six, are used for the index into
<code>;2</code>. The compression dictionary only occupies entries 1
through 63, however; the entries beyond 63 contain the compressed
bytestream. Thus, this routine is also used to extract two bytes from
the compressed string, and output their decompressed values.
<p>
Second, note that the code under <code>(20)</code> tests if
<code>.2</code> is equal to zero before calling <code>(24)</code>.  If
so, the subroutine is diverted to the line following
<code>(10)</code>. So this means that the program can be made to end
at any time by attempting to output a zero byte.
<p>
The final subroutine, <code>(14)</code>, is very simple:
<p>
<pre>
(14)	    DO (2) NEXT
	    DO (1) NEXT
	PLEASE RESUME #1
</pre>
<p>
The effect is to output the dictionary entry corresponding to the
value in <code>.2</code>, followed by the decimal number stored in
<code>.1</code>. (But note, once again, that the code does not
actually call <code>(1)</code>. Rather the <code>(14)</code>
subroutine is placed before <code>(1)</code> in the source file, and
execution is allowed to just fall through.)
<p>
Having covered the subroutines, and the initialization of the hybrid
array, let us now turn to the main body of the program.
<p>
<pre>
	PLEASE .1 &lt;- #255
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- .1
	    DO ,2 &lt;- #1
	PLEASE .4 &lt;- #0
	    DO (14) NEXT
</pre>
<p>
The above lines complete the initialization section. The
<code>,2</code> array is created and <code>.4</code> is set to zero,
as required by the <code>(24)</code> subroutine. Both <code>.1</code>
and <code>.2</code> are set to 255 just before <code>(14)</code> is
invoked. The <code>(14)</code> routine, remember, simply calls
<code>(2)</code> and <code>(1)</code> sequentially. <code>(2)</code>
expands the value 255 in <code>.2</code> into the output string
"<tt>DO;2&lt;-#</tt>", and <code>(1)</code> outputs the value in
<code>.1</code> as the string "<tt>255</tt>". The total effect is that
the first line of the program is output. This completes the printing
of the first section.
<p>
<pre>
	PLEASE COME FROM (3)
	    DO (1020) NEXT
	    DO STASH .1
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- #155
	    DO :2 &lt;- ;2SUB.1
	    DO (14) NEXT
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- #11
	PLEASE .1 &lt;- :2~'#65535$#0'
	    DO (14) NEXT
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- #15
	PLEASE .1 &lt;- :2~'#0$#65535'
	    DO (14) NEXT
	PLEASE RETRIEVE .1
	PLEASE .5 &lt;- .2~#6
(3)	    DO (4) NEXT
</pre>
<p>
This loop outputs section two of source code, i.e. the statements that
initialize <code>;2</code>. <code>.1</code> is the loop counter,
initialally set to zero by the previous call to <code>(2)</code>, and
incremented at the start of each iteration by <code>(1020)</code>. The
body of the loop calls <code>(14)</code> three separate times. The
first time, <code>.2</code> is set to 155. <code>(2)</code> expands
155 to the string "<tt>DO;2SUB#</tt>", and <code>(1)</code> prints the
value of the loop counter. The second time, <code>.2</code> is set to
11, which expands to the string "<tt>&lt;-#</tt>", and <code>.1</code>
is set to the left-interleaved bits in <code>:2</code> (which contains
the current element of <code>;2</code>). For the third call to
<code>(14)</code>, <code>.2</code> is set to 15, which expands to the
string "<tt>$#</tt>", and <code>.1</code> gets the right-interleaved
bits of <code>:2</code>. In this fashion, a single line of source code
is reconstructed and output.
<p>
Finally, at the bottom of the loop body, two bits from <code>.2</code>
are extracted and stored in <code>.5</code> before calling
<code>(4)</code>. Recall that <code>(1)</code> leaves a value of 12 in
the bottom four bits of <code>.2</code>, and therefore <code>.5</code>
will get set to 2, thus causing <code>(4)</code> to do nothing.
Except, that is, in the case when <code>(1)</code> is called with
<code>.1</code> set to zero &mdash; in this case case, <code>.2</code>
will have a value of 10 in its bottom bits, which will put a value of 1
in <code>.5</code>. The upshot of this is that the loop will exit when
it encounters an element of <code>;2</code> whose right-interleaved
half is equal to zero. Conveniently, this is true only for final
element of <code>;2</code>.
<p>
At this point the program has completed the output of section two.
The third and final section to be output is what is encoded in the
elements of <code>;2</code>, in Re-Pair compressed form. All that
remains is to decompress and output this data. (Note, by the way, that
the first character encoded in this data is a "<tt>0</tt>" character.
This is because the final "<tt>0</tt>" character of section two hasn't
been printed out yet, because as noted above the <code>(2)</code>
routine renders a zero value as an empty string.)
<p>
<pre>
(4)	    DO (1001) NEXT
	PLEASE .1 &lt;- #255
	PLEASE COME FROM (34)
	    DO (1020) NEXT
	    DO (1020) NEXT
	PLEASE .2 &lt;- .1
(34)	    DO (2) NEXT
</pre>
<p>
In this loop, <code>.1</code> starts out equal to 255, which
corresponds to the final entry in the compression dictionary. On each
iteration <code>.1</code> is increased by two; on the first iteration
this leaves <code>.1</code> equal to 257, referring to the first two
bytes of the compression string. This value is then transferred to
<code>.2</code> and <code>(2)</code> is called. This causes two bytes
from the bytestream stored in <code>;2</code> to be extracted,
decompressed, and output. The reason for increasing by two on each
iteration is that the value passed to <code>(2)</code> must always be
odd; even values correspond to literal ASCII character values.
<p>
This loop continues until the zero bytes at the end of the data are
reached, which, as noted above, cause <code>(2)</code> to end the
program. The quine has completed the printing of the third section,
and thus the entire quine.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
For the unadulterated awfulness of it all, here is what the quine
looks like in its entirety. Line breaks have been inserted, but the
real program contains no whitespace of any kind. (Be aware that these
line breaks will prevent this code from successfully compiling. If you
want a working copy of the quine, please use the link at the top of
this page.) Note that the part of the program that was so meticulously
discussed above occupies roughly a third of the source code. The long
initial sequence of assignment statements constitute the majority of
the program.
