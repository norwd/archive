<h2>My INTERCAL Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../intercal-man/index.html">The HTML
Version of the C-INTERCAL Manual</a>
<br>
Complete and up-to-date.
<li>
<a href="intercal.txt">The Original INTERCAL Manual</a>
<br>
This text file is how the legend of INTERCAL spread to the outside
world.
<li>
<a href="whatis.html">What is INTERCAL?</a>
<br>
If you don't know what INTERCAL is, this introduction will not help
you in the slightest.
<li>
<a href="tables.html">Useful Tables</a>
<br>
(Relatively speaking.) A collection of tables relevant to writing
INTERCAL programs.
<li>
<a href="iarticle.html">Charlie Stross on INTERCAL</a>
<br>
Here is an archive of a 1992 <i>Computer Shopper</i> article on
INTERCAL. Although it contains a few glaring errors, nonetheless it is
well-written, and a rare appearance of INTERCAL in the print media.
<li>
<a href="INTERCAL-style-guide.html">The Google INTERCAL Style Guide</a>
<br>
I happened to be working at a large search-engine company when, for
April Fool's Day, they announced that all future code would be written
in INTERCAL. My contribution to this announcement was to provide a
style guide for the new language. Some of the humor is specifically
playing off of the actual style guides used internally, but I offer it
in hope that there may also be passages of interest to the general
INTERCAL programmer.
</ul>
<h2>My INTERCAL Programs</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="numio.html">"Numerical"
I/O Library</a>
<br>
This is a library of useful I/O routines, including some for doing
numerical I/O. (As in, using the Hindu-Arabic digits.)
<li>
<a href="ins/insstart.html">Intersections &amp; Splats</a>
<br>
The world's first INTERCAL CGI script. Written entirely in INTERCAL,
this script allows you to play a Mastermind-style game with your web
browser. Instructions are on the starting page.
<li>
<a href="yapp.html">Yapp</a>
<br>
An INTERCAL program that generates INTERCAL programs.
<li>
<a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/intercal/quine.html">A Quine for C-INTERCAL</a>
<br>
They said it couldn't be done. (They were wrong.) They also said it
shouldn't be done. (No comment.) In any event, here it is: an INTERCAL
program which, when executed, produces its own source code. This page
explains in detail how it manages to not be hundreds of lines long.
<li>
<a href="syslibs.html">syslib.3i
through syslib.7i</a>
<br>
Ports of the standard library for the non-binary dialects of
C-INTERCAL. All the standard library functions are supported, for each
of the bases 3 through 7.
<li>
<a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/intercal/float.html">The
Floating-Point Library</a>
<br>
The big one. The distribution for this includes a complete
floating-point library for INTERCAL, along with a Fast Fourier
Transform program, and flonck, an RPN calculator.
<li>
<a href="pgpi.html">Password Generator</a>
<br>
This is actually an essay responding to misinformation about INTERCAL,
but it also includes a small INTERCAL program for generating random
passwords.
<li>
<a href="puzzle.html">An INTERCAL Puzzle</a>
<br>
Try to figure out what the purpose of this program is.
</ul>
