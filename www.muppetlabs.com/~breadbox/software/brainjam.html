<h1>Brain Jam</h1>
</center>
</p>
<p>
Brain Jam is a solitaire card game. It is similar to soltaire games
like Freecell in that the entire deck is dealt out face up at the
start, so the player has full information. However, unlike many
solitaire programs, Brain Jam comes with a large but finite number of
initial deck orderings, all of which are guaranteed to be solvable.
Thus there is no luck factor in playing Brain Jam.
</p>
<p>
Once you have solved a given configuration, you can then go back and
work to find a new solution with fewer moves. The program includes a
sophisticated undo/redo feature that lets you explore multiple
solution paths at once.

Brain Jam runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac. See the top of the page for
the available download options:
<ul>
<li> Linux users can download and build the source, or users of
Debian-based distributions can try directly installing the package
(for 64-bit Intel systems).
<li> Windows users can download the installer, or a plain zip file.
Both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries are provided.
<li> Mac users can download and build the source, or Homebrew users
can install the formula.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In addition to the graphical interface shown here, the Linux version
also has a text-based interface available (using ncursesw).
</p>
<p>
Brain Jam comes with built-in documentation. Type "?" or F1 inside the
program to learn the rules of the game and how to play.
