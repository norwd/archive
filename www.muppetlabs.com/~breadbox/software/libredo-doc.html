<h1>Redo Library</h1>
<p>
libredo is a simple library that makes it easy to add powerful undo
and redo commands to a logic puzzle game (or similar sorts of
programs). libredo takes responsiblity for managing a branching undo
state history without needing to be tightly integrated into the
calling program.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Many such programs that provide undo and redo commands will only
remember a single linear sequence. That is, undone states will only be
redo-able while a user is using these two commands. As soon as the
user takes some other action that changes state in a new way, all
remaining undone states are forgotten. This limited functionality is
common, if not ubiquitous. In contrast, libredo provides functions
that allow a program to manage a complete history of user actions. The
program can then let the user navigate around this history.
<p>
The library assists the calling program by organizing and remembering
a complete history of visited states. When undo is used to return to a
previous state, the user can make other changes without losing
history. Then, if undo is used to return to the branch point a second
time, both sequences will be available for redoing. The user's history
is no longer linear. Instead, it takes the form of a tree, rooted at
the starting state and bifurcating.
<p>
With this history available, libredo will detect when a user returns
to a previously-seen state via a new sequence of actions. The calling
program can then notify the user that their latest path has led to
familiar territory. If this new sequence is more efficient, however,
libredo can also automate the process of promoting the new sequence
over the old one.
<p>

<h2>Candidate Programs</h2>
<p>
libredo was originally designed to be used with programs that
implement a certain class of logic puzzles. Logic puzzles typically
involve rearranging or altering elements of a well-defined system, and
there are a certain set of features that often arise:
<p>
<ul>
<li>There is a well-defined initial state, and one or more final states.
<li>There is no hidden information, which would reduce the desirability
of giving the user an undo/redo facility in the first place. (For
example, the solitaire game Klondike would not be a good candidate,
since at the start many of the cards are face down.)
<li>There is a limited and well-defined set of actions available to the
user at any given point. This is in contrast to games that depend on
the timing of user actions, since then the timing becomes a necessary
component of the action, causing the total set of actions to expand
significantly. (Such games typically don't provide undo facilities in
any case.)
<li>The complete state of the system can typically be encoded in a small
amount of space, making it feasible to maintain an unabridged move
history in memory.
<li>The main challenge to the user is to solve the puzzle &mdash; but after
that, there is usually a secondary challenge of trying to improve
one's solution, typically by solving it in fewer steps. (Thus, a logic
puzzle with only one possible solution path might not find this
library as useful, since the solver would not be expected to be doing
an extensive search of the puzzle's solution space.)
</ul>
<p>
Sokoban is a good example of a program that has all of these features.
There are only four possible actions (up, down, left, and right), and
the complete state can be encoded by recording the posible of every
moveable object. The exact size of this state would depend on the
level design, but the vast majority of Sokoban levels would need less
than 100 bytes.
<p>
Freecell is another example. All cards are face-up throughout the
game. There are 240 different actions: there are 16 places to move a
card from, and 15 places to move it to. At most points in the game,
however, there are only a dozen or so available moves. Given the
constraints of the layout, only a single byte is needed to encode a
card's location, so the complete state can be contained in 52 bytes.
On the other hand, freecell would ultimately not be a good candidate,
since its games are generally not complex enough to benefit from an
advanced undo/redo facility.
<p>
As the final point above suggests, the library is built with the
assumption that it is normal to be able to reach a given state through
many different sequences of steps, and that in such situations the
user will generally want to focus on the shortest sequence available.
In order to avoid making it too difficult to navigate a complex
solution space, the session's history is required to maintain a strict
tree structure. Two different sequences of user actions will therefore
always create two different positions in the history, even if they
both lead to the same state. To capture this equivalence, the two
positions will be linked by an attribute called the "better" pointer.
These better pointers connect equivalent positions, outside of the
tree's hierarchical structure.
<p>
<a name="2"></a>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>
A libredo session is initialized by the caller providing the initial
state, which becomes the root of the tree representing the history.
Every user action will form a branch connecting one state to the next.
<p>
To give some concrete examples, imagine a game where the user has
three possible actions, which are called A, B, and C. The user begins
by performing a sequence of actions: A, A, and B. The program records
the state for each. The session history, represented as a tree, now
contains four positions, and looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
        0. (Start)
        |_ 1. A
           |_ 2. A
              |_ 3. B</pre>
<p>
(In this diagram each position is identified by a number. Each
position is also labeled with the last action taken by the user, but
in reality the action should label the branch going to the position
from the parent. That would make for an even more confusing ASCII
diagram, however.)
<p>
Now imagine that the user undoes their last action, B, and makes a new
action, C. The history now looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
        0. (Start)
        |_ 1. A
           |_ 2. A
              |_ 3. B
              |_ 4. C</pre>
<p>
If the user then undoes this action, they would find themselves back
at position 2. At this point the program indicates to the user that
they have two redo options, either B or C. If the user decides to redo
B, they will resume the state at position 3, and can take a new action
from there.
<p>
<pre>
        0. (Start)
        |_ 1. A
           |_ 2. A
              |_ 3. B
              |  |_ 5. B
              |_ 4. C</pre>
<p>
Now, assume that the user has returned to the starting state and tried
a couple of different actions from there. The history now contains ten
positions:
<p>
<pre>
        0. (Start)
        |_ 1. A
        |  |_ 2. A
        |     |_ 3. B
        |     |  |_ 5. B
        |     |_ 4. C
        |_ 6. B
           |_ 7. C
           |_ 8. B</pre>
<p>
Now imagine that their next action, another B from position 8, happens
to take them to the same state as if they had just done A from the
starting point, i.e. position 1. In that case, when the new position
is added to the session's history, this fact will be detected and
the new position's better pointer will be set:
<p>
<pre>
        0. (Start)
        |_ 1. A
        |  |_ 2. A
        |     |_ 3. B
        |     |  |_ 5. B
        |     |_ 4. C
        |_ 6. B
           |_ 7. C
           |_ 8. B
              |_ 9. B [1]</pre>
<p>
The action still creates a new position, but one that has its better
pointer (represented in the diagram in square brackets) to point to
position 1. The program can use this to infrom the user that they have
moved into a previously explored state.
<p>
Now imagine that the user returns to the initial state and executes a
C action, and that this happens to take them to a state that is
identical to the state at position 2. This differs from the previous
example in that the new position marks a shorter path to the same
state, so the older position will have its better pointer updated,
instead:
<p>
<pre>
        0. (Start)
        |_ 1. A
        |  |_ 2. A [10]
        |     |_ 3. B
        |     |  |_ 5. B
        |     |_ 4. C
        |_ 6. B
        |  |_ 7. C
        |  |_ 8. B
        |     |_ 9. B [1]
        |_ 10. C</pre>
<p>
This is all that will happen if grafting behavior is disabled. If
grafting is enabled, however, then the library will go further, and
remove the subtree rooted at position 2 and place it under position 10
instead:
<p>
<pre>
        0. (Start)
        |_ 1. A
        |  |_ 2. A [10]
        |_ 6. B
        |  |_ 7. C
        |  |_ 8. B
        |     |_ 9. B [1]
        |_ 10. C
           |_ 3. B
           |  |_ 5. B
           |_ 4. C</pre>
<p>
The user can thus continue from the new position, with the shorter
prefix having been substituted into all of their previously explored
paths. Position 2 will remain in the history, but as a leaf node,
with its better pointer indicating its replacement.
<p>
If at some point the user reaches an endpoint, i.e. one of the
solution states, then this fact will become an attribute of the entire
solution path. Each position in a solution path knows which action
leads towards the solution. When there are multiple solutions in the
history, a position will identify the shortest solution path available
for each action.

<h2>The Redo API: Types</h2>
<p>
There two structs that are used to build the history tree. Their
fields are exposed in the redo header file, and callers are free to
examine them. Their contents should never be modified directly,
however; only via the API.
<p>
(The libredo API also declares a third struct, a <tt>redo_session</tt>, 
which is opaque to the calling program.)
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_position</b></tt></h3>
<p>
The central data structure of libredo is the <tt>redo_position</tt> struct.
Each <tt>redo_position</tt> marks a position in the user's history tree: a
state that can be reached by a specific sequence. A <tt>redo_position</tt>
provides the following fields:
<p>
<table class="table">
<tr><td><tt>redo_position&nbsp;*<b>prev</b></tt></td>
<td>This field identifies the position's "parent" in the history tree.
The initial position has a <tt>prev</tt> value of <tt>NULL</tt>; all other positions
have a valid pointer to the position preceding it in the history.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>redo_branch&nbsp;*<b>next</b></tt></td>
<td>This field points to a linked list of branches. Each branch
represents an action that leads from this position to a next one. This
value is <tt>NULL</tt> if there are no actions originating from this
position. The list is ordered by recency of usage: thus, the first
branch in the list is the branch that was most recently created
(by <tt>redo_addposition()</tt>) or accessed (by <tt>redo_getnextposition()</tt>).
The fields <tt>prev</tt> and <tt>next</tt> together create the tree structure of the
session history.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>unsigned&nbsp;short&nbsp;<b>nextcount</b></tt></td>
<td>This field gives the number of branches present in the linked list
pointed to by <tt>next</tt>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>unsigned&nbsp;short&nbsp;<b>movecount</b></tt></td>
<td>This field is the size of the path ending at this position &mdash; i.e.
the number of actions that were taken to arrive here from the starting
point.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>redo_position&nbsp;*<b>better</b></tt></td>
<td>If this field is not <tt>NULL</tt>, it points to another position in the
session history that has the same game state as this one, but in fewer
moves.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>signed&nbsp;char&nbsp;<b>endpoint</b></tt></td>
<td>This field is zero if it is possible to make further moves from this
position. Otherwise, this position is marked as a final state. It is
set by the caller via <tt>redo_addposition()</tt>. The caller can set
different values for different types of final states, in which case
the library will treat solution endpoints with higher values as being
preferable.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>signed&nbsp;char&nbsp;<b>solutionend</b></tt></td>
<td>This field is zero if there are no valid solution paths that pass
through this position. Otherwise, it holds the endpoint value assigned
to the solution's final position. If more than one solution path
passes through this position, then <tt>solutionend</tt> holds the highest of
the <tt>endpoint</tt> values.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>unsigned&nbsp;short&nbsp;<b>solutionsize</b></tt></td>
<td>This field is zero if there are no valid solution paths that pass
through this position. Otherwise, it holds the total length of the
solution path. If more than one solution path passes through this
position with the same <tt>endpoint</tt> value, then <tt>solutionsize</tt> holds the
length of the shortest such path.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_branch</b></tt></h3>
<p>
The <tt>redo_branch</tt> struct represents a branch connecting one position
to another in the history tree. Its fields are:
<p>
<table class="table">
<tr><td><tt>int&nbsp;<b>move</b></tt></td>
<td>This is the user action that labels the branch. The value of <tt>move</tt>
is not constrained by the library, other than being an integer. The
calling program is free to use whatever representation of user actions
that is convenient, as long as it is consistent.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>redo_position&nbsp;*<b>p</b></tt></td>
<td>This field holds the position that the action results in &mdash; in other
words, the branch's end point.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>redo_branch&nbsp;*<b>cdr</b></tt></td>
<td>Branches are stored in a linked list; this field either points to
the next branch in the list, or is <tt>NULL</tt> to mark the end of the list.
(The name <tt>cdr</tt> comes from the traditional Lisp function for moving
through a linked list, and was used because the more common name
"next" might have invited confusion with the field of that name in the
<tt>redo_position</tt> struct.)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<a name="4"></a>
<h2>The Redo API: Functions</h2>
<p>
The following provides a brief description of each function in the
library's API.
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_beginsession</b>()</tt></h3>
<p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_session *<b>redo_beginsession</b>(</tt></td>
<td align="left"><tt>void const *<b>initialstate</b>,</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"><tt>int <b>size</b>,</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"><tt>int <b>cmpsize</b>)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<tt>redo_beginsession()</tt> creates a new session, with an empty history.
The return value is a pointer to the session. Most of the other API
functions require this value as their first argument.
<p>
<tt>initialstate</tt> is a pointer to a buffer that contains a representation
of the starting position. This position will become the root of the
tree representing the history.
<p>
<tt>size</tt> is the number of bytes in the state representation. Every state
will be stored in the history as a buffer of this size. The library
does not examine the contents of this data, other than to compare it
with buffers representing other states. The calling program is free to
use whatever encoding is convenient, so long as it is consistent (i.e.
a given state is always encoded to the same set of bytes).
<p>
That said, <tt>cmpsize</tt> can be used to specify how many bytes of the
state data are to be used when comparing two buffers. Any bytes after
<tt>cmpsize</tt> in the state data are stored by the library, but are
otherwise ignored. If <tt>cmpsize</tt> is zero, then it is treated as being
equal to <tt>size</tt>, i.e. all bytes are significant.
<p>
(Please note that if the calling program uses this feature and stores
extra bytes in the state data, the library has no way to validate
these bytes. Thus, if grafting occurs, or if <tt>redo_duplicatepath()</tt> is
used to make copies of positions, inconsistenties can be introduced
across a solution path. Whether or not this happens is entirely
dependent on how the extra state data is being used by the calling
program, of course. For programs where this is an issue, the caller
may need to use <tt>redo_updatesavedstate()</tt> to manually fix up the extra
state data for the transferred positions.)
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_endsession</b>()</tt></h3>
<p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><tt>void <b>redo_endsession</b>(</tt></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_session *<b>session</b>)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Call <tt>redo_endsession()</tt> to close the session and deallocate all
memory associated with it.
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_getfirstposition</b>()</tt></h3>
<p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><tt>void <b>redo_getfirstposition</b>(</tt></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_session const *<b>session</b>)</tt></td>

</table>
<p>
This function returns the initial position of the session history,

<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_getsessionsize</b>()</tt></h3>
<p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>

<td align="left"><tt>void <b>redo_getsessionsize</b>(</tt></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_session const *<b>session</b>)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This function returns the number of positions currently stored in the
session.
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_addposition</b>()</tt></h3>
<p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_position *<b>redo_addposition</b>(</tt></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_session *<b>session</b>,</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_position *<b>prev</b>,</tt></td>

<td align="left"><tt>int <b>endpoint</b>,</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"><tt>int <b>checkequiv</b>)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The <tt>redo_addposition()</tt> function is how every position after the
first is added to the session history. As with most API functions, the
first argument identifies the session that is being added to.
<p>
<tt>prev</tt> identifies the position that the action is being applied to, and
<tt>move</tt> identifies the action itself. If this action has already been
made and is recorded in the history, then <tt>redo_addposition()</tt> will
simply return it directly. Otherwise, it will create a new position
and return it after adding it to the history tree.
<p>
<tt>state</tt> points to a buffer that contains the representation of the new
position's state. The library will make a copy of this data, so the
calling program is free to reuse or deallocate the buffer after
<tt>redo_addposition()</tt> returns.
<p>
A non-zero value for <tt>endpoint</tt> indicates that the new position being
created is a final state, i.e. a "solution state". In this case, the
path ending in the newly created position will be marked as being a
solution. The <tt>solutionend</tt> and <tt>solutionsize</tt> fields will be set, not
just in the returned position but in all positions along the solution
path. The caller can provide multiple non-zero values for different
endpoints, in which case solutions with higher <tt>endpoint</tt> values will
be treated as preferable. (In the case where a state leads to multiple
final states with equal <tt>endpoint</tt> values, the shorter path will be
preferred.)
<p>
The <tt>checkequiv</tt> argument controls how the library checks for
identical states in the history. It can take one of three values:
<p>
<table class="table">
<tr><td><tt>redo_nocheck</tt></td>
<td>No check is made. This setting would be used if the calling program
never examines the better pointers, or if it already knows that the
current state is unique.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>redo_check</tt></td>
<td>The library checks for other positions in the history that have
identical state data, and sets the better pointers appropriately if
so. This is the usual case.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>redo_checklater</tt></td>
<td>The position is not checked, but is marked as needing to be checked.
This check will then take place during the next call to
<tt>redo_setbetterfields()</tt>.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In the case where the check is performed: If another position is found
with the same state but a smaller move count, the position returned by
the function will have its better pointer set to the other position.
If on the other hand the position found has a larger move count, then
it will have its better pointer set instead, to point to the newly
created position. In addition, it might have its subtree of positions
grafted onto the new position, depending on the current grafting
behavior. See below for more details.
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_setgraftbehavior</b>()</tt></h3>
<p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><tt>int <b>redo_setgraftbehavior</b>(</tt></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_session *<b>session</b>,</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"><tt>int <b>grafting</b>)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<tt>redo_setgraftbehavior()</tt> determines the grafting behavior of
<tt>redo_addposition()</tt>. The return value is the setting's value at the
time the function was called.
<p>
When a position is added that has the same state as an already
existing position but with a smaller move count, there are four
possible actions that the library can take, depending on the setting:
<p>
<table class="table">
<tr><td><tt>redo_nograft</tt></td>
<td>Do nothing (beyond setting the better pointer appropriately).</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>redo_copypath</tt></td>
<td>Copy the shortest solution path in the older position's subtree over
to the new position. (If no solution path exists from the older
position, then this is the same as <tt>redo_nograft</tt>.)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>redo_graft</tt></td>
<td>Transfer the entire subtree currently rooted at the older position
over to the new position. The older position thus becomes a leaf node,
and any solutions that the subtree contains will inherit the
improvement in size. This is the default behavior setting.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>redo_graftandcopy</tt></td>
<td>Graft the subtree, as with <tt>redo_graft</tt>, but then copy the shortest
solution back to the older position, so that it is not left as a leaf
node. (If no solution path exists in the grafted subtree, then this
behavior is the same as <tt>redo_graft</tt>.)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_getsavedstate</b>()</tt></h3>
<p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><tt>void const *<b>redo_getsavedstate</b>(</tt></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_position const *<b>position</b>)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This function returns a pointer to the session's copy of the state
data for the given position. As with the other data associated with a
position, the contents of this buffer should not be modified by the
caller. (That said, see <tt>redo_updateextrastate()</tt> below.)
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_getnextposition</b>()</tt></h3>
<p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_position *<b>redo_getnextposition</b>(</tt></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_position const *<b>position</b>,</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"><tt>int <b>move</b>)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<tt>redo_getnextposition()</tt> traverses a branch in the history tree,
starting from <tt>position</tt> and following the branch labeled with
<tt>move</tt> to another position, which is returned. <tt>NULL</tt> is returned if
there is no branch labeled with <tt>move</tt> at <tt>position</tt>.
<p>
This function also has the effect of causing the requested branch to
be moved to the front of the linked list (in the parent position).
Thus this function keeps the linked list of branches in order of the
most recently accessed.
<p>
<h3><tt><b>redo_dropposition</b>()</tt></h3>
<p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_position *<b>redo_dropposition</b>(</tt></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_session *<b>session</b>,</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"><tt>redo_position *<b>position</b>)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This function deletes <tt>position</tt> from the session's history. In order
for a position to be removed from the history, it must not have any
branches to other positions. The return value is the position's parent
if the deletion was successful. If the deletion was unsuccessful,
<tt>position</tt> is returned, unchanged, instead.

This function modifies the "extra" state data stored for a position &mdash; i.e. the non-comparing bytes of state data. (Thus, if
<tt>redo_beginsession()</tt> was called without a lower value for <tt>cmpsize</tt>,
this function will have no effect.) The <tt>state</tt> argument should point
to a buffer of complete state data, the same as would be passed to
<tt>redo_addposition()</tt>, but only the excess bytes will be copied into
the position's state data.

<p>
This function acts on every position in the session that was added
with <tt>redo_checklater</tt> as the final argument to <tt>redo_addposition()</tt>.
Every such position has its better pointer correctly initialized, as
would have been done if <tt>redo_addposition()</tt> had been called with
<tt>redo_check</tt>. Note however that no grafting will occur: this function
does not change the history tree, or anything other than the better
pointers.
<p>
The intended use case for <tt>redo_setbetterfields()</tt> is for recreating a
session's history tree from scratch, as e.g. from a save file. Without
the ability to delay this step, a new session would have to create
positions in the same order that they were created originally, in
order to get the same network of better pointers. The alternative
would be for the program to record all better pointers, and then
recreate them directly.
<p>
With this feature, the code that saves the session history can simply
record a flag indicating which positions have non-<tt>NULL</tt> better
pointers. Then, the code that recreates the history from the saved
data can use this flag to decide whether to call <tt>redo_addposition()</tt>
with <tt>redo_nocheck</tt> or <tt>redo_checklater</tt>. And then
<tt>redo_setbetterfields()</tt> is called once after the full history is
present in the session.

<p>
<tt>redo_suppresscycle()</tt> looks for matching states along a path. It is
similar to what <tt>redo_addposition()</tt> does when checking for
pre-existing identical state, except that it is constrained to only
examine the positions along a single path.
<p>
The typical use case for this function is to call it just before
calling <tt>redo_addposition()</tt>, to guard against creating a "loop" via
the better pointers. (This situation is not forbidden by the library,
but may be unwanted by the calling program for various reasons.)
<p>
The <tt>pposition</tt> argument is the address of the position that marks the
end of the path to be examined. <tt>state</tt> points to a buffer that
contains the state data for the as-yet uncreated position. (In
practical terms, <tt>pposition</tt> and <tt>state</tt> correspond to the <tt>prev</tt> and
<tt>state</tt> arguments that will be passed to <tt>redo_addposition()</tt>.)
<p>
If a matching state is found among the given position's ancestors,
then the position pointed to by <tt>pposition</tt> will be overwritten to
point to the position with the matching state, and the return value
will be true. A return value of false indicates that no matching state
was found.
<p>
The <tt>prunelimit</tt> argument specifies a distance limit. If this argument
is positive, then when a matching state is found among the ancestors
inside that limit, the intervening positions will be automatically
deleted, as per <tt>redo_dropposition()</tt>. This deletion takes place
starting at the endmost position and going upwards, so if a position
is encountered that has other branches, no further deletions will take
place.

<p>
This function copies a solution path, starting at <tt>source</tt> and going
forward to an endpoint, over to <tt>dest</tt>. The two positions should have
identical states, thus typically <tt>dest</tt> is simply the better pointer
of the <tt>source</tt> position. If there is more than one solution path that
passes through <tt>source</tt>, the path with the smallest solution size is
selected.
<p>
The return value is true if the copy was completed successfully. If
<tt>source</tt> is not part of a solution path, then nothing is copied and
false is returned.
<p>
This function calls <tt>redo_addposition()</tt> internally to copy the
positions, therefore it is not an error if some (or all) of the
positions being copied are already present at <tt>dest</tt>.

This function returns true if the session history has been modified
since the session was created, or since the last call to
<tt>redo_clearsessionchanged()</tt>.

<p>
This function resets the session's change flag, so that subsequent
calls to <tt>redo_hassessionchanged()</tt> will return false until the
session is changed again. The return value is the value of the change
flag at the time the function was called.
