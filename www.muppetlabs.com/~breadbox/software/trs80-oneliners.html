<h1>One-Liners for TRS-80 Basic</h1>
</center>
</p>
<p>
This program is a collection of one-liners written by various authors
for the TRS-80 Model I/III. That is, each sub-program in this program
originally started out as a one-line program. They have been collected
together into a single program so that you can experience them all for
yourself without having to load each one up separately.
</p>
<p>
There are a total of 14 different one-liners. Most one-liners run in
infinite (or near-infinite) loops. A few of the programs originally
exited to the <tt>READY</tt> prompt; those are handled here by letting
them fall into infinite loops inserted between one-liners. At any
time, you can hit Shift-Clear to leave a one-liner and return to the
initial menu. To exit the program, press Enter at the initial menu
&mdash; i.e. without providing any input.
</p>
<p>
Note: it is recommended that you do not exit the program simply by
pressing Break. If this does happen, you should press Shift-Clear and
then Enter to exit cleanly before returning to the DOS or loading a
new Basic program. Otherwise, sooner or later the machine will
probably hang.
</p>
<p>
All the one-liners, except for the last two, were originally published
in Softside magazine between 1980 and 1982. They typically appeared as
filler material, occupying the space of a small advertisement. My
high-school computer programming teacher had a small hoard of various
TRS-80 magazines, including numerous Softsides, and this is how I
first became acquainted with the challenge of writing one-liners. I
immediately fell in love with the idea. (After all, the one-liner
mindset was little more than my normal programming mindset, back then,
taken to its logical conclusion.) I carefully paged through all of my
teacher's Softsides in order to find all the TRS-80 one-liners.
Inevitably I eventually decided that I needed to collect them all
together into a single program.
</p>
<p>
In order to provide a way to access each one-liner as a separate
program, I needed to add two things: a way for the user to select
which one-liner to run, and a way to cleanly exit a one-liner without
using Break, which would exit the whole program.
</p>
<p>
The former problem was solved with a simple one-liner, line 1 of the
program. All it does is reset some of the shared state of the Basic
interpreter and then displays a prompt. It is notable only for the
fact that the prompt is tailored to remind users of the opening prompt
of the Scott Adams Adventure Collections.
</p>
<p>
The latter problem was a bit trickier, and I eventually solved it by
writing a short assembly-language routine to hook into the keyboard
handler. The hook code simply looks for the Shift-Clear key
combination, and when it sees it it forces the Basic interpreter to
jump back to line 1 of the program. Providing and installing the
machine-language code is done in line 0 of the program. The
machine-language bytes are embedded in a <tt>REM</tt> statement. I
didn't want to use the standard <tt>USR</tt> interface for invoking
the code, however, out of concern that it might somehow interfere with
a future one-liner, so instead I hijacked the little-used
<tt>NAME</tt> command. If you're curious to understand how it works,
I've included a detailed explanation at the end of the page.
</p>
<p>
(I also had to edit the originals slightly, since almost all of them
were originally written to be either line 0 or line 1. Generally this
was a trivial change, although some of the one-liners that got
assigned to lines 10 and above are now a little big larger than they
originally were.)
</p>

The following is a listing, or really a representation of the listing,
of the complete program. It is provided for reference only; it's much
less effort to use the provided link at the top of the page to obtain
a usable copy of the program. Manually entering one-liners is often
not a straightforward matter: The interpreter won't accept the full
255 bytes at the prompt, so occasionally one has to omit the last few
characters when entering a line, and then append the remainder via the
<tt>EDIT</tt> command after the interpreter has had a chance to
parse the input. (<tt>EDIT</tt> is also used to embed line
breaks and other special characters in string literals.) And of
course, the bytes of the machine-language routine in line 0 has
to be created by entering filler characters and then modifying
them afterwards via <tt>POKE</tt>.

<h3>Appendix: How Line 0 Works</h3>
</center>
</p>
<p>
The Basic part of line 0 is straightforward. The first
statement:
<blockquote>
<pre>B=PEEK(16548)+256*PEEK(16549)+124</pre>
</blockquote>
initializes <tt>B</tt> with the address of the Basic program,
plus 124 bytes, which is the offset of the machine-language
routine within the <tt>REM</tt>. Next comes a short loop:
<blockquote>
<pre>FORX=0TO2:POKEB+79+X*2,PEEK(16782+X):NEXT</pre>
</blockquote>
which copies the existing <tt>NAME</tt> vector to a safe place
inside the machine-language routines (in the bytes containing
question marks below). Once these bytes have been saved, the
program can then replace them:
<blockquote>
<pre>POKE16782,195:POKE16783,BAND255:POKE16784,B/256</pre>
</blockquote>
with a vector that jumps to the machine-language routine. With
this in place, the Basic program can then use the statement:
<blockquote>
<pre>NAME</pre>
</blockquote>
to jump to the machine-language routine.
</p>
<p>
The machine-language code, besides being necessary to hook
the keyboard, also allows much more functionality to be packed
into a small number of bytes. Turning to the original assembly,
the machine language routine at offset 124 (007CH) from the
start of the Basic program is as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>                ; The hook installer routine
007C  DD2AA440  SETUP:  LD      IX,(40A4H)      ; IX=line 0 pos
0080  119D01            LD      DE,0100H+HOOK   ; DE=offset of
0083  15                DEC     D               ;   hook rtn
0084  DD19              ADD     IX,DE           ; advance IX
0086  ED4B1640          LD      BC,(4016H)      ; BC=keybd rtn
008A  DD7101            LD      (IX+1),C        ; store in CALL
008D  DD7002            LD      (IX+2),B        ;   instruction
0090  DD221640          LD      (4016H),IX      ; replace w/IX
0094  1E19              LD      E,REMOVE-HOOK   ; change NAME
0096  DD19              ADD     IX,DE           ;   vector to
0098  DD228F41          LD      (418FH),IX      ;   remove rtn
009C  C9                RET                     ; setup is done
</pre>
</blockquote>
4016H contains the address of the current keyboard handling
routine. The <tt>SETUP</tt> routine retrieves that address and
stores it inside the <tt>HOOK</tt> routine, which immediately
follows this one. It then replaces that value with the address
of the start of the <tt>HOOK</tt> routine, thus installing the
keyboard hook. It also modifies the value of the <tt>NAME</tt>
vector, so that instead of pointing to this routine, it will
point to <tt>REMOVE</tt> (described below). After this, a
subsequent <tt>NAME</tt> statement will call <tt>REMOVE</tt>
instead of <tt>SETUP</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The keyboard hook routine is as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>                ; The keyboard hook
009D  CD3F3F    HOOK:   CALL    3F3FH           ; keybd handler
00A0  FE1F              CP      31              ; Clear key?
00A2  C0                RET     NZ              ; no, let pass
00A3  3A8038            LD      A,(3880H)       ; a shift key
00A6  B7                OR      A               ;   pressed?
00A7  3E1F              LD      A,31            ; (restore acc)
00A9  C8                RET     Z               ; no, let pass
00AA  E1                POP     HL              ; yes, grab it
00AB  2AA440            LD      HL,(40A4H)      ; HL=line 0 pos
00AE  01D801            LD      BC,0100H+NEXT   ; advance HL to
00B1  05                DEC     B               ;   next line
00B2  09                ADD     HL,BC           ;   of program
00B3  C31E1D            JP      1D1EH           ; back to Basic
</pre>
</blockquote>
The address of the original keyboard routine is stored as part
of the <tt>CALL</tt> instruction at top, replacing the original
value of 3F3FH (or "??" in ASCII). Thus the hook routine first
invokes the normal keyboard handler. When it returns, the
accumulator holds the decoded character. ASCII 31 represents the
Clear key, so if the accumulator holds some other value, the
routine returns directly. Otherwise the byte at 3880H is
examined, and if it is nonzero then a Shift key is currently
down. If so, the <tt>HL</tt> register is altered to point to the
second line of the current Basic program, and the hook routine
jumps directly back to the Basic interpreter instead of
returning.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the <tt>REMOVE</tt> routine, invoked when a second
<tt>NAME</tt> statement is encountered, is as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>                ; The hook uninstaller routine
00B6  DD2AA440  REMOVE: LD      IX,(40A4H)      ; IX=line 0 pos
00BA  119D01            LD      DE,0100H+HOOK   ; DE=offset of
00BD  15                DEC     D               ;   hook rtn
00BE  DD19              ADD     IX,DE           ; advance IX
00C0  DD5E01            LD      E,(IX+1)        ; get original
00C3  DD5602            LD      D,(IX+2)        ;   keybd rtn
00C6  ED531640          LD      (4016H),DE      ; restore it
00CA  3E3F              LD      A,'?'           ; restore the
00CC  1E3F              LD      E,'?'           ;   original
00CE  163F              LD      D,'?'           ;   NAME vector
00D0  328E41            LD      (418EH),A       ;   put here by
00D3  ED538F41          LD      (418FH),DE      ;   Basic prog
00D7  C9                RET                     ; we're done
                NEXT:
</pre>
</blockquote>
This routine simply restores the values that 4016H and 418EH
originally had. The original value for 4016H is stored as part
of the <tt>CALL</tt> instruction at the top of the <tt>HOOK</tt>
routine, while the origianl vector value for 418EH was stored
inside this routine directly, replacing the ASCII question mark
bytes, as part of the <tt>SETUP</tt> routine. This routine is
invoked in line 1 of the Basic program, in the case when the
user inputs an empty string, just before the final <tt>END</tt>
statement.
