<h1>
Branching Undo and Redo
</h1>
</center>
<p>
libredo is a simple library that makes it easy to add powerful undo
and redo commands to a logic puzzle game (or similar type of program).
Many such programs that provide undo and redo commands will remember
undone states only while a user is using these two commands. Once the
user uses some other command that changes state in a new way, all of
the undone states are forgotten. This limited functionality is common,
if not ubiquitous. I would like to see more programs offer something
better: that is what this library is provided for.
</p>
<p>
libredo makes it easy for a program to manage a complete history of
user actions. The program can then allow the user to navigate around this
history, to notify them when they move into already-explored
territory, and to automatically detect when existing sub-sequences
have been improved upon.
</p>
<p>
libredo comes with complete documentation of its API, which you can
read here:
</p>
<blockquote>

>API documentation</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition, the distribution includes a sample program that
demonstrates all of the major features of the library as part of a
simple (curses-based) sokoban program.
</p>
<p>
You can also see a demonstration of libredo in my implementation
of <a href="brainjam.html">Brain Jam</a>. This solitaire game uses
libredo to track a full history for every game. This capability
encourages the player to improve their solutions by searching for
new solutions with fewer moves.
</p>

At this time, libredo is distributed under version 2 of the GNU
General Public License. Questions, bug reports, and feedback in
general all should be directed to

</p>
<p>
If you use this library in your own projects, let me know.
Alternately, if you wanted to use this library in your own project but
can't for some reason, also let me know. I'm looking for other
perspectives on how this functionality can be provided.
