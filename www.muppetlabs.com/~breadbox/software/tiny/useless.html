<h1>Other Teensy Programs</h1>
<p>
The programs listed here are provided as exhibitions of just how
compressed a Linux ELF executable can be and still perform a function.
All of them abuse the kernel's casual approach to validating ELF files
in order to reduce size. The assembler source code of each of these
programs includes details showing how the ELF header, the program
segment header table, and the x86 instructions of the actual program
overlap each other.
</p>
<p>
In order to use one of these programs, you can download the assembler
source and build it with <a href="http://www.nasm.us">nasm</a>. If you
don't want to install nasm, and you have reason to believe that I can
be trusted, you can download a pre-built binary and run it directly.
(Note that you will need to use chmod +x to mark a downloaded binary
as executable.)

<a href="true">true binary</a>
<br/>
45 bytes
</p>
<p>
Despite the name, this program provides binaries for both true and
false. It returns an exit code of either zero or one, depending on
whether it is invoked with the name "true" or "false", respectively.
At 45 bytes, this program is the smallest it is possible for a Linux
ELF executable to be.

Here's a program that I've actually used. It simply runs forever,
printing a bell character every four minutes or so. When I used it, I
would leave it running in the background after logging into a remote
machine that times out connections when they're idle. One can then
disable the terminal's bell to make the character completely
invisible. Admittedly, it's a bit longer than the one-line shell
script I originally used, but on the plus side it doesn't take up an
extra process in order to sleep.

<a href="hello.asm.txt">hello.asm source</a>
<br/>
<a href="hello">hello binary</a>
<br/>
62 bytes
</p>
<p>
Here is the program that started me off on this whole pursuit: hello
world. It is dense. With the program header table overlaid on top of
the ELF header, and program itself running through both of them, some
of the bytes have no less than three different purposes.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kikx/20061111">Here</a> you can find an
even smaller hello-world program, apparently written by someone named
Kikuyan (&#x83CA;&#x3084;&#x3093;). It is only 58 bytes long, and
would have been 57 if the author had used the same version of the
greeting as myself. The program uses the technique of loading to
absolute address zero, which permits a number of tricks that further
reduce code size. I have not used this technique myself, because
current versions of Linux do not, by default, permit executables to
use a load address of zero. It is an ingenious little program, though.

<a href="hello-x64.asm.txt">hello-x64.asm source</a>
<br/>
<a href="hello-x64">hello-x64 binary</a>
<br/>
85 bytes
</p>
<p>
And, for the record, here's a hello-world program for 64-bit ELF. It's
quite a bit larger than the 32-bit version, but nonetheless I find it
surprising that it's only five bytes larger than the smallest 64-bit
ELF executable. As with that program, I credit Oleg Finkelshteyn for
showing me the overlapping technique that it uses. In many ways, it is
reminiscient of Kikuyan's program, in that because the assembly
program starts at the very top, it becomes thoroughly interwoven with
both ELF headers.

<a href="echo.asm.txt">echo.asm source</a>
<br/>
<a href="echo">echo binary</a>
<br/>
76 bytes
</p>
<p>
While echo is actually a very useful and important utility, nobody
really needs a standalone binary of echo these days, so it still
belongs on this page. This was inspired by a couple of blog posts
written by <a href="https://blog.mandejan.nl">Jan Halsema</a> about
their own attempts to use assembly to create a teensy version of echo.
It's a good example of how the choice of algorithm has as much to do
with size optimization as abusing the ELF standard. This program works
by calling write() once per character &mdash; a terribly inefficient
design choice that does wonders for its overall size.

<a href="bf.asm.txt">bf.asm source</a>
<br/>
<a href="bf">bf binary</a>
<br/>
166 bytes

Brainfuck is a very simplistic programming language, which was
invented by Urban M&uuml;ller solely for the purpose of being able to
create a compiler that was less than 256 bytes in size, for the Amiga
OS. (A description of the language can be found at
<a href="../../bf/index.html">my Brainfuck
page</a>, among many other places.) I decided to take up the challenge
as well, and created a Brainfuck compiler for Linux using less than
256 bytes. The compiler works as a filter: redirect the source code to
the compiler's input and the compiler's output to a file. (And don't
forget to chmod +x the output file.) At the beginning I didn't expect
that I would actually succeed, since I thought I would need almost
half of that just for the headers. I think my first cut was 458 bytes
in size. I was quite pleased with myself when I trimmed that down to
less than 300 bytes, ecstatic when I finally reached the 255-byte
goal, and downright triumphant when I later got it to work in 238
bytes. By the time I had a 198-byte version, I had to admit that I had
no idea where it was going to end. It's now at 166 bytes. And though I
can't quite believe it, it works just as well as the first one did. As
useless as it is, I think this one would have to be the crown jewel of
my collection. It is quite possibly also the ugliest and most opaque
program I have ever written.
