<h1>Useful Teensy Programs</h1>
<p>
The programs listed here are provided as exhibitions of just how
compressed a Linux ELF executable can be and still accomplish
something useful. Because they are potentially useful, they all adhere
to the ELF specification (though most of them still bypass libc in
favor of making direct system calls).
</p>
<p>
In order to use one of these programs, you can download the assembler
source and build it with <a href="http://www.nasm.us">nasm</a>. If you
don't want to install nasm, and you have reason to believe that I can
be trusted, you can download a pre-built binary and run it directly.
(Note that you will need to use chmod +x to mark a downloaded binary
as executable.)

Admittedly, this program is trivial, no more than a variant on
hello-world. Yet the fact is that I use this program almost daily. It
just clears the terminal screen, in the process also clearing any odd
persistent state such as reverse video. It's both shorter to type than
"clear" and faster than "reset". (For some reason the standard reset
utility takes a full second to complete.) Admittedly this program
assumes an ANSI-compatible terminal without testing for same, or even
if stdout is connected to a terminal, but I have yet to find such
shortcuts to be problematic. The name "cls", short for "clear screen",
is deeply embedded in my muscle memory, thanks to the TRS-80 and MS-DOS
both using it, and I find myself typing it habitually.

This is your classic hexdump program. I wrote it one day in a fit of
pique, after trying (and failing) to convince the standard Linux
programs to output bytes in the formatting style that I've been
accustomed to since before reaching my majority. (I've since stopped
using this program, as the default output of xxd(1) is nearly
identical.) My original version simply read from standard input, but I
quickly found this irritating enough that I sacrificed a few more
bytes in order to allow it to accept a filename on the command line.

256 bytes
</p>
<p>
This is a simple base64 decoder utility. Like hexdump, it can either
accept a filename on the command line, or work on standard input.
Since sometimes very large files are encoded in base64, I allowed the
program to be slightly larger than strictly necessary in order to
optimize for speed. This version is actually noticeably faster than
the utility included in GNU coreutils for 32-bit Linux.

This utility was my attempt to tackle an important yet complex tool.
ls is one of those programs that you really can't do without, in part
because its functionality has almost no overlap with other standard
tools, but also because it's tailored to provide multiple pieces of
information at a glance. My version is missing a few standard
features, such as sorting, but it does recognize many commonly-used
command-line options, such as <tt>-l</tt>, <tt>-a</tt>, <tt>-F</tt>,
and <tt>-R</tt>. The "long" output format only displays numeric user
IDs, timestamps are displayed as ages instead of actual times, and the
columnar output is not particularly clever. But beyond these things,
it conforms pretty closely to the standard ls program we all know and
love.

<a href="factor">factor binary</a>
<br/>
1020 bytes
</p>
<p>
This is an implementation of the standard Unix utility. It displays
the prime factors of the integers provided on the command line, or on
standard input if no arguments are given. Instead of simply trying to
achieve the smallest possible size, I decided to shoot for real
portability with this program, for a change. It not only conforms to
the requirements of the ELF specification, it also avoids making
direct system calls and instead dynamically links with libc. It should
continue to work with any future version of Linux, as long as new
versions of the libc ABI and the ELF specification remain
backwards-compatible. It also includes online help, version
information, and error messages, and therefore arguably stands as a
completely functional replacement for the standard utility in GNU
coreutils. Because factoring huge prime numbers can sometimes run for
a long time, I attempted to optimize for speed and size both. This
program makes significant use of the FPU in order to increase
parallelization in the inner loop. (Back when I first wrote it, it was
significantly faster than the standard GNU program. Since then, the
coreutils program has been updated with some advanced mathematics, and
it's now the faster program.)

By now you may be thinking: "These program are technically useful, I
suppose, but isn't there anything <em>interesting</em> in here?" Well,
how about a game? This is an implementation of Snake, a classic
computer game &mdash; in fact it's so old that you can hardly find it
anymore in its original form. I originally wrote this as an Easter Egg
for a contract involving text-terminal interfaces. Now it's available
to all as a tiny program. In case you've never played it, the object
of the game is to guide your snake around the playing field, eating
the food blocks that appear at random locations, and dodging the walls
and your own tail. As you eat the blocks, your score increases but so
does your length. The program is hard-coded to work on a Linux console
running in Latin1 mode, and thus is unlikely to behave well on modern
terminal programs. However, its small size makes it the perfect
addition to a rescue disk! After all, when you've just lost all your
data, what's better than a game to distract you from your troubles?
(By the way, my personal all-time high score is 478. Can you beat
that?)

The final program in this list is a game. And not just a game, but one
that runs under X. You've probably seen the 15 sliding-tile puzzle at
some point in your life. Some of you may even remember the program
that came with the original 1984 Macintosh operating system. But are
you aware that, in order to justify including the puzzle in the
limited memory and disk space available, the author squeezed its size
down to under 600 bytes?
(See <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Puzzle.txt"
>here</a> for the details.) Alas, while I would have loved to be able
to present a Linux binary that matched that size, the complexities of
interfacing with an X server and mimicking the details of the original
put it well over that target. I'm still working to reduce it further,
but for now here's my hefty rendition. It uses the same graphics as
the original, which unfortunately means that the window is only
slightly larger that its own title bar on a modern display. But it is
a faithful recreation of the original Macintosh program that runs
under X Windows. And despite all of my hedging about its bloat, I'd
wager that it's the only X program you've ever seen under 1k.
<p>
(Usage note: This program does not go through normal channels to find
the X server; it assumes that your X server is running locally and
that you are the only (or at least the first) user. If the program
nevertheless fails immediately when run, you may need to give yourself
permission to start X programs directly. This can be done by
running <tt>xhost si:localuser:$USER</tt>. Afterwards, you can repeat
the command with a prepended minus sign to remove these
permissions: <tt>xhost -si:localuser:$USER</tt>.)
