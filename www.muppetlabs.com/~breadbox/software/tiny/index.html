<h1>The Teensy Files</h1>
<p>
This page is a complete guide to everything I've written about
creating teensy ELF executable for Linux.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at your /bin directory: how big is the smallest ELF
executable in there? Try writing the smallest hello-world program you
can. Can you get it under, say, 1K? This is precisely what I set out
to do one day, and I ended up with a minor obsession over creating the
smallest possible executables.
</p>
<p>
How does one go about making a Linux ELF executable small? You're
about to find out.

<ul>
<li>
Part I: <a href="teensy.html">A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really
Teensy ELF Exeuctables for Linux</a>
<br/>
This is the original essay. Start here.
</li>
<li>
Intermission: <a href="teensyps.html">Some Final Breezes (a
postscript)</a>
<br/>
A handful of updates and errata.

<li>
Part II: <a href="revisit.html">The Teensy Executable Revisited</a>
<br/>
A sequel to the original, in which a slightly different path is
carefully explored.
</li>
<li>
Part III: <a href="somewhat.html">A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating
Somewhat Teensy ELF Exeuctables for Linux</a>
