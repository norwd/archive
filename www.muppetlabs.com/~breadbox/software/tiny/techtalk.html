<h1>The Teensy ELF Executable</h1>
<p>
This is a recording of a tech talk that I presented in 2014 at
<a href="http://seagl.org">SeaGL</a>, the annual Seattle GNU/Linux
conference. The talk is essentially an in-person presentation of
<a href="teensy.html">the original "Whirlwind" essay</a>, along with
some sneak peeks at the later material in the final third. Instead of
displaying slides or static images, I simply projected my terminal
session and typed as I spoke.

I wasn't set up to do a video recording during my talk, so instead I
did the next best thing: I recorded the audio using a portable
recorder, and then I ran script(1) on my console to capture the
presentation. Afterwards, I made a video recording of a terminal
replaying the session, and combined that with the audio recording.
(Although I had to do some jiggering to get the two synchronized.)
This does mean that there are some stretches in the video where
nothing visible is happening, though.

The full list of programs used: script, scriptreplay, recordmydesktop,
audacity, pitivi, and ffmpeg.
