<center><b>Games for the Linux Console</b></center>
<p>
The programs in this distribution are re-implementations of games for
the Linux console. Included please find three games:
<p>
<ul>
<li>cblocks -- sliding-block puzzles
<li>cmines -- minesweeper
<li>csokoban -- sokoban
</ul>
<p>
The games make use of the Linux console font and mouse support to
improve the user interface.

<center><b>Why Yet Another Version of Sokoban?</b></center>
<p>
One day I was playing Xsokoban when it struck me that this game
clearly was originally created for a text terminal. Curious, I did
some hunting around, and finally found one curses-based implementation
of sokoban, a Linux 1.x port from Minix code (which in turn had been
ported at least once before). I realized that the X version of the
game had completely eclipsed its origins at the terminal.
<p>
I'm not a big fan of GUIs for the sake of graphics. Pretty pictures
are nice, but text mode is where I spend most of my time. And the
Linux console has many extremely advanced features for a text
terminal, yet I just don't see many programs taking advantage of them.
I decided to rewrite some of my favorite games for the Linux console,
so I could play them, pretty pictures and all, without having to fire
up X.
<p>

General Public License. Share and Enjoy. Contact
