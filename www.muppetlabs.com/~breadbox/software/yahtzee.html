<h1>A Simple Game with Multiple UIs</h1>
</center>
</p>
<p>
Yahtzee itself is a very simple dice game, and needs no introduction.
I wrote this program as a way to experiment with different ways to
implement multiple user interfaces on top of game logic.
</p>
<p>
This program comes with three separate interfaces:
<ul>
<li>
The graphical user interface is implemented using
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> (plus
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/">SDL_ttf</a>). It
should be portable to just about any platform that SDL supports.
</li>
<li>
There is also a text-based user interface that is implemented using
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/">ncurses</a>. This
interface should work on just about any modern Unix system that
provides a curses library.
</li>
<li>
Finally, there is a pure text interface that just uses the standard
input and output, and should work anywhere, on any kind of
text-capable terminal.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Which interface to use is partly determined at runtime, depending on
the current environment. You can also choose to leave out the SDL
interface and/or the curses-based interface at compile-time. (The dumb
text interface is always included, since it is very small and incurs
no external dependencies.)
</p>
<p>
The three interfaces have different behaviors, and each one is suited
to the particulars of its capabilities. The graphical user interface,
for example, reacts appropriately to mouse-over events, as well as
mouse clicks and dragging. The curses interface is a little more
coarse-grained, in that every input event (i.e. keystroke) corresponds
to a user action. The plain-text interface is even more
coarse-grained, since a single input event can correspond to multiple
user actions (from the point of view of the game logic). Other issues
such as displaying help at run-time are also handled in a distinct way
for each interface.
</p>
<p>
My other goal in writing this program was to experiment with creating
the elements of a comfortable graphical interface. SDL does not
provide its users with access to any of a given platform's native GUI
elements (such as menus or pushbuttons), and indeed using such things
typically requires that a program be designed to accommodate the
platform's specific event-driven model &mdash; all of which interferes
with the goal of keeping the user interface in its own separate black
box.
</p>
<p>
The game logic code is aware of the various interface elements, since
its whole purpose is to update the game state in reaction to the
various user actions. But the user interface code is free to provide
other "actions" that don't alter the game state but are needed to make
a good user experience &mdash; such as rendering the pushbutton as
depressed when the mouse button is down and not yet released, or
having the score sheet elements display helpful information on
mouse-over.
</p>
<p>
Some people may also find interesting the code that creates the images
of the die faces at runtime, using some basic floating-point math.
