Tile World makes use of a number of files besides the data files of
Chip's Challenge itself. This document collects information on all of
these files in one place.

<h3>
The Configuration File
</h3>
<p>
Configuration files are used to override some of the settings in a
data file, or to set values not provided for by the data file format.
Configuration files are by convention named with a <tt>.dac</tt> extension. A
configuration file is stored in the level set directory in the place
of the data file; the latter then is placed in the data directory.
<p>
The configuration file is a simple text file. The first line of a
configuration file <i>must</i> have the following form:
<p>
<tt>file = </tt><i>DATAFILE</i>
<p>
where <i>DATAFILE</i> is the filename of the data file. (Arbitrary
whitespace is permitted around the equal sign, but there cannot be any
whitespace embedded at the beginning of the line.)
<p>
After this initial line, the configuration file can contain any of the
following lines:
<p>
<tt>usepasswords = </tt><i>y|n</i>
<p>
This line permits password-checking to be enabled/disabled when
playing the levels in the set. The default is <tt>y</tt>.
<p>
<tt>messages =</tt><i>TEXTFILE</i>
<p>
This line allows for the addition of short textual messages to be
displayed in between levels during the game. <i>TEXTFILE</i> names a
messages file placed in the data directory. See <a href="tworldff.html#1">The Messages File</a>
for more information about this file.
<p>
<tt>ruleset = </tt><i>ms|lynx</i>
<p>
This line allows the configuration file to override the ruleset
setting in the data file. This is mainly useful in the case where one
level set is playable under either ruleset (as is the case with the
original level set). The author can then provide one data file and two
configuration files to make both versions available.
<p>
<tt>lastlevel = </tt><i>levelnum</i>
<p>
This line marks an arbitrary level as being the last level in the
set. The game will stop when this level is completed, instead of
proceeding to the next level. (Note that if the data file contains any
levels beyond this one, they will only be reachable via a password.)
<p>
<tt>fixlynx = </tt><i>y|n</i>
<p>
This line is specifically for use with the original level set. It is
not generally useful, and is described here only for completeness. The
<tt>chips.dat</tt> file that MS distributed with their version of "Chip's
Challenge" contained a few minor differences from the original level
set as appeared on the Lynx. A positive value for this entry instructs
the program to undo those changes, so that the original Lynx level set
is obtained. (The changes made in the MS version were: an extra level
was added; four passwords were garbled; and four or five levels' maps
had minor alterations.)

<h3>
The Messages File
</h3>
<p>
A messages file is a plain text file that contains (usually short)
paragraphs of text that are meant to be displayed in between levels.
The original game displayed messages after every ten levels (thus they
are sometimes referred to as "decade messaegs"). These messages were
not stored in the data file, however, so a separate file must be used
to define them.
<p>
Each message text is a sequence of paragraphs, with paragraphs
separated from each other by a blank line. Line breaks within a
paragraph are converted to spaces, and when the text is actually
displayed to the user, it will be wrapped to fit the display. (To
embed an actual line break within a text, end a line with two spaces
before the line break.) A given message can contain any number of
paragraphs.
<p>
Each message text should be preceded by a line of the form
<p>
<tt>[</tt><i>N</i><tt>]</tt>
<p>
which associates the following paragraphs with that level number. If
<i>N</i> is negative, i.e. preceded by a <i>-</i> character, then the message
will be displayed before the level, when it is initially visited.
Otherwise, when <i>N</i> is positive, the message will be displayed at the
successful completion of the level, before proceeding to the next
level. (Positive values can be prefixed with a <i>+</i> character, but this
is not required.)
<p>
Messages can appear in any order in the messages file.

<h3>
The User Configuration File
</h3>
<p>
Tile World stores a couple of user-controlled configuration values in
a text file, to be used as default settings on the next invocation of
the program. Each entry in this file is a single line of the form
<i>NAME</i>&nbsp;<tt>=</tt>&nbsp;<i>VALUE</i> and <i>NAME</i> typically matches the name of the
equivalent command-line option.
<p>
There are currently two possible values in this file:
<p>
<tt>volume = </tt><i>N</i>
<p>
This line sets the initial volume level. <i>N</i> can be any integer between 0 and
10.
<p>
<tt>initial-levelset = </tt><i>LEVELSET</i>
<p>
This line identifies a particular level set to be selected at startup.
<p>

<h3>
The Solution File
</h3>
<p>
Tile World saves its solutions in binary files, typically named with
an extension of <tt>.tws</tt>. Solution files are stored in the save
directory. They are the only files that Tile World actually creates.
<p>
Note that all numeric values in the solution file are stored
little-endian, for the sake of consistency with the data file format.
<p>
A solution file begins with the following eight-byte header:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;0-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>the 32-bit signature, always equal to <tt>0x999B3335</tt>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>the ruleset of the solutions: 1 for Lynx, 2 for MS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;5-6&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>the number of the most recently visited level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>count of bytes in remainder of header (currently always zero).</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
When reading a solution file, a program should always read byte 7 and
seek past that many bytes before continuing. This allows for future
expansion of the header.
<p>
After the header is a series of records. Prepended to each record is a
32-bit value that indicates the size of the record. Thus, a program
does not need to fully examine each record to find the next record.
<p>
Two special size values should be noted here. A 32-bit size value of
zero ostensibly indicates a zero-length record, and can be safely
ignored. A 32-bit size value of <tt>0xFFFFFFFF</tt> indicates that no more
records appear in the file -- i.e. it functions as an EOF marker.
(Neither of these values appear in solution files created by Tile
World, but they may be useful to other programs in certain
situations.)
<p>
The very first record in the file is optional. If present, it provides
the name of the associated level set, and takes the following form:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;0-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>all zero bytes; indicates that this record is present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;6-15&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>ignored; should be set to zero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>16...&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>A zero-terminated string naming the associated level set.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This record should not appear anywhere else in the file. Programs
looking for this record should examine the first six bytes of the
first record. If any of them are non-zero, then it should be assumed
that this record is not present.
<p>
The remaining records in the file should each be associated with one
of the levels in the level set. The levels typically appear in
numerical order, but this is not required.
<p>
There are two types of records. The smaller record is distinguished
from the larger record because it is always six bytes in size. It
provides a level's password but no solution, and its format is as
follows:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;0-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>the level number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;2-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>the level password, stored as four ASCII characters.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that, unlike the data file, the password is stored in "clear
text".
<p>
The larger record type provides both a password and a complete
solution. This record type has its own header, with the following
format:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;0-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>the level number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;2-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>the level password, stored as four ASCII characters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>other flags: currently always zero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>initial random slide direction and stepping value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>&nbsp;8-11&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>initial random number generator value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>12-15&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>the time of the solution, in ticks (20ths of a second).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>16...&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>the moves of the solution.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Byte 7 combines two separate pieces of information. The three lowest
bits contain the solution's initial random slide direction. (See below
for the encoding of directions.) This value is only meaningful under
the Lynx ruleset; for MS solutions these bits should be zero. The next
three bits provide the solution's stepping value. Under the MS ruleset
this value can only be zero or four; under the Lynx ruleset it can be
any value between zero and seven inclusive. The following C code
clarifies how the two values are combined:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>value = (steppingdir << 3) | slidedir;</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
After the header, the remaining bytes of this record specify the
solution proper. A solution consists of a sequence of moves. A move is
defined by two pieces of information: a direction, and a time. Time
is, as always, measured in ticks. A single tick is equal to 1/20th of
a game second.
<p>
For the first move of a solution, the associated time is the absolute
time at which the move occurs. For subsequent moves, the associated
time measures the number of ticks, less one, that elapsed between it
and the previous move. For example, imagine a solution consisted of
the following three moves: <tt>0:N</tt>, <tt>3:W</tt>, <tt>9:S</tt>. This would translate
to a move north at tick 0, a move west at tick 4, and a move south at
tick 14.
<p>
There are three kinds of directions that can appear in a solution. The
first kind (and by far the most common) is a simple orthogonal
direction, and is encoded as follows:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>0&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>= north</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>1&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>= west</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>2&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>= south</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>3&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>= east</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The second kind is a diagonal direction, and only appears in solutions
under the Lynx ruleset.
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>4&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>= northwest</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>5&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>= southwest</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>6&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>= northeast</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=center>7&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>= southeast</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The third kind of move is created by using the mouse under the MS
ruleset. It is encoded as a value between 16 and 376 inclusive. The
value specifies a relative x-y offset, ranging from (-9,&nbsp;-9) to
(+9,&nbsp;+9). The coordinates are packed into a single move value by the
following calculation:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>value = 16 + ((y + 9) * 19) + (x + 9);</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the most general case, then, a move requires 9 bits for the
direction value and 23 bits for the time value, or 32 bits total.
However, in a typical solution, the vast majority of moves consist of
small time and direction values. In order to conserve space, there are
four different formats for storing move values. The four formats vary
in size from one to five bytes. Each value is stored little-endian, so
the least significant byte of each value contains sufficient
information to determine the value's format and size. Thus, in order
to reconstruct the moves of a solution in detail, a program must read
the solution as a stream of bytes, examining each value in turn.
<p>
The four formats are defined as follows. The diagrams indicate the bit
contents of each.
<p>
The first format can be either one byte in size:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>76543210</tt>
<br>
<tt>TTTDDD01</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or two bytes:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>11111</tt>
<br>
<tt>54321098 76543210</tt>
<br>
<tt>TTTTTTTT TTTDDD10</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
In each of the above diagrams, the bits marked with <tt>D</tt> contain the
direction value, and the bits marked with <tt>T</tt> contain the time value.
The two lowest bits contain either 1 or 2, indicating the format and
the size.
<p>
This format can be used to encode orthogonal and diagonal moves when
the time value is 2047 or less. (The smaller size can be used only if
the time value is 7 or less.)
<p>
The second format is four bytes in size:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>33222222 22221111 11111</tt>
<br>
<tt>10987654 32109876 54321098 76543210</tt>
<br>
<tt>0000TTTT TTTTTTTT TTTTTTTT TTT0DD11</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
This format provides 23 bits for the time value, allowing for any
legal time value. Only two bits are provided for the direction,
however, so this format can only be used to encode orthogonal moves.
Bits 0, 1, and 4 in the lowest byte identify this format.
<p>
The third format packs three moves into one byte:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>76543210</tt>
<br>
<tt>FFEEDD00</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
The bits marked with <tt>D</tt>, <tt>E</tt>, and <tt>F</tt> encode three different
directions. These are assigned to three consecutive moves. Each move
is given a time value of four ticks (i.e. <tt>T</tt> = 3). Like the second
format, only orthogonal moves can be stored in this format.
<p>
The fourth format is the most general. Like the first format, it can
vary in size. It can be two, three, four, or five bytes long,
depending on how many bits are needed to store the time value. It is
shown here in its largest form:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>33333333 33222222 22221111 11111</tt>
<br>
<tt>98765432 10987654 32109876 54321098 76543210</tt>
<br>
<tt>000TTTTT TTTTTTTT TTTTTTTT TTDDDDDD DDD1NN11</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
The bits marked with <tt>N</tt> indicate the number of bytes that the value
spans. Thus <tt>N</tt> = 0 indicates two bytes, and <tt>N</tt> = 3 indicates a
five-byte value.
<p>
Nine bits are provided for the direction value, making this format the
only one that can encode mouse moves. The time value is either 2, 10,
18, or 23 bits in size, depending on the size of the value.

<h3>
The Resource Configuration File
</h3>
<p>
The resource configuration file serves as an index to the various
resources that Tile World needs to access at runtime. It is a plain
text file, stored in the resource directory, and is always named <tt>rc</tt>.
<p>
The file contains lines of the form:
<p>
<i>resource</i><tt> = </tt><i>filename</i>
<p>
where <i>resource</i> is a symbolic resource name, and <i>filename</i> is the
name of a file in the resource directory.
<p>
The resources can be set differently depending on the ruleset that the
program is using. A line in the <tt>rc</tt> file of the form
<p>
<tt>[</tt><i>ruleset</i><tt>]</tt>
<p>
indicates that the lines that follow only apply when that ruleset is
in effect (where <i>ruleset</i> is either <tt>MS</tt> or <tt>Lynx</tt>). Resources that
are defined before any such line apply to both rulesets, and are also
used as fallbacks if a ruleset-specific resource could not be
loaded. Note also that some resources need to have ruleset-independent
values, as indicated below.
<p>
A line of the form
<p>
<tt>TileImages = </tt><i>FILENAME</i>
<p>
identifies the file that provides the images used to draw the game.
These images are stored in a Windows bitmap. See <a href="tworldff.html#7">The Tile Bitmap</a> for
more information about this file.
<p>
A line of the form
<p>
<tt>Font = </tt><i>FILENAME</i>
<p>
identifies the file that provides the program's font. The font is
stored as a Windows bitmap. See <a href="tworldff.html#6">The Font Bitmap</a> for more information
about this file. A ruleset-independent font must be provided in order
to display the initial list of level sets.
<p>
A line of the form
<p>
<tt>UnsolvableList = </tt><i>FILENAME</i>
<p>
identifies the filename for the database of unsolvable levels. See
<a href="tworldff.html#5">The Unsolvable Levels Database</a> below for more information about this
file. Note that this resource should always be a ruleset-independent
entry, as it is loaded during initialization.
<p>
Four resources define the colors used in rendering text:
<p>
<tt>BackgroundColor = </tt><i>RRGGBB</i>
<br>
<tt>TextColor = </tt><i>RRGGBB</i>
<br>
<tt>BoldTextColor = </tt><i>RRGGBB</i>
<br>
<tt>DimTextColor = </tt><i>RRGGBB</i>
<p>
The value of <i>RRGGBB</i> is a string of six hexadecimal digits defining
the red, green, and blue values of the color (as with the color
specification used in HTML or X Windows, but without the preceding
octothorpe). Again, font colors should have ruleset-independent
definitions in order to display the initial list of level sets.
<p>
The remaining resources define the game's sound effects. The sounds
are stored as Microsoft RIFF files (so-called wave files). Unlike the
tile images, each sound effect is defined as a separate file. The
complete list of symbolic resource names is as follows:
<p>
Sounds used in both rulesets
<ul>
<li><tt>LevelCompleteSound</tt>
<li><tt>ChipDeathSound</tt>
<li><tt>BlockedMoveSound</tt>
<li><tt>PickupToolSound</tt>
<li><tt>ThiefSound</tt>
<li><tt>TeleportSound</tt>
<li><tt>OpenDoorSound</tt>
<li><tt>SocketSound</tt>
<li><tt>SwitchSound</tt>
<li><tt>BombSound</tt>
<li><tt>SplashSound</tt>
</ul>
<p>
Sounds used only under the MS ruleset
<ul>
<li><tt>TickSound</tt>
<li><tt>ChipDeathByTimeSound</tt>
<li><tt>PickupChipSound</tt>
</ul>
<p>
Sounds used only under the Lynx ruleset
<ul>
<li><tt>TileEmptiedSound</tt>
<li><tt>WallCreatedSound</tt>
<li><tt>TrapEnteredSound</tt>
<li><tt>BlockMovingSound</tt>
<li><tt>SkatingForwardSound</tt>
<li><tt>SkatingTurnSound</tt>
<li><tt>SlidingSound</tt>
<li><tt>SlideWalkingSound</tt>
<li><tt>IceWalkingSound</tt>
<li><tt>WaterWalkingSound</tt>
<li><tt>FireWalkingSound</tt>
</ul>
<p>
(Note that the symbolic names for the shared and MS-only sounds match
the names in the <tt>entpack.ini</tt> file used by the Microsoft program.)
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="5"></a>
<h3>
The Unsolvable Levels Database
</h3>
<p>
The database of unsolvable levels provides a list of levels that Tile
World should identify as unsolvable. It is a plain text file, and is
stored in the resource directory, and optionally also in the user's
save directory. If the file is present in both places, Tile World will
use their union.
<p>
The list of unsolvable levels are grouped by level set. Each group is
introduced by a line of the form:
<p>
<tt>[</tt><i>LEVELSET</i><tt>]</tt>
<p>
where <i>LEVELSET</i> is the name of the level set for the following lines.
<p>
Each line defines one unsolvable level. These lines are of the form:
<p>
<i>NUMBER</i><tt>:</tt> <i>IDENTIFIER</i><tt>:</tt> <i>COMMENT</i>
<p>
where <i>NUMBER</i> is the level's number, and <i>IDENTIFIER</i> is a short
string of characters that identifies the contents of that level. The
second colon and <i>COMMENT</i> field are optional. If present, the
<i>COMMENT</i> should be a very brief sentence fragment describing why the
level is unsolvable. This comment will then be displayed to the user
when they visit this level.
<p>
Note that a single level can usefully have more than one entry, as
long as each one has a different <i>IDENTIFIER</i>. This would indicate
that a level designer had released multiple versions of a level which
were all unsolvable.
<p>
The <i>IDENTIFIER</i> is a twelve-digit hexadecimal value, calculated by
hashing the level's representation in the data file and prepending the
level's size in bytes.
<p>

<h3>
The Font Bitmap
</h3>
<p>
The font used by the program is defined by a Windows bitmap file,
which is found the resource directory.
<p>
The bitmap uses three different colors of pixels to define the glyphs
of the font. The three pixel colors are used to indicate glyph pixels,
halftone pixels, and background pixels. When the glyphs of the font
are rendered by the program, the halftone pixels will be displayed in
the color that is halfway between the background color and the
foreground color. Thus the halftone pixels are useful for doing simple
anti-aliasing of the glyphs.
<p>
The pixel in the top-left corner must be the color of the glyph
pixels. The pixel immediately below this must be the color of the
background pixels. Any other pixel colors in the bitmap are taken as
halftone pixels. Note that the colors used in the bitmap do not affect
the actual colors used in rendering the font.
<p>
All glyphs must be of the same height, though the widths may vary
freely. The glyphs appear in rows, and are read in reading order: from
left-to-right, then top-to-bottom. Each row of glyphs includes an
extra line of pixels above it. In addition, there is an extra column
of pixels running down the left side of the bitmap. These pixel-wide
lines contain markers that locate the separation between individual
glyphs.
<p>
The left column of pixels will have one glyph-colored pixel per row of
glyphs in the bitmap. The height of each pixel in the left column
indicates the height of the row of pixels above each row of glyphs.
All other pixels in the left column will have the background color.
<p>
The glyphs in a given row will be separated from each other by a
single column of pixels. This column will be indicated by a
glyph-colored pixel directly above it, in the row of pixels. All other
pixels in the rows will have the background color. There will also be
a glyph-colored pixel immediately after the last glyph in a row. (The
net result is that every glyph will have a glyph-colored pixel on
either side.) Each row can contain any number of glyphs; anything to
the right of the last glyph in a row is ignored.
<p>
The glyphs in the bitmap will correspond to the ISO-8859-1 characters
32 through 126 inclusive, followed by an alternate set of ten decimal
digits, followed by the characters 160 through 255 inclusive. (It is
not possible to define glyphs for the characters 0 through 31 or for
the characters 127 through 159.) The alternate decimal digit glyphs
should be monospaced versions of the decimal digits; Tile World will
use these digits to display numbers in aligned columns.

<h3>
The Tile Bitmap
</h3>
<p>
The appearance of the game's tiles are defined by one or more Windows
bitmap files, which are stored in the resource directory.
<p>
There are three different formats that the tile image bitmap can use.
(The program automatically determines which one is being used by
examining the dimensions of the bitmap.) They are referred to here as
the small format, the large format, and the masked format.
<p>
The <i>masked format</i> is essentially the same one that is used by the
original MS program. In fact, anyone with a copy of the original
program and a resource editor can extract the bitmap from the Windows
executable and use it with Tile World directly. The tiles are laid out
in a 13x16 grid. The first four columns of the bitmap are:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>Empty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>Clone Block S</td>
<td align=left>Overlay Buffer&nbsp;</td>
<td align=left>Wall SE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

<p>
Each of these tiles are drawn with an empty tile in the background.
The next three columns repeat the images of the previous three
columns, but with a pure white background instead. The last three
columns then have the "masks" for these images. The mask images are
monochrome, with black used for the background and white used for the
figure. When the program is displaying a creature, a key, or a pair of
boots, it uses a tile from columns 4-6 if the item is upon an empty
tile.  Otherwise, it uses the image from columns 7-9, coupled with the
mask from columns 10-12, to combine the image with the proper floor
tile image.
<p>
The <i>small format</i> is an abbreviated layout of the masked format. The
tiles are laid out in a 7x16 grid. The first four columns are the same
as with the masked format. The remaining three columns contain the
creatures, boots, and keys (again, as with the small format) with a
solid background of magenta pixels (RGB=255,0,255). When the bitmap is
read by Tile World, all magenta pixels in the last three columns will
be made transparent. (Magenta pixels in the first four columns will
not be altered.) If you wish to use magenta in any of these tiles
(e.g., for the balls), then you will have to use one of the other
formats instead.
<p>
The <i>large format</i> is the only format that permits inclusion of animated
tiles. This format has a less rigid layout. Tiles are arranged in rows
instead of columns. The tiles are extracted from the bitmap in reading
order -- scanning from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.  The rows do not
have to have a specific width.
<p>
A one-pixel-high horizontal line is above each row of tiles. The
pixels in this line indicate the divisions between tiles in the
row. There is also a one-pixel-wide vertical line at the left edge of
the bitmap, which is used to indicate the placement of the rows.
<p>
One color is used throughout the bitmap to indicate transparency.
This color can be magenta, or some other color. The program determines
which color is used to show transparency by reading the color of the
second pixel in the horizontal line above the first row -- pixel (1,0)
in x-y coordinates.
<p>
The vertical line on the left side of the bitmap has a non-transparent
pixel at the position of the horizonal lines above the tiles. All
other pixels in the vertical line must be transparent. (The
non-transparent pixels can be of different colors.) The horizontal
lines have a non-transparent pixel at the rightmost edge of each tile
image. (Note that the tile images are separated from each other by a
line of pixels vertically, but not horizontally.)
<p>
The first tile in the first row is the Empty tile. The Empty tile
cannot be animated, nor is it permitted to have any transparent
pixels.
<p>
The next 49 tiles in the bitmap are the following, in order:
<p>
<blockquote>
Force Floor N; Force Floor W; Force Floor S; Force Floor E; Random
Force; Ice; Ice Wall NW; Ice Wall NE; Ice Wall SW; Ice Wall SE;
Gravel; Dirt; Water; Fire; Bomb; Bear Trap; Thief; Hint Button; Blue
Button; Green Button; Red Button; Brown Button; Teleport; Wall; Wall
N; Wall W; Wall S; Wall E; Wall SE; Blue Wall; Toggle Floor; Toggle
Wall; Popup Wall; Clone Machine; Red Door; Blue Door; Yellow Door;
Green Door; Socket; Exit; IC Chip; Red Key; Blue Key; Yellow Key;
Green Key; Ice Boots; Force Boots; Fire Boots; Water Boots.
</blockquote>
<p>
(Note that there are no tile images for Hidden Walls. These tiles
always use the Empty tile image. Likewise, there is only a single tile
used to display a Blue Wall, whether the wall is real or fake.)
<p>
The tiles can be broken up across any number of rows, and each row can
be of different length.
<p>
Any of these tile images can have transparent pixels. Those that do
will have their transparent pixels replaced with the corresponding
pixels from the Empty tile image. Note that if the bitmap is intended
to be used under MS emulation, then the Keys and Boots need to be
rendered with transparent backgrounds.
<p>
These tiles may also have more than one image supplied for them. Those
that do will be animated under Lynx emulation; Tile World will loop
through the images in the sequence while the game is playing. (Under
MS emulation, only the first image in the sequence will be used.) In
this case, the horizontal line above the row will have only one
non-transparent pixel, placed at the rightmost edge of the last tile
in the sequence. (The tiles of a single animated sequence may NOT be
broken up across rows.)
<p>
The next 10 tiles following these are:
<p>
<blockquote>
Extra Exit 1; Extra Exit 2; Burned Chip; Bombed Chip; Exited
Chip; Water Splash; Chip Swimming N; Chip Swimming W; Chip
Swimming S; Chip Swimming E.
</blockquote>
<p>
With the exception of "Exited Chip", these tiles are only used during
MS emulation. They cannot be animated; each tile can only have a
single image. Transparent pixels are permitted, however, and will be
handled as before.
<p>
After these come the following 12 tiles:
<p>
<blockquote>
Chip; Pushing Chip; Block; Tank; Ball; Glider; Fireball; Bug;
Paramecium; Teeth; Blob; Walker.
</blockquote>
<p>
These tiles will usually have one of a set number of multiple images.
Note that some of the possible layouts require rows that are two tiles
high. Any given row in the bitmap is of a fixed height all the way
across, however. So any change of height between neighboring tile
images requires that a new row be started in the bitmap.
<p>
The possible "sub-layouts" of the images of these 12 tiles are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>1x1: A single image. The lone image is used to display the creature,
regardless of its movement or orientation.
<li>1x2: Two images side by side. The left image shows the creature
moving N and S, and the right image shows the creature moving W and E.
<li>1x4: Four images in a single row, showing the creature moving N, W,
S, and E, respectively.
<li>2x1: Two images, arranged in a column. The top image shows the
creature moving N and S, and the bottom image shows the creature
moving W and E.
<li>2x2: Four images arranged in a square. The top two images show N and
W movement, and S and E constitute the bottom row.
<li>2x8: Sixteen images, giving four animated images per direction. The
top row contains the four N images followed by the four W images,
and the bottom row contains the four S images followed by the four E
images.
<li>2x16: Sixteen images, but each image occupies two tiles' worth of
space. The leftmost 2x4 area contains the four animated images of
the creature moving N. Each image is two tiles high, and is drawn
across both tiles as the creature moves. (Note that the final image
will ideally be completely transparent in the bottom half.) The next
2x4 area has the four animated images of the creature moving S,
arranged as before. The right half contains the images of the
creature moving W and E. These images are a single tile high but two
tiles wide, with the sequence of four W images appearing above the
sequence of four E images.
</ul>
<p>
Finally, the bitmap contains three more tile images:
<p>
<blockquote>
Water Splash; Explosion; Disintegrate.
</blockquote>
<p>
The images for these tiles can either be 1x1 or 3x3 in size. There
should be exactly twelve images for each. (If there are only six, each
image will be displayed for twice as long.)
<p>
The following notes clarify the meanings of the names used to identify
the tile images.
<p>
The ice wall tiles are identified by their open sides. Thus "Ice Wall
NW" indicates an ice tile with thin walls on the S and E sides.
<p>
The parenthetical parts of tile names distinguish between tiles that
are identical in appearance. Thus, "Blue Wall" is suffixed by "(f)" or
"(r)" to indicate "fake" or "real" walls.
<p>
The "Overlay Buffer" tile is used by the program as a place to build
up images made with one or more transparent tiles. Whatever is
actually placed here in the bitmap will only be visible if a level
containing this tile is displayed before it is ever used by the
program. Normally this tile contains a duplicate of the Empty tile
image.
<p>
The "Exited Chip" tile and the two "Extra Exit" tiles are used by the
original MS program to create the ending sequence shown after
completing one of the two final levels. The two "Extra Exit" tiles are
used with the main "Exit" tile to create an three-frame animated
sequence.
<p>
The "Empty (Unused)" tile in the first two formats indicates tiles
that are not used by the program, and normally appear the same as
Empty.
<p>
In the original MS program, the tiles marked "Explosion" and
"Disintegrate" are actually unused, and contain an Empty tile
image. These extra tiles only appear during Lynx emulation. (If your
masked format bitmap is only intended to be used under MS emulation,
these tiles can be left as Empty.) "Explosion" is displayed when a
bomb goes off; "Disintegrate" is displayed when Chip collides with
another creature.
<p>
The "Water Splash" tile is displayed by the MS game when Chip dies
from walking into a water square. The "Burned Chip" tile is displayed
by the MS game when Chip dies from walking into a fire square. The
"Bombed Chip" tile is not used by the original program unless it is
explicitly inserted in a level's map.
<p>
Note that the "Water Splash" tile appears twice in the large format.
The first occurrence is as a single tile used only for MS emulation,
and the second occurrence is an animation sequence used only under
Lynx emulation.
