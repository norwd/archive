<h1>Orthogonal</h1>
&hellip; is an unusual computer language in which your program flow
can go sideways. In actuality in can go in just about any direction
you could want.
<p>
Orthogonal is currently a proof-of-concept experiment, and right now
the language is rather primitive. Nonetheless, a working interpreter
has been created, and several non-trivial programs have been written
for it, including the pi spigot algorithm.

Irving</a>, this is a version of the Orthogonal interpreter written in
Excel macros, allowing you to view the program as it runs.

Here is a list of known Orthogonal programs:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="hello.or">Hello World</a>. Self-explanatory.
<li><a href="echo.or">Echo I</a>. Echos the command line, one argument
    at a time.
<li><a href="echo2.or">Echo II</a>. Echos the command line, one character
    at a time.
<li><a href="beer.or">Beer</a>. Sings "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
<li><a href="atoi.or">AtoI</a>. Interprets a decimal number on the
    command line.
<li><a href="bang.or">Bang</a>. Computes the factorial.
<li><a href="factor.or">Factor</a>. Computes prime factors.
<li><a href="pi.or">Pi</a>. Computes digits of pi.
<li><a href="istring.or">IString</a>. Automatically generates
    string-initializing code for C-INTERCAL.
<li><a href="change.or">Change</a>. Counts different ways to
    make change.
</ul>
