  <h1>Millennial Madness</h1>
  <h2>Spud and Brian's New Year's Bash - 2001</h2>

  <p>

  <i>A Chronological and Incomplete Record</i>

  </center>

  <p>

  So <a href="../../../~mikeh/index.html">Spud</a> and <a
  href="../../../~breadbox/index.html">Brian</a> have been
  throwing a biennial News Years shindig for the past ten years.  The
  party usually consists of a bunch of us who went to <a
  href="http://www.evergreen.edu/">college</a> together, and anyone we
  might have picked up along the way.  The event is usually pretty
  freakin' cool, and has always taken place in a posh Seattle hotel.

  <p>

  This time around, in order to commemorate the millennial roll-over,
  Spud and Brian decided to completely outdo themselves by throwing
  this year's event in one of the Presidential Suites at the <a
  href="http://www.fourseasons.com/locations/Seattle/index.html">Four
  Seasons Hotel</a>.  This was easily the fanciest hotel I'd ever been
  in - I felt incredibly under-dressed as soon as I walked into the
  lobby.  The party itself was fully catered by the hotel, and
  featured a full-service open bar.  This latter detail will no doubt
  be evident in the following photos.

  <p>

  In a daring step towards The Future , the music was provided via a
  laptop and seven hours worth of MP3s.  This was, in turn, piped
  through the room's adequate sound system.  The play list was worked
  out by Spud and me, and we even went so far as to ensure that the
  segue between tracks was okay.  Yes, we're <em>that</em> dedicated
  to your party experience....

  <p>

  One picture I took, which came out quite <a
  href="p0000147.jpg">poorly</a>, was of the list of events in the
  hotel that day.  "Hamrick Family Function" was listed as occuring in
  the Cascade Room.  We all got a damned good laugh outta this.

  <p>

  There were a bunch of folks at the party who didn't wind up in front
  of my camera, mainly 'cause I'm knew to this whole "take pictures of
  things" concept.  My apologies to everyone I missed (especially the
  well-dressed Amazon contingent of Hitesh, Kotas, and Blunt).  "I'll
  get you next time."
