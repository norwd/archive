<b>Muppetlabs Directive 397B46-Z009:</b> The history of the TCP/IP
node 'Eidolon'.  By directive of His Tentacled Slimeness Gorlak, the
Official History of the Internet Node Eidolon is hereby made available
to you, the drooling public.  We make this information available in
the hopes that it will offer a modicum of comfort to you as we
systematically absorb all other TCP/IP nodes into the Muppetlabs
Consortium.  View it, and be amazed.

<p>

TCP/IP node 'Eidolon' was constructed during Muppetlabs Profit Cycle
(MPF) 849779842 (which certain of you Earth-beings refer to as
Sol-Rotation +1994) by MH311.  Upon proving its usefulness, Eidolon
was absorbed into the Muppetlabs domain during MPF 849866242,
providing the first foothold on Earth for the inconceivably large
Muppetlabs Corporate Empire.  Multi-Dimensional Being Gorlak (VP,
Interstellar Affairs, Adjunct to Earth) was dispatched to oversee the
invasion.

<p>

Eidolon was immediately put into the care of DC1020, who went to work
upgrading the node using what passed for cutting-edge technology on
Earth at the time.  At the command of Gorlak, serveral Drones were
grown and dispatched to help with the expansion of the Muppetlabs
TCP/IP Sol subnet.  Eidolon was chosen to serve as the host for these
Drones, and soon they began toiling away for the CANONICAL_PURPOSE.

<p>

In order to obtain financing for the CANONICAL_PURPOSE, Drone MH311
was fitted with a Windows Programming Capability module and put to
work in the field. However, after three years MH311's immune system
rejected the module. Another drone, BR903, was immediately grown and
fitted with an improved version. This drone has survived for five
years, with only minor side effects, and has supplied Eidolon with
adequate financial resources. (It remains to be seen how much longer
his system will accept the module, which has since expanded to over
three times its original size.)

<p>

It was not long after Drone MH311 was rehabilitated that Muppetlabs
became aware of the potential utility of the <a
href="http://www.speakeasy.org">Speakeasy Cafe and Information Trading
Post.</a> Drones were quickly placed at the Speakeasy installation,
and soon their network was ready to host the now-incredibly-advanced,
upgraded Eidolon (code-named "Shub-Eidolon").

<p>

Through the combined mechanations of <a
href="../~breadbox/index.html">BR903</a>, <a
href="../~chris/index.html">CO149</a>, <a
href="http://www.bachelor.com/">AB427</a>, <a
href="../~mikeh/index.html">MH311</a>, and <a
href="../~deadman/Muppetlabs/index.html">DC1020</a>, the
"Shub-Eidolon" was moved into place at the Speakeasy, where it has
blossomed into the Ultimate Tool for the CANONICAL_PURPOSE.  Hundreds
of thousands of packets have already traversed its network interfaces,
each one leaving with the Muppetlabs Header of Acceptance.

<p>

Gorlak is pleased.
