<h2>Quick and Dirty Guide to Page Publishing</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Step 1: Your "Web directory"</b>
  <dd>In your home directory, there should be a directory called
      ".html" - if it doesn't exist, then create it (using the
      <i>mkdir</i> command).  Make sure that it is world-readable
      (using the <i>chmod</i> command - "chmod a+r .html").
      <p>
  <dt><b>Step 2: The Default Web Page</b>
  <dd>There should be a document in your .html directory called
      "home.html" - this is the default document that the Web server
      will look for if no specific document is called.  Make sure that
      your top-level, or "home" page is called "home.html".
      <p>
      As always, make sure that it is world-readable.  Use the
      <i>chmod</i> command as shown above.
      <p>
  <dt><b>Step 3: Revenge of the CGI Script</b>
  <dd>Since Eidolon is so cool, users are free to write and run their
      own CGI scripts.  CGI scripts are those cool, simple little
      things that handle HTML forms and the like.  To let the Web
      server know that you have a CGI script, name your script
      <i>scriptname.cgi</i>.  That's all there is to it.
      <p>
      Tutorials on CGI scripting can be found at <a href="web.html?">foo</a>.
      <p>
  <dt><b>Step 4: How to Access Your Page</b>
  <dd>If you wanted to post your URL to Yahoo! or Lycos, you would
      write it like so:
      <p>
      <ul>
	http://www.muppetlabs.com/~your_user_name
      </ul>
      <p>
  <dt><b>Step 5: Other Considerations</b>
  <dd>Let the world know just how cool you are - be sure to create
      subdirectories in your .html directory, especially for
      things like images and sound files.  It'll keep your directories
      clean and orderly, and will demonstrate your level of Clue to
      the rest of the 'net community.
