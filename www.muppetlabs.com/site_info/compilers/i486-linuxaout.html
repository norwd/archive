In the earlier days of Linux there was only one executable program
format, called a.out.  If you find yourself needing to compile a
program for an older Linux box that doesn't support the newer ELF
format (which gcc uses by default) this is the target you want to use.
<br>
Examples:
<br>
<pre>
	% gcc -b aout test.c
	% gcc -b i486-linuxaout test.c
</pre>
Either one of these will work, 'aout' is a handy alias for 'i486-linuxaout'
which is sorta hard to remember/type.
