The sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4 target is for sparc based sun machines running
SunOS.  Eidolon has this target mainly so we can quickly compile stuff
to run on Eve, or machines like it.  The fact that is for SunOS 4.1.4
should really matter, it should work for most any version of SunOS,
provided that the machine has a sparc processor.
<br>
<br>
Examples:
<br>
<pre>
	% gcc -b sparc test.c
	% gcc -b sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4 test.c
</pre>
Either one of these will work, 'sparc' is a handy alias for
'sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4' which is sorta hard to remember/type.
<br>
<br>
This may change in the future if we get a sparc-sun-solaris* cross compiler.
