On Eidolon, GNU CC will by default compile for i486-linux.  This
is version 2.7.2 of the GNU CC compiler.  Objects and binaries
built with this compiler are all in the ELF binary format.  Modern
versions of Linux support this format.  If you need to compile a
program to be used on older version of linux which does not support
the ELF binary format, compile using '-b aout' which should
build the appropriate a.out format binaries.  If you are building
a program to be run on Eidolon itself, this is the prefered compiler.
