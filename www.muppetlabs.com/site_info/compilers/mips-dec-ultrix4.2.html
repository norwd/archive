The mips-dec-ultrix4.2 target is for compiling programs fit to run on
mips machines running Digital's most hideous Ultrix OS.  This cross
compiler has been successfully used to compile stuff for Elwha, which
if you currently attend school at The Evergreen State College you're
all to familiar with.

<br>
Examples:
<br>
<pre>
	% gcc -b mips test.c
	% gcc -b mips-dec-ultrix4.2 test.c
</pre>
Either one of these will work, 'mips is a handy alias for
'mips-dec-ultrix4.2' which is sorta hard to remember/type.
