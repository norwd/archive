Here are a few pictures from my first (and I hope not the last) Dutch Cube Day that took 
place in Leiden, The Netherlands on the 6th of October 2002. For me, it was the biggest 
concentration of cube-crazy minds since the World Championship in 1982. I finally got to meet
face to face with many of my on-line friends:

<A HREF="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/angela.hayden/cube/cube_frontpage.html">Olly Hayden</A>,
<A HREF="http://members.lycos.nl/tdennenbroek/">Ton Dennenbroek</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.speedcubing.com">Ron van Bruchem</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.student.kuleuven.ac.be/~m9916714/">Lars Vandenbergh</A>, and
<A HREF="http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/PetersCubePage.html">Peter Jansen</A>. <P>

We all had a lot of fun at the meeting, sharing ideas and algorithms. I was told that my (best) cube would make
a pretty good muscle-building tool. After trying Ron's or Peter's cubes, I had to agree ... I sure do 
have some reserves there. So, I ordered some Rubik's Studio cubes from Ton Dennenbroek and asked him for his
expert opinion on how to prepare a speedcubing cube instead of a muscle building tool. Thank you Ton!

At lunch, Ron asked me to solve the cube at full speed and pulled out his watch. Dan Gosbee pushed his watch back 
and calmed me down by decisively stating that no one will be measuring anything. However, once I solved the cube, Dan quickly
glanced at his watch saying "seventeen". I think, we have the best organizer (or misdirection master) for the 
<A HREF="http://www.rubikswc2003.com/pages/812467/index.htm">championship</A>, guys and girls.

At the end of the Cube Day, there was a competition on the stairs in the hallway. I changed my mind at the
last moment, quickly grabbed Ron's cube and joined the competition at the last second. Without warming up and
practically zero inspection time, I did a shameful 22 seconds and discredited my reputation in front of people
from at least six countries. After the compatition, Ron, Ton, Peter, Olly, Mirek, and myself went to a Chinese 
restaurant in downtown Leiden. During the dinner, we were doing magic tricks and trying to open Olly's small clear plastic
puzzle box (me breaking two nails before finally giving up). After the dinner, we removed our cubes and put up quite a
show for the restaurant personnel.
