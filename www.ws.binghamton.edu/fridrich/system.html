Winter 1996/97: The system described here enabled me to win the First Czechoslovak Championship in Rubik's Cube, which took place in April 1982. 
When I was at my best, I routinely solved the cube in an average time of 17 seconds. At that time, I was actively using more than 
100 algorithms, but the basic required minimum is 53 algorithms. Before I go on and describe the details of my system, 
I would like to express my thanks to Mike Pugh who retyped the algorithms from my old notebook to HTML and added nice graphics. 
His enthusiasm helped me to find the cube no less interesting than some 15+ years ago when I met it for the first time. Special 
thanks belong to <A HREF="Mailto:mgoljan@binghamton.edu">Mirek Goljan</A>, my 1982 finale rival, who kindly provided his enormous 
collection of algorithms as it appears here today.<P>There are a number of diferent systems suitable for speed cubing, but all can 
be roughly divided into two main categories: corners-edges and by-layers. My system belongs to the second category even though the
first two layers are really formed at the same time rather than in sequence. The basic set 
of algorithms consists of 53 algorithms for the last layer and a couple of simple moves for the second layer together with a lot 
of experience. Most of the algorithms were developed by myself during the time period between the summer 1981 and the spring of 1983. 
However, other speed cubists, most noticeably <A HREF="MAILTO:mgoljan@binghamton.edu">Mirek Goljan</A>, have also significantly 
contributed with important moves. Here is my system in a nut shell:

<H2><A NAME="unique"></A>Unique features</H2>One of the unique features of this system is that the last layer is always solved 
using two algorithms of an average length of 9 and 12, which is very  efficient. The average lengths are based on frequencies 
with which various <A HREF ="Mike/orient.html">orientations</A> and <A HREF ="Mike/permute.html">permutations </A> occur and 
on the length of algoritms for each position. Another interesting feature is that for the first two layers no lengthy algorithms 
are needed and you can use your intuition and utilize the specifics of the particular initial state and subsequent states of 
the cube.
<P>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="second"></A>The first two layers</H2>

In an attempt to make this description complete, I supplied several 
<A HREF="Mike/middle.html">algorithms</A> which can help you solve the first two layers. Although most of the algorithms will be 
obvious to an experienced speed cubist, some of them are less trivial and are in my opinion very valuable. In addition to that, one should 
always try to use the specifics of any given state of the cube rather than blindly apply the algorithms. For example, when two or 
three corners are already correctly placed, it may be advantageous to keep the last corner free and insert all middle cubes using 
the free corner. Actually, some speed cubists use this approach as their default. Alternatively, when accidentaly (or intentionally) 
two or more middle cubes happen to be positioned correctly, one can place the corners from the first layer via the free middle edge(s). 
All these moves and a lot of practice should enable you to solve the 
first two layers in about 10-12 sec. Of course, this requires a lot of practicing, but let us say that 15-20 sec. will be realistic 
for most folks.
<P>
Because I was receiving a lot of requests for "additional hints" and advice for the middle layer, I decided to include another section
with practical <A HREF="f2l.html">advice</A> for solving the middle layer. Here are a few <A HREF="examples.html">examples</A> of how
I think out loud when doing the middle layer. I hope this will help you to master the system faster!

<P><BR>
<H2><A NAME="last"></A>The last layer</H2>

Some systems for solving Rubik's cube "by-layers" divide the solution 
of the last layer into four stages: orient edges, place edges, orient corners, place corners. It is possible to group together two 
and two stages to speed up the process. It seems natural to orient and place edges in one move and then orient and place corners in 
the second one. However, this approach has one big disadvantage - it is very difficult to recognize various positions quickly. A 
better approach is to orient edges and corners at the same time and place all of them simultaneously. Convince yourself that there 
are 41 different <A HREF="Mike/orient.html">orientations</A> of the cubies in the last layer, and 14 different 
<A HREF="Mike/permute.html">permutations</A> of those 8 cubies. Here, we do not count <A HREF="Mike/reflect.html">symmetric</A> 
positions or <A HREF="Mike/inverse.html">inverse</A> (backwards) positions as different because they can be solved using one 
algorithm. Different orientations are easily recognizable by patterns formed by the color of the last layer and a brief look at 
the sides of the cube. There are two patterns "C", four "I", two "T", etc. Most of the permutations are also easily recognizable. 
Given an average twisting speed of three moves per second, one can solve the last layer in 3 + 4 seconds (based on the average 
number of moves). <P>In theory, we could come up with a much larger system of algorithms which would enable us to solve the last 
layer in one algorithm. However, the number of algorithms one would need to learn is 1211.<BR>
