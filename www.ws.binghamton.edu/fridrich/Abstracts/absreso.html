Its properties, such as invertibility, and continuity are studied. Operators acting on objects under finite resolution are divided into two groups, vertical and nonvertical, depending on whether or not they are continuous with respect to approximation sequences. Applications in image processing, mathematical morphology, and fractal geometry are discussed.<BR><HR><A HREF="../fridrich.html"><IMG SRC="../images/back.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Home page " width="136" height="28"></A>
