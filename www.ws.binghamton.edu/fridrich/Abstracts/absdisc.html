Assuming that the imprecision of measurements manifests itself as a finite partition of the phase space, general necessary and sufficient conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct orbits are presented. Two reconstructing methods and their pseudocodes are presented and analysed. The applicability of those methods is tested using a series of computer experiments for various one-dimensional mappings on the unit interval. Potential applications are also discussed.<BR><HR>
