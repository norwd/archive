On this page, you will find a few video clips of me solving the cube. You will need the (free) <A HREF="http://www.divx.com/divx/">DivX codec</A>, to view the movies. Also, if you want to view them frame by frame, I was told that you need <A HREF="Video_clips/VirtualDub-1.5.3.zip">VirtualDub</A> under the <A HREF="http://www.virtualdub.org/gpl">GNU</A> license. I have also put some of my favorite finger tricks because they are a lot of fun. In "Stick", I reach 10 moves per second for three seconds. Overall, it was a lot of fun to watch myself on the screen. It is a completely different experience!<P>

<TD>This was my first solve in 16.74 sec. You can tell that I am still stiff in it because of the delays between algorithms. The time was not that bad considering my rough cubing style.</TD></TR>

<TD>The F2L were in 9 seconds, which was not bad, but then I got stuck in the permutation algorithm. Yeah, I need to work on my LL permutations, I know ... but the final time was 15.98 sec.</TD></TR>

<TD>OK, I will be critical to myself again. This one was in 16.48 sec, again with lots of delays between algorithms. I think I should rely less on speed and go for a more reliable approach that is a bit slower but more smooth without that many delays. Isn't that what I advise everybody? :) </TD></TR>

<TD>This one was really really weird. 14.33 sec. - a blooper was cancelled out with a lucky permutation. I inserted two corner-edge pieces in the F2L wrong and I had to switch them. Then I got an orientation that I like (four corners) and a trivial permutation. Without being lucky, I would have gotten probably around 17.something.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="Video_clips/FSstick.avi"><IMG SRC="images/FSstick.jpg" BORDER=0 ALT="Home page " width="254" height="183"></A></TD>
<TD>My favorite finger trick - the Stick named aptly after shifting gears in a car with manual transmission. No, I do not drive that fast :) By counting frames, I determined
30 moves in 89 frames, which translates to 10 moves per second sustained for 3 seconds. I know, this is just a repetitive move, so it
is easier to achieve that speed. It will be very hard to beat Lars Petrus' <A HREF="http://www.lar5.com/cube/speed.html">Sune</A> at 7 moves in 0.7 seconds. That looks like magic, indeed!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="Video_clips/FSslice.avi"><IMG SRC="images/FSslice.jpg" BORDER=0 ALT="Home page " width="253" height="183"></A></TD>
<TD>Just a finger frenzy using a repetitive slice move.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="Video_clips/FSfour.avi"><IMG SRC="images/FSfour.jpg" BORDER=0 ALT="Home page " width="255" height="183"></A></TD>
<TD>I use those four moves when finishing the permutation algorithm V (the second on my <A HREF="Mike/permute.html"> permutations </A> page).</TD></TR>
