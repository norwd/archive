<a href="BlindfoldRevenge.pdf">this document</a> which 
has tips.]<br>
For completeness 2x2x2 cubes. I don't describe any 2x2x2 cubes here but they are 
detailed in the .pdf file.<br>

This cube has permutation 4 1 6 7 5 2 3 8 and orientation 2 2 2 0 0 1 0 2.
<br>
This page does not detail any 2x2x2 cubes that I have solved blindfolded.
<br>
All recording of the initial state of the cube is done after the cube has been solved.
<br><br><br>
This is a description of the first Rubik cube (3x3x3) that I solved with 
one look (blindfold cubing) and the way I solved it. Nothing must be written down in advance 
of solving the cube. (It must all be done mentally, except for the 
twisting of course which must be done without looking at the 
cube. Practice twists are not allowed. The notes here were all 
made after the cubes were solved sometimes the next day.)<br><br>
It helps to have a good memory! I have actually got a pretty terrible 
visual memory but my memory for numbers is pretty good (I once remembered 
pi to 830 decimal places).<br>
(Pictures will follow the descriptions)<br>
Edges are numbered thus: (UF, UB, UR, UL, DF, DB, DR, DL, FR, FL, BR, BL 
are edges 1-12 respectively).<br><br>
Edges are given an orientation as follows: the colours of the U and D 
faces 
are labelled high priority, those of the F and B faces medium priority and 
those of the R and L faces low priority. Given an edge it lies in two 
faces - if the part of the edge with higher priority lies in the face of 
higher priority then the edge is correctly oriented (orientation 0) 
otherwise it is incorrectly oriented (orientation 1).<br><br>
(The sum of the edge orientations needs to be 0 (mod 2)).

Corners are numbered thus (D counts as 4, B as 2, L as 1, U, F, R as 0 and 
the constituent parts summed - thus the UBL corner is corner 
0+2+1=3).<br><br>

Corners are oriented as follows: if a corner needs no clockwise twisting 
to 
get its high priority colour into a high priority face it is correctly 
oriented, and has orientation 0, if it needs one twist it has orientation 
1 (or rather it needs 
+1 and so is really oriented +2) and if 2 then it has orientation 2 (or 
rather it needs +2 and so is 
really oriented +1). (The sum of the corner orientations needs to be 0 
(mod 3)).<br>

The edge and corner permutations need to have the same sign (viewed as 
permutations in S_20 their product must be even).<br><br>

Back to the first 3x3x3 cube I solved blindfolded.
The state of the cube<br><br>
(White was up, green was front)
Edge Permutation (this is the hardest bit to remember)<br>

1 7 12 2 10 6 11 3 9 4 5 8 (were in positions 1-12 respectively)<br>

Edge Orientation<br>

The edges that weren't correctly oriented were those in positions 4,10,11, 
12<br>

Corner Permutation<br>

1 6 8 7 4 2 3 5 (were in positions 1-8 respectively)<br>

Corner Orientation<br>
The corner that needed +1 to its orientation was in position 7.<br>
The corners that had needed +2 to their orientation were in positions 1, 
3, 5 and 6.<br><br>

Also, I will use the notation Ch(Y,Z) to denote that the cube is being 
positioned such that the face that was originally the Y face is put into 
the U face position and the face that was originally the Z face is put 
into the F face position.

The Solution<br><br>

I started off by orienting the corners firstly the corners in positions 5 
and 7. To do this, I performed Ch(F,D) and then the move 
R'D'LDRD'L'DUL'UR2U'LUR2U2 - while I was at it I also 3-cycled the 
corners in positions 5, 7 and 8 (5->7->8->5) using D'LD'R2DL'D'R2D2 
before doing Ch(U,F).
This put corner 5 into its correct position but also put made the B face 
such that its corners needed only to be diagonally switched to get them 
into position.<br>
Next I did D to get the corner originally in position 6 into position 5 so 
that I could orient the corner in position 1 which I did with 
R'D'LDRD'L'DUL'UR2U'LUR2U2 after which I again did D to get the corner 
originally in position 6 into position 7. Then I did Ch(U,R) and again 
did the move 
R'D'LDRD'L'DUL'UR2U'LUR2U2 to complete the orientation of the corners. 
After this I did the move D2 to get the corner originally in position 6 
back into position 6.<br>
After this I did Ch(U,B) and then the following move to 
diagonally switch the corners F2RaF2Ra'Ua'F2Ua. This was followed bu 
Ch(U,F).<br>
At this point the position and orientation of the edges had not changed at 
all but all the corners were correctly oriented and all but the corners in 
positions 2 and 6 (which were transposed) were correctly positioned.
I decided next to orient the edges and I did the edges on the B face 
first.<br>
First I did Ch(B,D) and then the move FsUF'U'Fs'LFLF2ULsF2RsUF2. Then, 
I did Ch(L,B) followed by the move LsFRsU2LsFRsB2U'RsB2LsU'B2 to reorient 
the remaining edges and then again Ch(U,F). At this point the part of the 
solution that I had planned was over and I had to plan as I went.<br>
Fortunately, the edge permutation was still fixed in my mind. The first 
thing I did was an edge 3-cycle in the U face. I did Ch(U,R) and then 
did R2UFsR2BsUR2 before Ch(U,F).
This made the new edge permutation: 1 2 7 12 10 6 11 3 9 4 5 8. <br>
This was followed by Ch(U,L) and then 
L2F'UsL2DsF'L2 to 3 cycle the edges in positions 4, 12 and 8 (4->12->8). 
Because the 3-cycle was done on the L face it didn't change the 
orientations. I then again did Ch(U,F).<br>
This brought edges 12 and 8 into position and the new edge 
permutation was:1 2 7 3 10 6 11 8 9 4 5 12. 
Following this was Ch(U,R) and then R2F'DsR2UsF'R2 to 3-cycle the edges 
in positions 3, 7 and 11 (3->7->11) followed by Ch(U,F). 
This move brought edges 11 and 7 into position and the new edge 
permutation was: 1 2 5 3 10 6 7 8 9 4 5 11 12.<br>
This was followed by Ch(U,L) and the move D'R2F'DsR2UsF'R2D before 
Ch(U,F).<br>
This 3 cycled edges 3, 10 and 4 (in positions 4, 5 and 10) (3->10->4) 
making the new edge permutation:1 2 5 4 3 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.<br>
After this, I decided that all the incorrect pieces should be in one face 
so I did the move URaF2Ra'Ua'F2UaU to perform the edge double 
transposition 
of the edges 3 & 5 and 9 & 10 (in positions 5 & 3 and 9 & 10 
respectively).
This made the new edge permutation: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 9 11 12.<br>
I decided to do the final permutation with F face as U face but in order 
to do this I needed to reorient the corners 2 and 6 (in positions 6 and 2 
respectively) to make their orientations correct for the F layer (as high 
priority layer)). To do this I first did Ch(U,L) followed by the move 
R'D'LDRD'L'DUL'UR2U'LUR2U2. Then I did Ch(F,L) 
(before realizing that I wanted to actually do Ch(F,R) so I quickly made 
this alteration) and made the move U'L2DF2D'L2B2D'R2DB2 to get everything 
into the correct position. Finally, I did Ch(U,F) and put the 
cube down.<br>
Then I looked at the cube and it was indeed solved. : )
<br><br>
Currently my best time for solving the 2x2x2 cube blindfolded (time being 
advance preparation time) is 12 seconds - for this, I ensure that the DBL 
corner is correctly positioned and oriented so that I only have to 
remember a permutation from S_7 and orientations of 7 pieces.
<br><br>
My second solved 3x3x3 cube whilst blindfolded<br>
The state of the cube - this got me most corners already oriented<br><br>
(Yellow was up, orange was front)<br>
Edge Permutation<br>
12 3 5 2 9 7 1 6 8 11 4 10<br>
Edge Orientation<br>
Only edges in positions 1,2,5,6 were correctly oriented<br>
Corner Permutation (8 cycle)<br>
2 5 7 6 4 3 8 1<br>
Corner Orientation<br>
Corners 1,5 needed +2,+1 respectively and corners 4,2 needed +2,+1 
respectively.<br>
I remembered the edge permutation like this: 12 3 (is sort of ascending, 
digitwise anyway), 52 is number of cards in deck, 97=6*16+1 (OK, that was 
a bit weird but I'm a mathematician), 16 is a square, 81is a bit like 911 
but 100 short, 410 was what was left (it was closer to half 811 than 104 
too).<br>
I remembered the corner permutation like this: 25 is a square, 76 
something to do with trombones, 43=25 (the first bit+18 the last bit in 
reverse), 81 is a square. I was hopeful I wouldn't have to use such 
obscure stuff and just be able to recall the numbers, which luckily I 
was.<br>
I decided to orient all the edges incorrectly because only 4 edges were 
correctly oriented (less to remember with 4 as opposed to 8) and then flip 
them all back at the end.<br>
Strategy: corners 1,5 were oriented first as they were in prime position 
(R'D'LDRD'L'DUL'UR2U'LUR2U2) then corners 2,4 (via 
LCh(U,L)<br>
R'D'LDRD'L'DUL'UR2U'LUR2U2<br>
Ch(U,F)L').<br>
Then I flipped the two pairs of edges 1,2 and 5,6:<br>
U'FsUF'U'Fs'LFL'F2ULsF2RsUF2U<br>
Ch(D,B)<br>
U'FsUF'U'Fs'LFL'F2ULsF2RsUF2U<br>
Ch(U,F)<br>
Already, my pre-planning was at an end (except to flip all the edges at 
the end) and I decided to work on the corners):<br>
To this end, I decided to do try to switch 7,6 and 4,3 and worked out that 
if I did:<br>
F2 (get 4,3 in up layer)<br>
U2 (switch corners diagonally but need to...)<br>
RaU2Ra'Fa'U2Fa (fix edges)<br>
F2 (get 7,6 in down layer)<br>
then that would leave my corners permuted thus:
2 5 4 3 7 6 8 1, so that's what I did.<br>
Then I did<br>
B2<br>
B'RB'L2BR'B'L2B2<br>
B2<br>
(a little overkill on the B's but not to take chances) to cycle corners
(1 5 8) and hence leave the corner permutation:<br>
2 1 4 3 7 6 5 8.<br>
By doing Ch(D,B)R'FR'B2RF'R'B2R2Ch(U,F) (cycling (6 7 5)) and then 
L'BL'F2LB'L'F2L2BL'BR2B'LBR2B2 (double transposition (1 2)(3 4)- there 
are better ways, but I didn't want to think of them at the time) I was 
able to get the following corner permutation
1 2 3 4 6 5 7 8<br>.
Finally, Ch(D,B)U'L2DF2D'L2B2D'R2DB2Ch(U,F) got me to the point where my 
corners were solved, but I had switched edges 7 and 9, so that my edge 
permutation was:<br>
12 3 5 2 7 9 1 6 8 11 4 10.<br>
I decided to position the edges in the down layer first.<br>
Ch(D,B)<br>
R2UFsR2BsUR2 (cycling (1 7 9))<br>
L2U'BsL2FsU'L2 (cycling (9 6 1))<br>
Ch(U,F)<br>
brought the edge permutation to 
12 3 5 2 1 6 7 9 8 11 4 10.<br>
Then U<br>
RaF2Ra'Ua'F2Ua<br>U' was used to perform the double transposition (1 5)(8 
11) to leave the edge permutation:<br>
12 3 1 2 5 6 7 9 11 8 4 10.<br>
Luckily this meant that with:<br>
Ch(F,L)<br>
R2FDsR2UsFR2<br>
Ch(U,F)<br>
I was able to bring both edges 8 and 10 into place giving the edge 
permutation:<br>
12 3 1 2 5 6 7 8 11 10 4 9<br>.
This was quickly followed by<br>
B2U2B2U2B2U2 (to effect (1 2)(4 9)) and then 
U'(R2U2R2U2R2U2)U (to effect (1 2)(9 11) - somewhat efficiently with the 
Us) to obtain the edge permutation:
12 3 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 4.<br>
R2UFsR2BsUR2 followed to cycle (12 3 1) to leave 
1 12 3 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 4.<br>
After this, I thought for a short time to see whether L was going to mess 
up my orientation for corner 4. It wouldn't so I cycled (12 4 1) via:
L<br>
L2U'BsL2FsU'L2 (nearly messed up here, as I was still a little 
undecided so I started L2L'2L2 but I couldn't remember for definite 
whether I had really done L'2<br> L')<br>
to leave edge permutation: 4 1 3 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.<br>
Then L2UBsL2FsUL2 finally positioned the edges.<br>
I still had to flip all the edges and if I could remember the quick way to 
do this I would, but I didn't want to risk it so I did it 2 at a time:<br>
Ch(B,D)<br>
FsUF'U'Fs'LFLF2ULsF2RsUF2 (fixing 11,12)<br>
Ch(F,D)<br>
FsUF'U'Fs'LFLF2ULsF2RsUF2 (fixing 9,10)<br>
Ch(D,B)<br>
LsFRsU2LsFRsB2U'RsB2LsU'B2 (fixing 5,8)<br>
U2<br>
LsFRsU2LsFRsB2U'RsB2LsU'B2 (fixing 6,7)<br>
U2<br>
Ch(U,F)<br>
U2<br>
LsFRsU2LsFRsB2U'RsB2LsU'B2 (fixing 1,3)<br>
U2<br>
LsFRsU2LsFRsB2U'RsB2LsU'B2 (fixing 2,4).<br>
Then I put the cube down.<br>
Then I looked at the cube and it was indeed solved. : )<br>
Third cube<br>
(Up was white, front green as I recall)<br>
Corner Permutation 3 8 5 7 2 6 4 1<br>
Corner orientation: those in positions 1,3,7 needed +2.<br>
Edge permutation 7 11 8 4 3 5 6 9 10 12 2 1<br>
Edges to be flipped in positions 6,8,1,10,9,11<br>
Recalling of permutations: 38 is quite close to the year of a relative's 
birthday, 57 Heinz varieties, 26 year of Queen's birth, 41 year of a 
relative's birth<br>
7-11 24 hour store in Headington nr. Oxford [also there are a few in the 
US : ) ], 84 year of (most recent) LA Olympics, 35 is quite close to the 
same year that 38 was close too, 69=2*35-1, 10,12,2,1 something like 
10+2=12*1 and I wanted to 3-cycle 10->12->1 to place 10 and 12 
correctly.<br>

or 3,7 then 1,7 (adding +2 to the corners on the Up face and +1 twice to

9th and 10th cubes<br>
(Up was white, front green)<br>
These occurred in 2 failed attempts to do 2 cubes blindfolded - the first 
was on my second attempt at such a feat, the second on my third attempt 
[was a double transposition of corners out on the other cube. : (]<br>
I seem to have lost my records of the initial states of these cubes - possibly, I didn't 
record them as I may not have recalled the initial positions after solving the cubes.<br>
11th and 12th cubes<br>
(In both cases Up was White and front was green)<br>
I did these cubes consecutively (on one look for the both of them - not 
one look each). : )<br>
Conditions were made worse with a bad cold. I did these cubes whilst 
listening to the 7th game of the 2001 World Series.<br>
I started c. 10 minutes before the game was due to start and finished the 
second cube in the second innings.
The following is the state of the cubes (possibly I have some details in 
the wrong cubes, but I think this was the right way - certainly the 
orientations and permutations are correct but there's a small chance I may 
have listed them for the wrong cubes - e.g. switched the edge permutations 
for cubes 11 and 12.)
11th Cube<br>
Corner Permutation: 4 1 7 3 6 8 2 5
Corner Orientation: Corners in positions 1, 3 and 8 needed +1, corners in 
positions 5, 4 and 6 needed +2.
Edge Permutation: 2 1 10 3 9 8 7 12 6 5 11 4
Edge Orientation: Edges in positions 3, 4, 9, 11, 5 and 8 needed to be 
flipped.
Remembering the permutations: 41 family birthday/year really, 73 Double 
Agent (OK, so it's a bit tacky), C. Myers, Square.<br>
To be honest the edges were not bad at all - on doing a cross on the top, 
I'd get 1,2 and 3 into position. 987 was descending as was 654 which was 
split by 11 which was correctly placed.<br>
The orientations on this cube were harder so I did the cube first and 
stored the orientations in short term memory.
12th Cube<br>
Corner Permutation: 7 2 4 3 8 5 1 6
Corner Orientation: Corners in positions 3 and 6 needed +1, corners in

Remembering the permutations: 72 my birthyear, 43 was descending, 85 
C. Ficatier, 16 Square.<br>
512 (RAM in my machine), 14 I just sort of remembered this as what was 
left, 2,3,6,10 2*3=6 and I remembered 10 on the end, 9, 7, 11, 8 - 9 and 
11 were placed already and 7,8 came in that order.<br>
Orientations: since there wasn't manyhere I just remembered them. I always 
try to remember them in the pairs that I am going to orient together. Here 
it was 2,4 (very straightforward on top) and 5,7 (D'(similar move to 2,4 
but with D in U position and F at back)D) - for the corners 5 and 6 paired 
and so did 3,8 on D'(look at R side to do move)D. 
13th Cube<br>
(Up was white, front green)<br>
Corner Permutation: 6 2 8 3 1 4 7 5<br>
Corner Orientation: Corners in positions 7, 8 and 4 needed +1. Corners in 
positions 1,2 and 3 needed +2.<br>
Edge Permutation: 10 8 11 5 3 7 6 9 4 2 1 12<br>
Edge Orientation: Edges in positions 1,3 2,10, 9,11, 5 and 6 needed to be 
flipped.<br>
(This was part of an attempt to do 2 cubes. A yellow sticker came off the 
second cube mid-solution (I had just finished orienting the edges) so I 
had to abort the mission. That cube was as follows:<br>
Corner Permutation: 5 4 2 6 1 8 7 3<br>
Corner Orientation: Corners in positions 1 and 6 needed +1. Corners in 
positions 2 and 5 needed +2.<br>

flipped.<br>
NB This cube attempt was aborted but no mistakes had been made.)<br>
14th Cube<br>
(Up was white, Front was green)<br>
I did this cube as a time trial - I had been asked how long it takes to 
memorize a 3x3x3 cube before solving blindfolded and didn't really know 
the answer. This cube took 2 minutes 47 seconds to memorize.<br>
I can't recall the details of this one but the corner permutation was:<br>
Corner Permutation: 1 2 7 8 3 6 5 4<br>
15th and 16th Cubes<br>
(In both cases Up was white and Front was Green)<br>
I did these cubes together as a time trial. The cubes took 15-16 minutes 
to memorize - I was going off the clock on my VCR - no seconds.<br>
The state of the cubes are given below.<br>
Again, I did the more difficult (to memorize) cube first - mainly it 
was because of the corner orientation.<br>

Solution<br>
I flipped the edges first this time.<br>

2. Flip edges 10,12.<br>
3. Flip edges 9,8<br>
4. Flip edges 7,6.<br>
5. Flip edges 8,5.<br>
6. Twist edges 2,1 (+1,+2).<br>
7. Twist edges 3,5 (+1,+2).<br>
8. Twist edges 3,8 (+1,+2).<br>

10. 3-cycle corners (8 7 4).<br>
11. 3-cycle corners (4 3 1).<br>
12. 3-cycle edges (6 12 7).<br>
13. 3-cycle edges (3 2 9).<br>
14. 3-cycle edges (2 9 1). (This and 13 could have been done in 1 shot but 
I did it this way.)<br>
15. Double transpose edges (2 6)(3 7).<br>
(Here I realised that I had misremembered edge 10 as 9 (had 2 9's in mind) 
but fortunately I could tell which was which as I recalled the original 
colours; otherwise I'd have to check which gave an even permutation - 
time consuming)
16. Double transpose edges (10 11)(3 12).<br>
17. Double transpose edges (5 4)(3 12). (This and 15 could have been 
done in 1 shot but I did it this way.)<br>

19. 3-cycle edges (9 4 8).<br>
20. 3-cycle edges (4 5 2).<br>
21. 3-cycle edges (1 2 5). (via double transposition (2 5)(9 11) 
followed by double transposition (1 5)(9 11)).<br>
22. I put the cube down.<br>
23. I removed the blindfold and indeed it was solved.<br>

<h1>Rubik Revenge</h1>
OK, here are the details of the first Rubik Revenge I solved blindfolded. 
(February 17th 2002)<br>
As far as I am aware this has never been done before.<br>
It was my sixth attempt (the first two I forgot the exact way of doing 
one of the algorithms - I didn't realize until afterward the 2nd attempt 
and so messed up quite a bit, the next 2 I was interrupted (the former 
heavily, the latter not so and I probably slipped up earlier) and the 5th 
I lost concentration and forgot what I'd just done so I aborted that 
attempt.<br>
On this attempt I had a bit of fortune with the initial centres. Generally 
my strategy would be to start the cube so that no centre squares from the 
U face lay in the D face (this is always possible as there are just 4 
squares and 6 faces) but here there were 3 on one side and 1 on the 
opposite side, so I used the one with 3 as U face - fortunately there were 
2 from the D face already there too and the B centres were quite nice.<br>
First the description of the cube - labelling of pieces and set up:<br>
the corner pieces are labelled as in the regular Rubik cube that is 1-8 
and will a correction of 0,+1 or +2 needed for their orientation.<br>
The centres are labelled by colour (U=1,D=2,F=3,B=4,R=5,L=6 - in my case 
White=1,Blue=2,Green=3,Yellow=4,Red=5,Orange=6).
They are memorized in groups of 4 according to face (the order of the 
faces being the same as that of the colours U,D,F,B,R,L) and within each 
face from left to right then up to down according to the net:<br>
<table><tr><td></td><td>U</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>L</td><td>F</td><td>R</td><td>B</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>D</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table><br>
(In particular, for instance the centres from the D face are memorized 
those near the F face before those near the B face and those near the L 
face before those near the R face - so in terms of nearness: near FL, FR, 
BL, BR.)<br>
The edges edges are labelled A-X as follows:<br>
UFR=A (the rightmost piece of the UF edge - White-Green in my case)<br>
UFL=B (the leftmost piece of the UF edge - White-Green in my case)<br>
UBR=C<br>
UBL=D<br>
URF=E<br>
URB=F<br>
ULF=G<br>
ULB=H<br>
DFR=I<br>
DFL=J<br>
DBR=K<br>
DBL=L<br>
DRF=M<br>
DRB=N<br>
DLF=O<br>
DLB=P<br>
FRU=Q<br>
FRD=R<br>
FLU=S<br>
FLD=T<br>
BRU=U<br>
BRD=V<br>
BLU=W<br>
BLD=X<br>
They are memorized in the natural order (the one that in the solved 
position would give them in alphabetical order). It is perhaps easier to 
remember them in groups of 4.<br>
It is not necessary to remember orientations as for the cube: an edge can 
only be placed in a position one way. If the edge appears to be oriented 
incorrectly it is because te wrong edge of the edge pair is in place.<br><br>
Here is the description of the cube I solved blindfolded.<br>

The centre permutation was quite nice on this occasion.<br>
Corner Permutation<br>

Corner Orientation<br>
22011201<br>
<br>
I solved the corners first (first orienting and then permuting) with moves 
that do not alter the centre squares or edges. (The corner permutation was 
even - had it been odd, then I would have needed to swap a couple of 
edges.)<br>
I then solved the centres with moves that do not alter the corners or 
edges.<br>
Finally I solved the edges with moves that do not alter the corners or 
edges. I had to flip the last edge.<br>
In particular, the order of solution can be changed - centres can be 
solved first, then edges then corners etc., the only restriction being 
that if the corner permutation is odd then at some point corners and edges 
will have to be moved at the same time (possibly 2 of each).<br>
The cube took about 16-17 minutes to memorize although I memorized it in 
the morning and did not begin solving until the evening (after Newcastle 
won their FA cup tie) - I had a quick recheck of the details to refresh my 
memory before I donned the blindfold and solved the cube. After I was 
done, I put the cube down (White face up and Green face, facing me). Then 
I removed the blindfold and saw it was solved. It was only after this that 
I wrote down the details of the cube (the initial set-up) - all prior work 
was done mentally, of course.<br><br>

two. I have about 7 new solved cubes to put up including 3 at one go 
(unofficially equalling the world record).<br>
28th and 29th Cubes (on a train journey to a follow-up interview)<br>
This was an attempt to do 3 cubes blindfolded. I got them memorized 
(starting from Newcastle) by Durham (18 minutes) plus a little refreshing 
afterwards but thought I should wait for the ticket collector so as not to 
be interrupted mid-attempt. That took over 90 minutes (past York) from 
leaving Newcastle so perhaps I wasn't up for it by then.
Anyway, the first cube I got a bit confused over (ending up with just two 
edges wrong it seemed) and I came back to it during the second cube, 
having remembered that I needed to switch 2 corners) but I had got a 
couple of edges wrong before and ended up a double transposition (1 3)(9 11) 
of edges out (all correctly oriented) but the remaining 2 cubes were 
solved correctly when I finally removed the blindfold.<br>
(Notes: Cube 1 (unsolved) (Up - white, Front - green: CP: 6 5 8 7 4 1 3 2,

30th, 31st and 32nd Cubes<br>
This was done later on the same day in a hotel (partly whilst Arsenal were 
on TV winning 4-1 hopefully, at time of writing, before doing rather less 
well to Newcastle in the weekend).<br>
I took a bit longer to memorize the cubes than the unsuccessful attempts. 
These cubes were also harder to memorize. some coincidental similarities 
made the task of getting the correct data associated with the correct cube more 
difficult.<br>
Unofficially, this attempt equalled the world record for 3x3x3 blindfold 
cubing.<br>

and will put it in here if I find it.<br>

(The third cube of the 4 was where I messed up. The cube was 4, 2, 8, 1, 7, 3, 5, 6; 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0; 7, 6, 2, 5, 1, 3, 11, 12, 9, 8, 10, 4; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Ironically it had easy edges. I culdn't recall whether the corners in positions 5, 6 and 7 needed +1 or +2. I went for +2 but against my 
gut feeling - thinking that that is usually wrong - and that was all that went wrong in the attempt.)<br>

(The last cube was where I slipped up. I either forgot during the solving process or didn't even notice in the memorization stage that the edges in positions 
11 and 12 needed to be flipped and that was all that was wrong. Frustratingly close again. The cube was 3, 8, 1, 4, 6, 2, 7, 5; 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1; 1, 7, 5, 11, 10, 12, 9, 8, 4, 3, 6, 2;

87th Cube (if my counting is right!)<br>
(Up was white, Front was green)<br>
(The next 4 cubes were a successful attempt at 4 cubes simultaneously and about time too! Total time was just under 2 hours 3' 30" of which approximately 60 
minutes was for the memorization. This can probably be beaten by quite a bit as I spent the last 43 of the 60 minutes reinforcing the information which I put in 
in the first 17 minutes, although it wasn't in soundly enough to complete it at that point. I used a new cube in place of my slack one, which I subsequently 
gave away, so I can't try 5 cubes yet.)<br>

96th Cube<br>
(Up was white, Front was green)<br>
(The next 4 cubes were a successful attempt to do 3 3x3x3s and a 4x4x4 simultaneously. This occurred on Sep 2nd-3rd. Total solving time was quite fast. I finished 
at 12.38 am and I'm not sure of the start time. I thought it was 11.42 but that would be sub 1 hour (this is only solving, not memorization as well) and that seems 
too fast, so I may have my start time wrong.<br>
I felt pretty confident after the first 3 cubes as I didn't think I had made any mistakes but the revenge slipped on me about 3 times including one time where it 
jammed and then slipped so I was less sure. I didn't want to abort the attempt but I went much faster than usual through it to get to the end as I thought it was probably 
not going to be OK and I wanted not to waste too much time.)<br>
