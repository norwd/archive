Here is my technique for doing the cube blindfolded starting with the 
2x2x2 cube. (My record for memorizing the 2-cube for solving purposes is 12 seconds to give you 
an idea of efficiency.)
It needs a good memory for numbers - my memory for the J. Fridrich moves 
is only good for half of them so far but my number memory is good).

1. Orient the cube so that the DBL corner is in the correct position and 
oriented correctly (of course, this is automatic unless you have a 
specific corner in mind - I always have white as up face and green as 
front face when blindfold solving the 2-cube so I have the 
blue-yellow-orange cube as DBL with blue on the bottom.)
2-3. (It doesn't really matter which order you do these in.)
Figure out the permutation of the first 7 corners - technically, you only 
need to remember the first 6 as since you have corner 8 in position that 
automatically gives corner 7).

For this purpose, my corners are labelled as follows:
Up Face, Front Face, Right Face, count as 0, 
Down Face counts as 1, Back Face as 2, Left face as 4. (Then add 1.) So it 
is like binary.
For instance the white-green-red corner is corner 1.
I then remember the sequence, e.g. 2 5 3 6 1 7 4 (I do actually take the 4 
on board although it is not strictly necessary - see above).

For the orientations, I remember the positions of the corners that need 
one twist and the positions of the corners that need 2 twists. There will 
always be at least one other corner (than corner 8) that doesn't need 
twisting.
That's all.

I don't blindfold cube for speed. I work out the solution after the 
blindfold part.
Part of this involves continuously having to change the permutation in 
your mind whern you get to that point.
Here is my technique.
First of all, orient the corners - after you do this you can forget about 
them if you only use orientation preserving moves.
For this purpose, I use 2 of the J. Fridrich sequences:
(e.g. to twist UFR twice and DFR once)
R'D'LDRD'L'D followed by 
UL'UR2U'LUR2U2.

Now for the permutation algorithms: I basically 
don't want to even possibly mess up so I only use the one algorithm which 
is the corner 3-cycle. Using corner 3-cycles only with corners in the U 
face or D face preserves orientation. (If you need to swap corners between 
these faces you may need to do a move like F2 or R2 etc. first and then 
cycle them out.)
OK, so by doing this you can get at least 6 corners in the right position 
and you can ensure that if 2 are bad then they both lie in the U face or 
the D face and that they are adjacent.
If there are 2 to switch the original permutation of corners was odd. This 
can be overcome by turning the U (or D) face once to get one of those 
corners in position leaving a 3-cycle to complete the work.

Further advice on solving the cube blindfolded can be seen on my webpage:

(actually, this is for the 3x3x3 cube; it's a bit boring perhaps, as for a 
number of the earlier cubes I went into great detail about how I solved 
each one. Later I just recorded the position of the cube(s) - since you 
can't write down the details in advance, it is possible that I may have a 
couple of errors in it, but it is correct to the best of my memory.)

Anyway, you can get techniques on solving the 3-cube blindfolded there 
too. I'll discuss this as it may be of some interest. The idea is much the 
same except you can't ensure that any corner is in place to start:

there are 4 things to memorize

corner permutation
edge permutation
edge orientation
corner orientation

The hardest is probably corner orientation because you have to remember 
not only the positions of the corners to twist but also how many times. 
Next comes edge permutation as it is 12 things to remember (although you 
could remember just 11). The other bits are fairly easy.
The technique I use is currently just to keep white up and green front 
(but I have on occasion done others) as then I know the numbers for the 
edges and corners and can memorize faster. Corners are labelled as before 
and edges are labelled 1-12 thus (UF, UB, UR, UL, DF, DB, DR, DL, FR, FL, 
BR, BL - thus the faces are prioritized U, D, F, B, R, L and labelling 
follows this - this is also helpful for remembering orientations).
Edge orientation is 0 (correct) is the edge has its high priority colour 
in the higher priority face and 1 (incorrect) otherwise. e.g. If the 
white-green edge is in the FR position it has orientation 0 if the white 
part is in the front face and 1 if the green part is in the front face - 
since white (being the colour of the up face) has higher priority than 
green (being the colour of the front face) and the front face has priority 
over the right face).
The technique is then to orient stuff before permuting.
Use 3-cycles to permute - there may be a signature problem with the 
permutations (i.e. you may have to switch just 2 corners at some point 
say). In this case, I usually try to get the corners adjacent and switch 
them with 2 edges in a T-formation.

This may be done after permuting various other edges.
3-cycling edges in the U,D,R,L faces preserves orientation of edges but in 
the F,B faces it changes the orienation of 2 edges so I don't 3-cycle in 
those faces.
I use a couple of other moves sometimes too.
e.g. (F2R2)3 does a double transposition switching edges UF with DF and UR 
with DR (and preserving orientations). Also Rs2F2Rs2B2 switches edges UF 
with DF and UB with DB etc.
I don't always do this but if you try to place the edges in the middle 
layer (9-12) or in one of the other layers, if you prefer then you can cut 
out a part of the permutation you need to remember.
A move I rarely do but may, if I remember it is 
(F2R2)3R(U2R2)3R' which 3-cycles edges 
in positions DF->UB->UF.
You can simplify it by cancelling some Rs
e.g. (F2R2)2R(U2R2)2U2R'.

I haven't mentioned orienting the edges yet:

I use 2 moves here (again from the J. Fridrich set)
First is 
LsFRsU2LsFRs followed by 
B2U'RsB2LsU'B2
(which flips UB and UL edges).

Second is
FsUF'U'Fs'LFL' followed by 
F2ULsF2RsUF2 
(which flips UR and UL edges).
My record for memorizing the 3-cube is 167 seconds.

For multiple cubes it gets a bit harder - I only have 2 3x3x3 cubes so I 
can't go for the record but I can do 2 cubes. The hardest thing is trying 
not to get confused over which stuff belongs to which cube. I always take 
the cube with the harder orientations first as this is the hardest bit to 
remember (for me). Since that bit is done first, it takes out the hard 
part at the start.

I haven't tried a 4x4x4 blindfolded (my old one broke so I can't, unless I 
use a subset of a 5x5x5 which might be confusing) but I have a fair bit of 
theory behind it and think it is quite possible.
My technique here would be:
orient corners,
solve the centres without disturbing edges or corners (I used to do this 
at the end when solving big cubes),
permute corners
3-cycle edge components without altering anything else to solve edges
solve like a 3x3x3 cube blindfolded
if needs be flip one edge using C Hardwick method.

Hope this is of some use,
