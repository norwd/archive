<H2><A NAME="customizing"></A>Customizing algorithms</H2>

<A NAME="adjust"></A>It is very important to customize <B>each</B> 
algorithm for your hands. Some of us are right handed, some left 
handed, some may prefer algorithms which use only 2 or 3 faces so 
that alternate twisting from left hand to right hand is avoided. 
Sometimes, it may be wise to perform an algorithm with the cube 
turned upside down, or twisted by 180 degrees. This adjustment must 
be done by each individual separately because everyone may have 
different views of which algorithms are user friendly and which are 
not. This takes a lot of time, but it may cut an important chunk 
from  your total time.<P>

<H2><A NAME="multiple"></A>Multiple algorithms</H2>As you 
may notice, some positions in the last layer have several algorithms 
associated with them. I alternate between them to minimize turning the 
cube as a whole, thus cutting on time.<P>

<H2><A NAME="finger"></A>Finger shortcuts</H2>Most speed 
cubists have also developed special sequences ("shortcuts or macros")
of two to four moves which can be performed astonishingly fast by 
pushing the faces with your fingers. Yes, it does require some 
dexterity. On my <A HREF="video.html">video</A> page you can watch
me solve the cube a few times. I also perform some finger tricks.<P>

<H2><A NAME="move"></A>Move algorithms to your 
subconsciousness</H2>It is also important that your brain automatizes 
the algorithms into inseparable units - elementary actions, because 
then you will not have to think about individual moves. The individual 
moves will be performed "by your hands" rather than making your brain 
busy. At this stage, one can afford to think more about the next step 
rather than about the algorithm which is being performed. It is done 
for you automatically by your subconsciousness! I noticed that this 
automatization goes that far that if I am interrupted while performing 
some longer algorithm, I will not be able to finish it! In a sense, I 
do not know the sequence of moves and perceive the algorithm as one 
unit. This may sometimes create comical situatioins when somebody asks 
you about a specific move, and you will not able to show it slowly 
- and will get stuck after several moves having to start over again to 
see the remainder of the algorithm.<P>

<H2><A NAME="delays"></A>No delays between algorithms</H2>
Another thing which is very important is to cut on delays between 
consecutive algorithms. One should minimize the decision time to 
almost zero. This issue is strongly connected with another one - the 
question of twisting speed.<P>

<H2><A NAME="faster"></A>Faster twisting does not have to 
mean shorter times</H2>Dogma: One needs to be especially dextered to 
be able to solve the cube that fast (in 17 seconds). I would be lying 
to say that some dexterity is not important, but I insist that an 
average person possesses the necessary dexterity to solve the cube in 
really short times. I believe that almost everybody can achieve the 
twisting speed of 3 twists per second. Remember, all you are required 
to do is to learn a finite set of algorithms perform quickly. This 
relates to the important issue of <A HREF="hints.html#adjust">adjusting</A> 
algorithms for your hands. So why is it possible that faster twisting 
speed may bring you longer times? By performing the moves really fast, 
one deprives him/herself of the [important] knowledge of what is 
actually happening to the cube. After performing an algorithm, one is 
then suddenly thrown into a new position and needs some time to decide 
which move to choose next. If you had turned the cube just little 
slower, you could actually see what is happening to the cube, and 
choose the best next move during the last couple of moves of the 
previous algorithm. If you compare the times: fast turns + delay 
between moves and slow turns + shorter delays, you will find out that 
the second summation may be shorter! Another argument for the second 
alternative is that it is very hard to turn the cube really fast, and 
one often encounters "stuck" cubicles, or breaks the cube to its atoms.
 This can slow you down as well as frustrate.<P>

<H2><A NAME="preparing"></A>Preparing the cube for record 
times.</H2>I have heard people recommend a variety of different 
lubricants for the cube. Among others, sillicon oil, graphite, and 
soap were mentioned. From my experience, sillicon oil worked best. Be 
careful before using  other lubricants because some of them may be 
pretty aggressive and speed up the aging process of your cube. Intense 
twisting causes a fine dust to develope inside the cube. Some cubists 
say that this kind of natural lubricant is the best one. I recommend 
to grease the cube because a lubricated cube will turn easier and you 
will be able to "cut corners" while speed cubing. But be aware of the 
fact that putting lubricant into a cube will make the cube more 
vulnerable to an accidental dismemberment.<P>

<H2><A NAME="hard"></A>Hard work</H2>
I would like to end with a couple of more remarks on the cube. First, 
the secret of achieving amazingly short times is not just the 
algorithms themselves. After all, a system will never solve the cube. 
Humans do! Probably the most important factor is dedication and a lot 
of practicing. As you may notice, some positions in the last layer 
have several algorithms associated with them. I alternate between 
them to minimize turning the cube as a whole, thus cutting on time.<P>

So, what is the best system for speed cubing? I do not 
think that there is such thing as the best system. One system may 
better fit one person, other system may be more natural for somebody 
else. I believe that any system which is worked out into sufficient 
perfection is good. We should not be comparing systems but cubists. 
Those certainly are comparable.<P>

<H2><A NAME="limits"></A>What are the limits of speed 
cubing?</H2>Any algorithmic set which can be performed by a human must 
be limited to a couple of hundreds at most thousands of algorithms. 
These algorithms need to be performed in a fast manner without too 
much thinking. This puts limits on the amount of time needed to solve 
the cube. If there was a hypothetical person who could see the 
shortest or the almost shortest algorithm right away in the beginning 
(which is quite improbable), he or she would need about 2 seconds, 
provided the farthest position is around 20 face moves at the twist 
rate of 10 moves per second. Since the assumption for this estimate 
will probably be unrealistic for many years to come, I estimate the 
limit for speed cubing at 5 seconds (the average time). One should 
totally abandon the concept of a record time since it has very little 
informational value. If somebody messes up the cube carelessly, one 
can take advantage of it and solve the cube in a few seconds. 
Therefore, for comparing purposes, I suggest to use an average of 10 
consecutive times. For my system, I defined the concept of a modified 
record: I discarded record times whenever more than one stage was 
skipped during the cube solving. By skipping a stage, I mean: placing 
the four edges using less than 3 moves, too much luck for the four 
blocks (in the second layer), skipping the orientation of 8 cubicles 
from the last layer, skipping the permutation part in the last layer. 
For the first two layers, it is hard to estimate the probabilities, 
but the last layer can be calculated exactly. The probability that 
after solving the second layer, the last layer will have the correct 
color is 1/216, and the probablity that after orienting the cubes in 
the last layer one will not need to permute them, is 1/72. So, for 
example, if the last layer got assembled by chance right after the 
second layer, I discarded the time since the probability of that 
happening is too small: 1/(216*72). So, what is my modified record? 
It is 11 seconds. My best average out of ten was often 17 in 1983. I 
kept myself in a good shape for many years, and I can still get to an
average of about 18 after all those years. Going back to 17 or lower
would require a lot of effort, good cube, and a complete devotion that
only a rookie can possess. So, good luck everybody and do not give up!
