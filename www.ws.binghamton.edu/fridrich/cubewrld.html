I totally fell in love with the cube. Even though the cube originator was
from Hungary - a neighboring country, it was easier to get the cube in
Japan rather than in Czechoslovakia. I got my first cube (out of approximately
18 which have been destroyed by myself during my cube career) in the summer
of 1981. In April 1982, I won the Czech Championship in Rubik's cube organized
by Czech magazine Mlady Svet. Out of three attempts to solve the cube,
the best time determined the rank. My time was 23.55 sec. If you are interested
about the details of my system for solving the cube, click <A HREF="system.html">here.</A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The same year on June 5, The First World Championship
in Rubik's Cube was held in Budapest in the Vigado Concert Hall. Total
19 speed cubists attended the event. The following countries were represented

<FONT SIZE=+1>The cubes were randomly shuffled by a computer, and were
brought on stage in a <A HREF="images/kufr.jpg"> sealed suitcase.</A> The cube was placed on a small pad
with with a photo sensitive diode at the bottom. The time started counting
when the cube was picked up, and stopped after the cube has been placed
back on the table. Before the timer started counting the time, each contestant
was allowed to lift the cube and look at it for 15 seconds. Then the cube
was returned to the pad. If the cube broke into pieces during twisting
the competitor was given another chance. However, two break ups resulted
in disqualification in that particular round (which happened to the champion
of Finland). The best time out of three attempts determined the winners.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> I ended up in the exact middle with a baaad time 29.11.
In my opinion, the championship had several severe flaws that mixed up
the results and caused me to believe that not the best one won (I think
that the Italian guy was the fastest among us - judging from practising
behind the curtain). First, as any speed cubist knows, the cube is manufactured
in two different colorings: white - yellow, red - orange, and green - blue,
and the other coloring is: white - blue, red - orange, and green - yellow.
Speed cubing requires a lot fast decisions for which one naturally uses
colors. Being used to one coloring and given a cube with the other coloring
makes the times longer. I was fortunate that the coloring of the cubes
did match the one I was used to. But it probably did not match for others.
Second, the cubes were really hard to turn and were not prepared for serious
speed cubing. The organisors should have prepared well greased cubes and
not a bunch of tools for excersizing finger musles! You can say: well,
everybody was given the same (bad) cube - so what's the big deal? The big
deal is that some guys used systems which use smaller number of moves,
yet one needs to spend little more time thinking, while others used systems
with very little delays between stages, but with a slightly larger number
of moves. All in all, the best guys from both camps would be approximately
equally fast. A hard-to-turn cube gave advantage to the first group. A
lot better solution would be to let the competitors use their own cubes.
It would not be that hard to label the cubes ...</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> It is also hard to accept Minh's time as the official
world record knowing almost a dozen of other guys who can solve the cube
consistently in a shorter time. It is a similar argument as claiming that
world records in track and fields can be counted only at Olympic games.
The fastest time I am aware of which has been achieved at an official championship
was achieved by <A HREF="http://cubefreak.hp.infoseek.co.jp/">Shotaro "Macky" Mackisumi</A>. 
He is probably one of the fastest cubers in the world.
