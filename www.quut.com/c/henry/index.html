From Henry's election information for the 1994
<a href="http://www.usenix.org">USENIX</a> board of directors:
<blockquote>
<p>
I've been a UNIX systems programmer for 19 
years now, first at University of 
Saskatchewan as an undergrad, then at University of
Toronto as a graduate student and an employee, now as an independent
consultant. 
<p>
I ran the first Usenet site in Canada, and am 
well-known as a Usenet contributor in many 
areas, notably the space and C groups.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Geoff Collyer and I wrote <i>C News</i>.
I just finished a first draft of the replacement for RFC 1036 
(the standard for news article format and processing),
and David Lawrence and I are rewriting O'Reilly's Nutshell Handbook on
managing Usenet. 
<p>
I've written various pieces of freely-available software:
the public-domain <i>getopt</i>, the first redistributable string library,
the widely-used redistributable regular-expression 
library, the 4.4BSD POSIX regular-expression library,
the <i>awf</i> text formatter, etc.&#160;<tt> </tt>
I also wrote <i>The Ten Commandments For C Programmers</i>, and
the ``regular expressions'' chapter for the forthcoming
``Software Solutions in C'' (Academic Press). 
<p>
I participated in the public reviews of the ANSI C standard,
am on the Standards Council of Canada working group that formulates
the Canadian position at ISO on C and related subjects, and was a member of 
the POSIX.2 technical working groups on regular expressions and awk. 
&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
I was co-chair of the demonstrations track for the CHI+GI 87 conference
(sponsored by ACM SIGCHI and CIPS CMCCS).&#160;<tt> </tt>I
was on the program committee for the 1989 winter USENIX, and am on the
program committee for the USENIX VHLL Workshop this autumn.&#160;<tt> </tt>
I've been the assistant to the Terminal Room Coordinator,
and technical trouble-shooter for the terminal room, at the last ten 
USENIXes.
