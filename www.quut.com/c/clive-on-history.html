<a href="msb-on-b.html#main">Mark Brader wrote</a>:<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>To go back to the beginning, once upon a time in England there was a<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>language called CPL. I've heard this acronym explained both as Cambridge<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>Programming Language and as Combined ...<br>
<p>
CPL officially stood for "Combined Programming Language", because it was
originally going to be developed by a joint team from Cambridge and London
Universities; it thus gained the nickname "Cambridge Plus London".
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>the first version of B there [...] did not support floating-point. Later<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>it was added by means of adding floating-point operators: #+, #*, and so on.<br>
<p>
These operators appear in most versions of BCPL other than on 16-bit machines;
I don't know whether B picked them up from BCPL or the other way round.<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>Here is a bit of C code and its B equivalent:
<pre>
&gt;     float infact (n) int n;
&gt;     /* or, of course, the newer float infact (int n) */
&gt;     {
&gt;             float f = 1;
&gt;             int i;
&gt;             extern float fact[];
&gt;
&gt;             for (i = 0; i &lt;= n; ++i)
&gt;                     fact[i] = f *= i;
&gt;
&gt;             return d;
&gt;     }
&gt;
&gt;     #define TOPFACT 10
&gt;     float fact[TOPFACT+1];
</pre>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>And now in B:
<pre>
&gt;     infact (n)
&gt;     {
&gt;             auto f, i, j;   /* no initialization for auto variables */
&gt;             extrn fact;     /* "What would I do differently if designing
&gt;                              *  UNIX today?  I'd spell creat() with an e."
&gt;                              *  -- Ken Thompson, approx. wording */
&gt;
&gt;             f = 1.;         /* floating point constant */
&gt;             j = 0.;
&gt;             for (i = 0; i &lt;= n; ++i) {
&gt;                     fact[i] = f =#* j;      /* note spelling =#* not #*= */
&gt;                     j =#+ 1.;               /* #+ for floating add */
&gt;             }
&gt;
&gt;             return (f);     /* at least, I think the () were required */
&gt;     }
&gt;
&gt;     TOPFACT = 10;   /* equivalent of #define, allows numeric values only */
&gt;     fact[TOPFACT];
</pre>
<p>
The BCPL equivalent would be:
<pre>
    MANIFEST ${ TOPFACT = 10 $)   // Equivalent of "const int TOPFACT = 10"
    LET infact (n) = VALOF
    $(
            LET f, j = 1., 0.

            FOR i = 0 TO n        // Declares i for the next block only
            $(
                    f #*:= j;     // := is assign, = is compare
                    fact!i := f;  // assignment doesn't return a value
                    j #+:= 1.
            $)
            RESULTIS f
    $)
    AND fact = VEC TOPFACT;       // As in B, allocates 0 to TOPFACT
</pre>
The use of AND means that fact is declared throughout infact.
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>The last line is of particular interest because it actually declares 12,<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>not 10, words of storage. In B the subscripts run from 0 to the declared<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>value, so [0] denoted a 1-element array. The extra word was a pointer<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>initialized to the first element of the array<br>
<p>
This worked in exactly the same way in BCPL, though the declaration used the
keyword VEC, and subscripting was done with the ! operator instead of [].
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>If you wanted to deal with character strings, you could either store one<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>character per word in an array and index them directly, or store one<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>character per byte and access them with library functions.<br>
<p>
Early versions of BCPL had the same problem, but most compilers had a %
operator which offered byte subscripting of memory, making string access
much simpler.

&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>I'm not sure it was ever fully implemented.
<p>
As far as I know, it never was.&#160;<tt> </tt>According to one of my supervisors,
writing a complete CPL compiler as part of one's B.A. degree at Cambridge
is either a guaranteed pass or a guaranteed fail, depending on who the chief
examiner is that year.
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>Further trivia is that on IBM mainframes (or at least those running Phoenix),<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>"/*" serves the same purpose as ctrl-d on a Unix system -- it terminates<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>input from the terminal. Was the adoption of this as a comment delimiter<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>an inside joke by Ritchie?<br>
<p>
I doubt it (though <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/index.html" name="dmr">DMR</a> may contradict me, of course).&#160;<tt> </tt>Every compiler I remember
using allowed both // and /* */ type comment delimiters.&#160;<tt> </tt>Some also allowed | and \ to be used instead of /, so that || was also a comment-to-end-of-line,
and \* ... *\ was an alternate block comment symbol.&#160;<tt> </tt>The latter was
particularly useful, because it could be used to comment out blocks of code
that included /* ... */ comments (as with C, comments do not nest).&#160;<tt> </tt>We used
comments with vertical bars to implement a variety of conditional compilation:
<pre>
	|**||| IF
	<i>normal code</i>
	|*|||| ELSE
	<i>alternate code</i>
	|*|||| CANCEL ELSE
	<i>more normal code</i>
	|*|||| ELSE
	<i>more alternate code</i>
	|**||| ENDIF
</pre>
By default, this would compile the "normal code".&#160;<tt> </tt>To switch to the "alternate
code", the first line was changed to |**||* or |*|||| instead.&#160;<tt> </tt>Because this
comment symbol was used, the code could contain normal comments and the
"commenting-out" reverse comments I described above.
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>the Phoenix system (layered over MVT and then MVS on the IBM 3081s and 3084s<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>at Cambridge and London)<br>
<p>
Actually, Phoenix was developed for MVT on an IBM 370-165. It was only much
later (a few weeks before I graduated) that the 3081 replaced it.
<p>
<p>
And now, with my heart in my mouth:<br>
<a href="chistory.ps">Dennis Ritchie wrote</a>:
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>With less success, they also use library procedures to specify interesting<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>control constructs such as coroutines and procedure closures.<br>
<p>
I don't know where it came from, but there was a coroutine library for BCPL
floating around the Cambridge scene. The fact that everything was just a
word made this quite easy: there was only one non-portable statement in the
entire package, to extract and replace the return address on the stack.
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>When in BCPL one writes<br>
&gt;<tt>    let V = vec 10</tt><br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>or in B,<br>
&gt;<tt>    auto V[10];</tt><br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>the effect is the same: a cell named V is allocated,
	      then another group of<br>
&gt; 10 contiguous cells is set aside,
<p>
At least in BCPL, and Mark Brader thinks also in B, the group would contain
11, and not 10, cells.
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>Individual characters in a BCPL string were usually manipulated by spreading<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>the string out into another array, one character per cell, and then repacking<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>it later; B provided corresponding routines, but people more often used other<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>library functions that accessed or replaced individual characters in a<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>string.<br>
<p>
This was true in early BCPL, and if you were writing for maximal portability,
but, as I said above, nearly all compilers provide a % operator to do byte
subscripting:
<pre>
<tt>    string = "This string ends with X"
    /* ... */
    string % (string % 0) = 'A'
</tt></pre>
This would change the last character of the string to an A.
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>For example, B introduced generalized assignment operators, using x=+y to<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>add y to x.&#160;<tt> </tt>The notation came from Algol 68
<p>
These operators were introduced into BCPL as well, using the exact notation
of Algol (x +:= y), probably by cross-fertilization from the Algol 68C compiler
work at Cambridge.
<p>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>Finally, the B and BCPL model implied overhead in dealing with pointers<br>
[...]<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>Each pointer reference generated a run-time scale conversion from the pointer<br>
&gt;&#160;<tt> </tt>to the byte address expected by the hardware.<br>
<p>
As far as I know, every real compiler for byte-addressed systems did it this
way, presumably on the assumption that arithmetic was more important than
indexing.&#160;<tt> </tt>In reality, the opposite was more often the case, and it is
surprising that no compiler generated code optimized for this, by ignoring
the two least significant bits of every word (on a 32 bit system).&#160;<tt> </tt>This would
make addresses be byte addresses, while still preserving the property that
consecutive words have addresses differing by 1 (which would be 0...0100 in
binary).&#160;<tt> </tt>The trade-off would be that the &gt;&gt; operator would
have to be implemented as a shift followed by AND-ing out the last two bits,
and the multiplication and division operators (which are relatively slow
anyway) would require their arguments (and result for division) to
be adjusted.
