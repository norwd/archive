<a name="4-1">
4.1:	Why doesn't this code:
</a></h3><p>
<pre>
	a[i] = i++;
</pre>
<p><h3>
	work?
</h3><p>
  	The subexpression <code>i++</code> causes a side effect -- it modifies <code>i</code>'s
	value -- which leads to undefined behavior if <code>i</code> is also
        referenced elsewhere in the same expression.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Note that
        although the language in K&amp;R suggests that the behavior of this
        expression is unspecified, the ANSI/ISO C Standard makes the
        stronger statement that it is undefined -- see <a href="c-5.html#5-23">question 5.23</a>.)

4.2:	Under my compiler, the code
</a></h3><p>
<pre>
	int i = 7;
	printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i++ * i++);
</pre>
<h3>
	prints 49.&#160;<tt> </tt>Regardless of the order of evaluation, shouldn't it
	print 56?
</h3><p>
  	Although the postincrement and postdecrement operators <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>
	perform the operations after yielding the former value, the
	implication of &quot;after&quot; is often misunderstood.&#160;<tt> </tt>It is <em>not</em>
	guaranteed that the operation is performed immediately after
	giving up the previous value and before any other part of the
	expression is evaluated.&#160;<tt> </tt>It is merely guaranteed that the
	update will be performed sometime before the expression is
	considered &quot;finished&quot; (before the next &quot;sequence point,&quot; in <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a>
	C's terminology).&#160;<tt> </tt>In the example, the compiler chose to
	multiply the previous value by itself and to perform both
	increments afterwards.
<p>
	The behavior of code which contains multiple, ambiguous side
	effects has always been undefined (see <a href="c-5.html#5-23">question 5.23</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
Don't even try to find out
	how your compiler implements such things (contrary to the
	ill-advised exercises in many C textbooks); as K&amp;R wisely point out,
	&quot;if you don't know <em>how</em> they are done on various machines, that
	innocence may help to protect you.&quot;

<h3><a name="4-3">
4.3:  I've experimented with the code</a>
</h3><pre>
              int i = 2;
              i = i++;
</pre><h3>
      on several compilers.&#160;<tt> </tt>Some gave i the value 2, some gave 3, but
      one gave 4.&#160;<tt> </tt>I know the behavior is undefined, but how could it
      give 4?
</h3><p>
      Undefined behavior means <em>anything</em> can happen.&#160;<tt> </tt>See <a href="c-5.html#5-23">question 5.23</a>.
<p>
<h3><a name="4-4">
4.4:  People keep saying the behavior is undefined, but I just tried
      it on an ANSI-conforming compiler, and got the results I
      expected.</a>
</h3><p>
      A compiler may do anything it likes when faced with undefined
      behavior (and, within limits, with implementation-defined and
      unspecified behavior), including doing what you expect.&#160;<tt> </tt>It's
      unwise to depend on it, though.&#160;<tt> </tt>See also <a href="c-5.html#5-18">question 5.18</a>.
<p>
<h3><a name="4-5">
4.5:  Can I use explicit parentheses to force the order of evaluation
      I want?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Even if I don't, doesn't precedence dictate it?
</h3><p>
      Operator precedence and explicit parentheses impose only a
     partial ordering on the evaluation of an expression.  Consider
     the expression
<pre>
             f() + g() * h()
</pre>
     -- although we know that the multiplication will happen before
     the addition, there is no telling which of the three functions
     will be called first.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="4-6">
4.6:	But what about the </a><code>&amp;&amp;,</code> <code>||,</code> and comma operators?
	I see code like &quot;<code>if((c = getchar()) == EOF || c == '\n')</code>&quot; ...
</h3><p>
  	There is a special exception for those operators, (as well as the <code>?:</code> operator); each of them does imply a sequence point (i.e. left-to-right evaluation is guaranteed).&#160;<tt> </tt>Any book on C should make this
	clear.

<a name="4-7">
4.7:	If I'm not using the value of the expression, should I use </a><code>i++</code>
	or <code>++i</code> to increment a variable?
</h3><p>
  	Since the two forms differ only in the value yielded, they are
	entirely equivalent when only their side effect is needed.

<a name="4-8">
4.8:	Why doesn't the code
</a></h3><p>
<pre>
	int a = 1000, b = 1000;

</pre><h3>
	work?
</h3><p>
  	Under C's integral promotion rules, the multiplication is
	carried out using <code>int</code> arithmetic, and the result may overflow
	and/or be truncated before being assigned to the <code>long int</code> left-
	hand-side.&#160;<tt> </tt>Use an explicit cast to force <code>long</code> arithmetic:
<p>
<pre>
	long int c = (long int)a * b;
</pre>
        Note that the code <code>(long int)(a * b)</code> would <em>not</em>
	have the desired effect.
