This article is a table of contents for the comp.lang.c
frequently-asked questions (FAQ) list, listing the questions
which the abridged and full versions of the FAQ list answer.
(Both lists answer all questions; the wordings of the questions
in this article are taken from the abridged list.)
<p>
If you have only just come across this article, you will
naturally be wondering where the lists which it indexes can be
found.&#160;<tt> </tt>The unabridged version is normally posted on the first of
each month, and the unabridged version twice per month, both with
Expires: lines which should keep them around all month.&#160;<tt> </tt>They can
also be found in the newsgroups comp.answers and news.answers .&#160;<tt> </tt>
Several sites archive news.answers postings and other FAQ lists,
including comp.lang.c's: two sites are rtfm.mit.edu (directories
<a href="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/C-faq/">pub/usenet/news.answers/C-faq/</a> and <a href="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/comp.lang.c/">pub/usenet/comp.lang.c/</a> ) and
<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.answers/C-faq/">ftp.uu.net (directory usenet/news.answers/C-faq/ )</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>The archie
server should help you find others; query it for &quot;prog C-faq&quot;.

Table Of Contents</h1>

<h2>1. <a name="c-1" href="c-1.html">Null Pointers</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>What is this infamous <a href="c-1.html#1-1">null pointer</a>, anyway?
<li>How do I &quot;<a href="c-1.html#1-2">get</a>&quot; a null pointer in my programs?
<li>What is <a href="c-1.html#1-3">NULL</a> and how is it #defined?
<li>How should NULL be #defined on a machine which uses a <a href="c-1.html#1-4">nonzero bit pattern</a>
as the internal representation of a null pointer?
<li>If NULL were defined as &quot;<a href="c-1.html#1-5">((char *)0)</a>,&quot; wouldn't that make function calls which pass an uncast NULL work?
<li>I use the preprocessor macro &quot;<a href="c-1.html#1-6">#define Nullptr(type) (type *)0</a>&quot; to help me build null pointers of the correct type.
<li>Is the abbreviated pointer comparison &quot;<a href="c-1.html#1-7">if(p)</a>&quot; to test for non-null pointers valid?  What if the internal representation for null pointers is nonzero?
<li>If &quot;NULL&quot; and &quot;0&quot; are equivalent, <a href="c-1.html#1-8">which should I use</a>?
<li>But wouldn't it be better to use NULL (rather than 0) in case the value of NULL <a href="c-1.html#1-9">changes</a>, perhaps on a machine with nonzero null pointers?
<li>I'm confused.  NULL is <a href="c-1.html#1-10">guaranteed to be 0</a>, but the null pointer is not?
<li>Why is there so much <a href="c-1.html#1-11">confusion</a>
surrounding null pointers?  Why do these questions come up so often?
<li>I'm still confused.  I just <a href="c-1.html#1-12">can't understand</a>
all this null pointer stuff.
<li>Given all the confusion surrounding null pointers, wouldn't it be easier simply to <a href="c-1.html#1-13">require them to be represented internally by zeroes</a>?
<li>Seriously, have any actual machines really used <a href="c-1.html#1-14">nonzero null pointers</a>?
<li>What does a run-time &quot;<a href="c-1.html#1-15">null pointer assignment</a>&quot; error mean?
</ol><p>
<h2>2. <a name="c-2" href="c-2.html">Arrays and Pointers</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>I had the definition <a href="c-2.html#2-1">char a[6]</a>
in one source file, and in another I declared&#160;<tt> </tt><a href="c-2.html#2-1">extern char *a</a>.  Why didn't it work?
<li>But I heard that char a[] was <a href="c-2.html#2-2">identical to</a>
 char *a.
<li>So what is meant by the &quot;<a href="c-2.html#2-3">equivalence of pointers and arrays</a>&quot; in C?
<li>Why are array and pointer declarations <a href="c-2.html#2-4">interchangeable as function formal parameters</a>?
<li>How can an <a href="c-2.html#2-5">array be an lvalue</a>, if you can't assign to it?
<li>Why doesn't sizeof properly report the <a href="c-2.html#2-6">size of an array</a>
which is a parameter to a function?
<li>Someone explained to me that arrays were really just <a href="c-2.html#2-7">constant pointers</a>.
<li>What is the real <a href="c-2.html#2-8">difference between arrays and pointers</a>?
<li>I came across some &quot;joke&quot; code containing the &quot;expression&quot; <a href="c-2.html#2-9">5[&quot;abcdef&quot;]</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
How can this be legal C?
<li>My compiler complained when I passed a <a href="c-2.html#2-10">two-dimensional array</a>
to a routine expecting a pointer to a pointer.
<li>How do I write functions which accept 2-dimensional arrays when the <a href="c-2.html#2-11">&quot;width&quot; is not known at compile time</a>?
<li>How do I declare a <a href="c-2.html#2-12">pointer to an array</a>?
<li>What's the <a href="c-2.html#2-13">difference between array and &amp;array</a>?
<li>How can I <a href="c-2.html#2-14">dynamically allocate</a>
a multidimensional array?
<li>How can I use <a href="c-2.html#2-15">statically- and dynamically-allocated multidimensional arrays interchangeably</a>
when passing them to functions?
<li>Can I simulate a <a href="c-2.html#2-16">non-0-based array</a>
with a pointer?
<li>I passed a pointer to a function which initialized it, but the <a href="c-2.html#2-17">pointer in the caller</a> was unchanged.
<li>I have a char * pointer that happens to point to some ints, and I want to step it over them.  Why doesn't &quot;<a href="c-2.html#2-18">((int *)p)++;</a>&quot; work?
<li>Can I use a void ** pointer to pass a <a href="c-2.html#2-19">generic pointer</a>
to a function by reference?

</ol><p>
<h2>3. <a name="c-3" href="c-3.html">Memory Allocation</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Why doesn't the code &quot;<a href="c-3.html#3-1">char *answer; gets(answer);</a>&quot; work?
<li>I can't get strcat to work.  I tried &quot;<a href="c-3.html#3-2">char *s1 = &quot;Hello, &quot;, *s2 = &quot;world!&quot;, *s3 = strcat(s1, s2);</a>&quot; but I got strange results.
<li>But the man page for strcat says that it takes two char *'s as arguments.&#160;<tt> </tt>
How am I supposed to know to <a href="c-3.html#3-3">allocate</a> things?
<li>I have a function that is supposed to return a string, but when it returns to its caller, the <a href="c-3.html#3-4">returned string is garbage</a>.
<li>Why does some code carefully <a href="c-3.html#3-5">cast the values returned by malloc</a>
to the pointer type being allocated?
<li>You can't <a href="c-3.html#3-6">use dynamically-allocated memory after you free it</a>, can you?
<li>How does free() know <a href="c-3.html#3-7">how many bytes</a>
to free?
<li>So can I query the malloc package to <a href="c-3.html#3-8">find out</a>
how big an allocated block is?
<li>When I free a dynamically-allocated structure containing pointers, do I have to free each subsidiary pointer <a href="c-3.html#3-9">first</a>?
<li>Why doesn't my program's <a href="c-3.html#3-10">memory usage</a>
go down when I free memory?
<li>Must I free allocated memory before the program <a href="c-3.html#3-11">exits</a>?
<li>Is it legal to pass a null pointer as the <a href="c-3.html#3-12">first argument to realloc()</a>?
<li>Is it safe to use calloc's <a href="c-3.html#3-13">zero-fill guarantee for pointer and floating-point values</a>?
<li>What is <a href="c-3.html#3-14">alloca</a>
and why is its use discouraged?

</ol><p><h2>4. <a name="c-4" href="c-4.html">Expressions</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Why doesn't the code &quot;<a href="c-4.html#4-1">a[i] = i++;</a>&quot; work?
<li>Under my compiler, the code &quot;int i = 7; printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i++ * i++);&quot; prints 49.  Regardless of the order of evaluation, <a href="c-4.html#4-2">shouldn't it print 56</a>?
<li>How could the code &quot;<a href="c-4.html#4-3">int i = 2; i = i++;</a>&quot; ever give 4?
<li>I just tried some allegedly-<a href="c-4.html#4-4">undefined</a>
code on an ANSI-conforming compiler, and got the results I expected.
<li>Don't precedence and parentheses dictate <a href="c-4.html#4-5">order of evaluation</a>?
<li>But what about the <a href="c-4.html#4-6">&amp;&amp;, ||, and comma</a>
operators?
<li>If I'm not using the value of the expression, should I use <a href="c-4.html#4-7">i++ or ++i</a>
to increment a variable?
<li>Why doesn't the code &quot;<a href="c-4.html#4-8">int a = 1000, b = 1000; long int c = a * b;</a>&quot; work?

</ol><p><h2>5. <a name="c-5" href="c-5.html">ANSI C</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="c-5.html#5-1">What is</a>
the &quot;ANSI C Standard?&quot;
<li>How can I <a href="c-5.html#5-2">get a copy</a>
of the Standard?
<li>Does anyone have a tool for <a href="c-5.html#5-3">converting old-style C programs to ANSI C</a>, or for automatically generating prototypes?
<li>How do I keep the ANSI &quot;<a href="c-5.html#5-4">stringizing</a>&quot; preprocessing operator from stringizing the macro's name rather than its value?
<li>Why can't I use <a href="c-5.html#5-5">const values in initializers</a>
and array dimensions?
<li>What's the difference between &quot;<a href="c-5.html#5-6">char const *p&quot; and &quot;char * const p</a>&quot;?
<li>Why can't I pass a char ** to a function which expects a <a href="c-5.html#5-7">const char **</a>?
<li>My ANSI compiler complains about a <a href="c-5.html#5-8">mismatch</a>
when it sees
<br><br>
  	extern int func(float);<br>
<br>
       	int func(x)<br>
       	float x;<br>
        {...<br>
<br>
<li>Can you <a href="c-5.html#5-9">mix old-style and new-style</a>
function syntax?
<li>Why does the declaration &quot;<a href="c-5.html#5-10">extern f(struct x {int s;} *p);</a>&quot; give me a warning message?
<li>I'm getting strange syntax errors inside code which I've <a href="c-5.html#5-11">#ifdeffed out</a>.
<li>Can I <a href="c-5.html#5-12">declare main as void</a>, to shut off these annoying &quot;main returns no value&quot; messages?
<li>Is <a href="c-5.html#5-13">exit(status)</a>
truly equivalent to returning status from main?
<li>Why does the ANSI Standard not guarantee more than <a href="c-5.html#5-14">six monocase characters of external identifier</a>
significance?
<li>What is the difference between <a href="c-5.html#5-15">memcpy and memmove</a>?
<li>My compiler is rejecting the simplest possible test programs, with <a href="c-5.html#5-16">all kinds</a>
of syntax errors.
<li>Why are some ANSI/ISO Standard <a href="c-5.html#5-17">library routines</a>
showing up as undefined, even though I've got an ANSI compiler?
