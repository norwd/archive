<a name="16-1">
16.1:	How can I read a single character from the keyboard without
	waiting for a newline?
</a></h3><p>
  	Contrary to popular belief and many people's wishes, this is not
	a C-related question.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Nor are closely-related questions
	concerning the echo of keyboard input.)&#160;<tt> </tt>The delivery of
	characters from a &quot;keyboard&quot; to a C program is a function of the
	operating system in use, and has not been standardized by the C
	language.&#160;<tt> </tt>Some versions of curses have a cbreak() function
	        which does what you want.  If you're specifically trying to read
        a short password without echo, you might try<code> getpass()</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>Under
        Unix, use<code> ioctl </code>to play with the terminal driver modes (<code>CBREAK </code>or<code> RAW </code>under "classic" versions;<code> ICANON</code>,<code> c_cc[VMIN] </code>and
<code>        c_cc[VTIME] </code>under System V or Posix systems).  Under MS-DOS, use
<code>        getch()</code>.  Under VMS, try the Screen Management (<code>SMG$</code>) routines,
        or curses, or issue low-level<code> $QIO</code>'s with the<code> IO$_READVBLK </code>(and
        perhaps<code> IO$M_NOECHO</code>) function codes to ask for one character at
        a time.  Under other operating systems, you're on your own.
        Beware that some operating systems make this sort of thing
        impossible, because character collection into input lines is
        done by peripheral processors not under direct control of the
        CPU running your program.
<p>
	Operating system specific questions are not appropriate for
	comp.lang.c .&#160;<tt> </tt>Many common questions are answered in
	frequently-asked questions postings in such groups as
	comp.unix.questions and comp.os.msdos.programmer .&#160;<tt> </tt>Note that
	the answers are often not unique even across different variants
	of a system; bear in mind when answering system-specific
	questions that the answer that applies to your system may not
	apply to everyone else's.

<a name="16-2">
16.2:	How can I find out if there are characters available for reading
	(and if so, how many)?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Alternatively, how can I do a read that
	will not block if there are no characters available?
</h3><p>
  	These, too, are entirely operating-system-specific.&#160;<tt> </tt>Some
	versions of curses have a<code> nodelay() </code>function.&#160;<tt> </tt>Depending on your
	system, you may also be able to use &quot;nonblocking I/O&quot;, or a
	system call named &quot;select&quot;, or the<code> FIONREAD</code><code> ioctl</code>, or<code> kbhit()</code>,
	or<code> rdchk()</code>, or the<code> O_NDELAY </code>option to<code> open() </code>or<code> fcntl()</code>.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="16-3">
16.3:	How can I clear the screen?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>How can I print things in inverse
	video?
</h3><p>
  	Such things depend on the terminal type (or display) you're
	using.&#160;<tt> </tt>You will have to use a library such as<code> termcap </code>or
	<code>curses</code>, or some system-specific routines, to perform these
	functions.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="16-4">
16.4:	How do I read the mouse?
</a></h3><p>
  	Consult your system documentation, or ask on an appropriate
	system-specific newsgroup (but check its FAQ list first).&#160;<tt> </tt>Mouse
	handling is completely different under the X window system, MS-
	DOS, Macintosh, and probably every other system.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="16-5">
16.5:	How can my program discover the complete pathname to the
	executable file from which it was invoked?
</a></h3><p>
  	<code>argv[0] </code>may contain all or part of the pathname, or it may
	contain nothing.&#160;<tt> </tt>You may be able to duplicate the command
	language interpreter's search path logic to locate the
	executable if the name in<code> argv[0] </code>is present but incomplete.
	However, there is no guaranteed or portable solution.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="16-6">
16.6:	How can a process change an environment variable in its caller?
</a></h3><p>
  	In general, it cannot.&#160;<tt> </tt>Different operating systems implement
	name/value functionality similar to the Unix environment in
	different ways.&#160;<tt> </tt>Whether the &quot;environment&quot; can be usefully
	altered by a running program, and if so, how, is system-dependent.
<p>
	Under Unix, a process can modify its own environment (some
	systems provide<code> setenv() </code>and/or<code> putenv() </code>functions to do this),
	and the modified environment is usually passed on to any child
	processes, but it is <em>not</em> propagated back to the parent
	process.
<p>
<h3><a name="16-7">
16.7:   How can I check whether a file exists?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>I want to query
	the user before overwriting existing files.
</h3><p>
        On Unix-like systems, you can try the<code> access() </code>routine, although it's got a few
        problems.&#160;<tt> </tt>(It isn't atomic with respect to the following
        action, and can have anomalies if used in setuid programs.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
	Another option (perhaps preferable) is to call
	<code>stat()</code> on the file.&#160;<tt> </tt>Otherwise, the only
	guaranteed and portable way to test for file existence is to try
	opening the file (which doesn't help if you're trying to avoid
	overwriting an existing file, unless you've got something like the
	BSD Unix <code>O_EXCL</code> <code>open</code> option available).
<h3>
<a name="16-8">
16.8:	How can I find out the size of a file, prior to reading it in?
</a></h3><p>
  	If the &quot;size of a file&quot; is the number of characters you'll be
	able to read from it in C, it is in general impossible to
	determine this number in advance.&#160;<tt> </tt>Under Unix, the<code> stat </code>call
	will give you an exact answer, and several other systems supply
	a Unix-like<code> stat </code>which will give an approximate answer.&#160;<tt> </tt>You can
	<code>fseek </code>to the end and then use<code> ftell</code>, but this usage is
	nonportable (it gives you an accurate answer only under Unix,
	and otherwise a quasi-accurate answer only for <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> C &quot;binary&quot;
	files).&#160;<tt> </tt>Some systems provide routines called<code> filesize </code>or
<code>       filelength</code>.
<p>
	Are you sure you have to determine the file's size in advance?
	Since the most accurate way of determining the size of a file as
	a C program will see it is to open the file and read it, perhaps
	you can rearrange the code to learn the size as it reads.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="16-9">
16.9:	How can a file be shortened in-place without completely clearing
	or rewriting it?
</a></h3><p>
  	BSD systems provide<code> ftruncate()</code>, several others supply<code> chsize()</code>,
	and a few may provide a (possibly undocumented)<code> fcntl </code>option
	<code>F_FREESP</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>Under MS-DOS, you can sometimes use<code> write(fd, &quot;&quot;, 0)</code>.
	However, there is no truly portable solution.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="16-10">
16.10:	How can I implement a delay, or time a user's response, with
	sub-second resolution?
</a></h3><p>
  	Unfortunately, there is no portable way.&#160;<tt> </tt>V7 Unix, and derived
	systems, provided a fairly useful<code> ftime() </code>routine with
	resolution up to a millisecond, but it has disappeared from
	System V and Posix.&#160;<tt> </tt>Other routines you might look for on your
	system include<code> nap()</code>,<code> setitimer()</code>,<code> msleep()</code>,<code> usleep()</code>,<code> clock()</code>,
	and<code> gettimeofday()</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>The<code> select() </code>and<code> poll() </code>calls (if
	available) can be pressed into service to implement simple
	delays.&#160;<tt> </tt>On MS-DOS machines, it is possible to reprogram the
	system timer and timer interrupts.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="16-11">
16.11:	How can I read in an object file and jump to routines in it?
</a></h3><p>
  	You want a dynamic linker and/or loader.&#160;<tt> </tt>It is possible to
	<code>malloc </code>some space and read in object files, but you have to know
	an awful lot about object file formats, relocation, etc.&#160;<tt> </tt>Under
	BSD Unix, you could use<code> system() </code>and<code> ld -A </code>to do the linking for
	you.&#160;<tt> </tt>Many (most?) versions of SunOS and System V have the<code> -ldl</code>
	library which allows object files to be dynamically loaded.
	There is also a GNU package called &quot;dld&quot;.&#160;<tt> </tt>See also <a href="c-7.html#7-6">question
	7.6</a>.

<h3><a name="16-12">
16.12:  How can I invoke an operating system command from within a
        program?</a></h3>
<p>
        Use<code> system()</code>.

<p>
<h3>
<a name="16-13">
16.13:	How can I invoke an operating system command and trap its output?</a>
</h3><p>
  	Unix and some other systems provide a<code> popen() </code>routine, which
	sets up a<code> stdio </code>stream on a pipe connected to the process
	running a command, so that the output can be read (or the input
	supplied).&#160;<tt> </tt>Alternately, invoke the command simply (see
	<a href="c-16.html#16-12">question 16.12</a>) in such a way that
	it writes its output to a file, then open and read that file.

<h3>
<a name="16-14">
16.14:	How can I read a directory in a C program?
</a></h3><p>
  	See if you can use the<code> opendir() </code>and<code> readdir() </code>routines, which
	are available on most Unix systems.&#160;<tt> </tt>Implementations also exist
	for MS-DOS, VMS, and other systems.&#160;<tt> </tt>(MS-DOS also has<code> FINDFIRST </code>and<code> FINDNEXT </code>routines which do essentially the same thing.)

<p>
<h3>
<a name="16-15">
16.15:  How can I do serial (&quot;comm&quot;) port I/O?
</a></h3><p>
It's system-dependent.&#160;<tt> </tt>Under Unix, you typically open, read,
        and write a device in <code>/dev</code>, and use the facilities of the
        terminal driver to adjust its characteristics.&#160;<tt> </tt>Under MS-DOS,
        you can either use some primitive BIOS interrupts, or (if you
        require decent performance) one of any number of interrupt-driven
serial I/O packages.
