	   +---+---+---+---+---+---+

	p: |  *======&gt; | w | o | r | l | d |\0 |
	   +-----+     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
</pre>
<p>
	It is important to realize that a reference like <code>x[3]</code> generates
	different code depending on whether <code>x</code> is an array or a pointer.
	Given the declarations above, when the compiler sees the
	expression <code>a[3]</code>, it emits code to start at the location &quot;a,&quot;
	move three past it, and fetch the character there.&#160;<tt> </tt>When it sees
	the expression <code>p[3]</code>, it emits code to start at the location &quot;p,&quot;
	fetch the pointer value there, add three to the pointer, and
	finally fetch the character pointed to.&#160;<tt> </tt>In the example above,
	both <code>a[3]</code> and <code>p[3]</code> happen to be the character <code>'l'</code>, but the
	compiler gets there differently.&#160;<tt> </tt>(See also questions <a href="c-17.html#17-19">17.19</a> and <a href="c-17.html#17-20">17.20</a>.)

<h3>
<a name="2-3">
2.3:	So what is meant by the &quot;equivalence of pointers and arrays&quot; in
	C?</a></h3>
<p>
  	Much of the confusion surrounding pointers in C can be traced to
	a misunderstanding of this statement.&#160;<tt> </tt>Saying that arrays and
	pointers are &quot;equivalent&quot; neither means that they are identical
	nor even interchangeable.
<p>
	&quot;Equivalence&quot; refers to the following key definition:
<blockquote>
		An lvalue [see <a href="c-2.html#2-5">question 2.5</a>] of type array-of-T
		which appears in an expression decays (with
		three exceptions) into a pointer to its first
		element; the type of the resultant pointer is
		pointer-to-T.
</blockquote>
	(The exceptions are when the array is the operand of a <code>sizeof</code> or
	<code>&amp;</code> operator, or is a literal string initializer for a character
	array.)
<p>
	As a consequence of this definition, there is no apparent
	difference in the behavior of the &quot;array subscripting&quot; operator
	<code>[]</code> as it applies to arrays and pointers.&#160;<tt> </tt>In an expression of
	the form <code>a[i]</code>, the array reference &quot;<code>a</code>&quot; decays into a pointer,
	following the rule above, and is then subscripted just as would
	be a pointer variable in the expression <code>p[i]</code> (although the
	eventual memory accesses will be different, as explained in
	<a href="c-2.html#2-2">question 2.2</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>In either case, the expression <code>x[i]</code> (where <code>x</code> is
	an array or a pointer) is, by definition, identical to <code>*((x)+(i))</code>.

<h3>
<a name="2-4">
2.4:	Then why are array and pointer declarations interchangeable as
	function formal parameters?</a></h3>
<p>
  	Since arrays decay immediately into pointers, an array is never
	actually passed to a function.&#160;<tt> </tt>As a convenience, any parameter
	declarations which &quot;look like&quot; arrays, e.g.
<p>
<pre>
	f(a)
	char a[];
</pre>
<p>
	are treated by the compiler as if they were pointers, since that
	is what the function will receive if an array is passed:
<p>
<pre>
	f(a)
	char *a;
</pre>
<p>
	This conversion holds only within function formal parameter
	declarations, nowhere else.&#160;<tt> </tt>If this conversion bothers you,
	avoid it; many people have concluded that the confusion it
	causes outweighs the small advantage of having the declaration
	&quot;look like&quot; the call and/or the uses within the function.

2.5:	How can an array be an lvalue, if you can't assign to it?</a></h3>

<h3>
<a name="2-6">
2.6:	Why doesn't sizeof properly report the size of an array which is
	a parameter to a function?</a></h3>
<p>
  	The sizeof operator reports the size of the pointer parameter
	which the function actually receives (see <a href="c-2.html#2-4">question 2.4</a>).
<p>

<h3>
<a name="2-7">
2.7:	Someone explained to me that arrays were really just constant
	pointers.</a></h3>
<p>
  	This is a bit of an oversimplification.&#160;<tt> </tt>An array name is
	&quot;constant&quot; in that it cannot be assigned to, but an array is
	<em>not</em> a pointer, as the discussion and pictures in <a href="c-2.html#2-2">question 2.2</a>
	should make clear.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="2-8">
2.8:	Practically speaking, what is the difference between arrays and
	pointers?</a></h3>
<p>
  	Arrays automatically allocate space, but can't be relocated or
	resized.&#160;<tt> </tt>Pointers must be explicitly assigned to point to
	allocated space (perhaps using malloc), but can be reassigned
	(i.e. pointed at different objects) at will, and have many other
	uses besides serving as the base of blocks of memory.
<p>
        Due to the so-called equivalence of arrays and pointers (see
        <a href="c-2.html#2-3">question 2.3</a>), arrays and pointers often seem interchangeable,
        and in particular a pointer to a block of memory assigned by
        <code> malloc </code>is frequently treated (and can be referenced using<code> [] </code>exactly) as if it were a true array.  (See <a href="c-2.html#2-14">question 2.14</a>; see
        also <a href="c-17.html#17-20">question 17.20</a>.)

<p>
  	Yes, Virginia, array subscripting is commutative in C.&#160;<tt> </tt>This
	curious fact follows from the pointer definition of array
	subscripting, namely that <code>a[e]</code> is identical to <code>*((a)+(e))</code>, for
	<em>any</em> expression e and primary expression a, as long as one of
	them is a pointer expression and one is integral.&#160;<tt> </tt>This
	unsuspected commutativity is often mentioned in C texts as if it
	were something to be proud of, but it finds no useful
	application outside of the Obfuscated C Contest (see <a href="c-17.html#17-13">question

<h3>
<a name="2-10">
2.10:	My compiler complained when I passed a two-dimensional array to
	a routine expecting a pointer to a pointer.</a></h3>
<p>
  	The rule by which arrays decay into pointers is not applied
	recursively.&#160;<tt> </tt>An array of arrays (i.e. a two-dimensional array
	in C) decays into a pointer to an array, not a pointer to a
	pointer.&#160;<tt> </tt>Pointers to arrays can be confusing, and must be
	treated carefully.&#160;<tt> </tt>(The confusion is heightened by the
	existence of incorrect compilers, including some versions of pcc
	and pcc-derived lint's, which improperly accept assignments of
	multi-dimensional arrays to multi-level pointers.)&#160;<tt> </tt>If you are
	passing a two-dimensional array to a function:
<p>
<pre>
	int array[NROWS][NCOLUMNS];
	f(array);
</pre>
<p>
	the function's declaration should match:
<p>
<pre>
	f(int a[][NCOLUMNS]) {...}
</pre>
	or
<pre>
	f(int (*ap)[NCOLUMNS]) {...}   /* ap is a pointer to an array */
</pre>
<p>
	In the first declaration, the compiler performs the usual
	implicit parameter rewriting of &quot;array of array&quot; to &quot;pointer to
	array;&quot; in the second form the pointer declaration is explicit.
	Since the called function does not allocate space for the array,
	it does not need to know the overall size, so the number of
	&quot;rows,&quot; NROWS, can be omitted.&#160;<tt> </tt>The &quot;shape&quot; of the array is
	still important, so the &quot;column&quot; dimension NCOLUMNS (and, for 3-
	or more dimensional arrays, the intervening ones) must be
	included.
<p>
	If a function is already declared as accepting a pointer to a
	pointer, it is probably incorrect to pass a two-dimensional
	array directly to it.

<h3>
<a name="2-11">
2.11:	How do I write functions which accept 2-dimensional arrays when
	the &quot;width&quot; is not known at compile time?</a></h3>
<p>
  	It's not easy.&#160;<tt> </tt>One way is to pass in a pointer to the <code>[0][0]</code>
	element, along with the two dimensions, and simulate array
	subscripting &quot;by hand:&quot;
<p>
<pre>
	f2(aryp, nrows, ncolumns)
	int *aryp;
	int nrows, ncolumns;
	{ ... ary[i][j] is really aryp[i * ncolumns + j] ... }
</pre>
<p>
	This function could be called with the array from <a href="c-2.html#2-10">question 2.10</a>
	as
<p>
<pre>
	f2(&amp;array[0][0], NROWS, NCOLUMNS);
</pre>
<p>
	It must be noted, however, that a program which performs
	multidimensional array subscripting &quot;by hand&quot; in this way is not
	in strict conformance with the <a href="index.html#ANSI">ANSI</a> C Standard; the behavior of
	accessing <code>(&amp;array[0][0])[x]</code> is not defined for <code>x &gt; NCOLUMNS</code>.
<p>
        gcc allows local arrays to be declared having sizes which are
	specified by a function's arguments, but this is a nonstandard
	extension.

<h3>
<a name="2-12">
2.12:	How do I declare a pointer to an array?</a></h3>
<p>
  	Usually, you don't want to.&#160;<tt> </tt>When people speak casually of a
	pointer to an array, they usually mean a pointer to its first
	element.
<p>
	Instead of a pointer to an array, consider using a pointer to
	one of the array's elements.&#160;<tt> </tt>Arrays of type T decay into
	pointers to type T (see <a href="c-2.html#2-3">question 2.3</a>), which is convenient;
	subscripting or incrementing the resultant pointer accesses the
	individual members of the array.&#160;<tt> </tt>True pointers to arrays, when
	subscripted or incremented, step over entire arrays, and are
	generally only useful when operating on arrays of arrays, if at
	all.&#160;<tt> </tt>(See <a href="c-2.html#2-10">question 2.10</a> above.)
<p>
	If you really need to declare a pointer to an entire array, use
	something like &quot;<code>int (*ap)[N];</code>&quot; where <code>N</code> is the size of the array.
	(See also <a href="c-10.html#10-4">question 10.4</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>If the size of the array is unknown,
	<code>N</code> can be omitted, but the resulting type, &quot;pointer to array of
	unknown size,&quot; is useless.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="2-13">2.13:   Since array references decay to pointers, given</a></h3>
<pre>
                int array[NROWS][NCOLUMNS];
</pre><h3>
        what's the difference between<code> array </code>and<code> &amp;array</code>?
</h3><p>
        Under ANSI/ISO Standard C, &amp;array yields a pointer, of type
        pointer-to-array-of-T, to the entire array (see also <a href="c-2.html#2-12">question 2.12</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
Under pre-ANSI C, the &amp; in<code> &amp;array </code>generally elicited a
        warning, and was generally ignored.&#160;<tt> </tt>Under all C compilers, an
        unadorned reference to an array yields a pointer, of type
        pointer-to-T, to the array's first element.  (See also <a href="c-2.html#2-3">question 2.3</a>.)
<p>
<h3>
<a name="2-14">
2.14:	How can I dynamically allocate a multidimensional array?</a></h3>
<p>
  	It is usually best to allocate an array of pointers, and then
	initialize each pointer to a dynamically-allocated &quot;row.&quot;&#160;<tt> </tt>Here
	is a two-dimensional example:
<p>
<pre>
	int **array1 = (int **)malloc(nrows * sizeof(int *));
	for(i = 0; i &lt; nrows; i++)
		array1[i] = (int *)malloc(ncolumns * sizeof(int));
</pre>
<p>
	(In &quot;real&quot; code, of course, malloc would be declared correctly,
	and each return value checked.)
<p>
	You can keep the array's contents contiguous, while making later
	reallocation of individual rows difficult, with a bit of
	explicit pointer arithmetic:
<p>
<pre>
	int **array2 = (int **)malloc(nrows * sizeof(int *));
	array2[0] = (int *)malloc(nrows * ncolumns * sizeof(int));
	for(i = 1; i &lt; nrows; i++)
		array2[i] = array2[0] + i * ncolumns;
</pre>
<p>
	In either case, the elements of the dynamic array can be
	accessed with normal-looking array subscripts: <code>array[i][j]</code>.
<p>
	If the double indirection implied by the above schemes is for
	some reason unacceptable, you can simulate a two-dimensional
	array with a single, dynamically-allocated one-dimensional
	array:
<p>
<pre>
	   int *array3 = (int *)malloc(nrows * ncolumns * sizeof(int));
</pre>
<p>
	However, you must now perform subscript calculations manually,
	accessing the i,jth element with <code>array3[i * ncolumns + j]</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>(A
	macro can hide the explicit calculation, but invoking it then
	requires parentheses and commas which don't look exactly like
	multidimensional array subscripts.)
<p>
	Finally, you can use pointers-to-arrays:
<p>
<pre>
	int (*array4)[NCOLUMNS] =
		(int (*)[NCOLUMNS])malloc(nrows * sizeof(*array4));
</pre>
<p>
	, but the syntax gets horrific and all but one dimension must be
	known at compile time.
<p>
	With all of these techniques, you may of course need to remember
	to free the arrays (which may take several steps; see <a href="c-3.html#3-9">question
	3.9</a>) when they are no longer needed, and you cannot necessarily
	intermix the dynamically-allocated arrays with conventional,
	statically-allocated ones (see <a href="c-2.html#2-15">question 2.15</a> below, and also
	question <a href="c-2.html#2-10">2.10</a>).
<p>

<h3>
<a name="2-15">
2.15:	How can I use statically- and dynamically-allocated
	multidimensional arrays interchangeably when passing them to
	functions?</a></h3>
<p>
  	There is no single perfect method.&#160;<tt> </tt>Given the declarations
<pre>
        int array[NROWS][NCOLUMNS];
        int **array1;
        int **array2;
        int *array3;
        int (*array4)[NCOLUMNS];
</pre>
	as initialized in the code fragments in questions <a href="c-2.html#2-10">2.10</a> and <a href="c-2.html#2-14">2.14</a>,
	and functions declared as
<pre>
        f1(int a[][NCOLUMNS], int m, int n);
        f2(int *aryp, int nrows, int ncolumns);
        f3(int **pp, int m, int n);
</pre>
	(see questions <a href="c-2.html#2-10">2.10</a> and <a href="c-2.html#2-11">2.11</a>),
	the following calls should work as expected:
<pre>
	f1(array, NROWS, NCOLUMNS);
	f1(array4, nrows, NCOLUMNS);
	f2(&amp;array[0][0], NROWS, NCOLUMNS);
	f2(*array2, nrows, ncolumns);
	f2(array3, nrows, ncolumns);
	f2(*array4, nrows, NCOLUMNS);
	f3(array1, nrows, ncolumns);
	f3(array2, nrows, ncolumns);
</pre>
<p>
	The following two calls would probably work, but involve
	questionable casts, and work only if the dynamic ncolumns
	matches the static <code>NCOLUMNS</code>:
<p>
<pre>
	f1((int (*)[NCOLUMNS])(*array2), nrows, ncolumns);
	f1((int (*)[NCOLUMNS])array3, nrows, ncolumns);
</pre>
<p>
	It must again be noted that passing<code> &amp;array[0][0] </code>to<code> f2() </code>is not
	strictly conforming; see <a href="c-2.html#2-11">question 2.11</a>.
<p>
	If you can understand why all of the above calls work and are
	written as they are, and if you understand why the combinations
	that are not listed would not work, then you have a <em>very</em> good
	understanding of arrays and pointers (and several other areas)
	in C.

      Although this technique is attractive (and was used in old

      conform to the C standards.  Pointer arithmetic is defined only
      as long as the pointer points within the same allocated block of
      memory, or to the imaginary "terminating" element one past it;
      otherwise, the behavior is undefined, <em>even if the pointer is
      not dereferenced</em>.  The code above could fail if, while
      subtracting the offset, an illegal address were generated
      (perhaps because the address tried to "wrap around" past the
      beginning of some memory segment).

<h3><a name="2-19">2.19: Can I use a</a><code> void</code> <code>** </code>pointer to pass a generic pointer to a
      function by reference?
</h3>
      Not portably.  There is no generic pointer-to-pointer type in C.
      <code> void</code> <code>* </code>acts as a generic pointer only because conversions are
      applied automatically when other pointer types are assigned to
      and from<code> void</code> <code>*</code>'s; these conversions cannot be performed (the
      correct underlying pointer type is not known) if an attempt is
      made to indirect upon a<code> void</code> <code>** </code>value which points at something
      other than a<code> void</code> <code>*</code>.
