<h2>Section 17. Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
<h3>
<a name="17-1">
17.1:	What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables
	which are not explicitly initialized?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>If global variables start
	out as &quot;zero,&quot; is that good enough for null pointers and
	floating-point zeroes?
</h3><p>
  	Variables with &quot;static&quot; duration (that is, those declared
	outside of functions, and those declared with the storage class
	<code>static</code>), are guaranteed initialized to zero, as if the
	programmer had typed &quot;<code>= 0</code>&quot;.&#160;<tt> </tt>Therefore, such variables are
	initialized to the null pointer (of the correct type; see also
	<a href="c-1.html">Section 1</a>) if they are pointers, and to <code>0.0</code> if they are
	floating-point.
<p>
	Variables with &quot;automatic&quot; duration (i.e. local variables
	without the <code>static</code> storage class) start out containing garbage,
	unless they are explicitly initialized.&#160;<tt> </tt>Nothing useful can be
	predicted about the garbage.
<p>
	Dynamically-allocated memory obtained with <code>malloc</code> and <code>realloc</code> is
	also likely to contain garbage, and must be initialized by the
	calling program, as appropriate.&#160;<tt> </tt>Memory obtained with <code>calloc</code>
	contains all-bits-0, but this is not necessarily useful for
	pointer or floating-point values (see <a href="c-3.html#3-13">question 3.13</a>, and <a href="c-1.html">section 1</a>).
<p><h3>
<a name="17-2">
17.2:   This code, straight out of a book, isn't compiling:</a></h3>
<pre>
        f()
        {
        char a[] = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;
        }
</pre>
        Perhaps you have a pre-ANSI compiler, which doesn't allow
        initialization of "automatic aggregates" (i.e. non-static local
        arrays and structures).&#160;<tt> </tt>As a workaround, you can make the array
        global or static, and initialize it with <code>strcpy</code> when
	<code>f</code> is called.&#160;<tt> </tt>(You can always initialize local
	<code>char</code> <code>* </code>variables with string literals,
	but see question <a href="c-17.html#17-20">17.20</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>See
        also questions <a href="c-5.html#5-16">5.16</a>
and <a href="c-5.html#5-17">5.17</a>.

<h3>
<a name="17-3">
17.3:	How can I write data files which can be read on other machines
	with different word size, byte order, or floating point formats?
</a></h3><p>
  	The best solution is to use text files (usually ASCII), written
	with <code>fprintf</code> and read with <code>fscanf</code> or the like.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Similar advice
	also applies to network protocols.)&#160;<tt> </tt>Be skeptical of arguments
	which imply that text files are too big, or that reading and
	writing them is too slow.&#160;<tt> </tt>Not only is their efficiency
	frequently acceptable in practice, but the advantages of being
	able to manipulate them with standard tools can be overwhelming.
<p>
	If you must use a binary format, you can improve portability,
	and perhaps take advantage of prewritten I/O libraries, by
	making use of standardized formats such as Sun's XDR (RFC 1014),
	OSI's ASN.1, CCITT's X.409, or ISO 8825 &quot;Basic Encoding Rules.&quot;
	See also <a href="c-9.html#9-11">question 9.11</a>.
<p>
<h3><a name="17-4">
17.4:   How can I insert or delete a line (or record) from the middle of a file?</a></h3>
<p>
        Short of rewriting the file, you probably can't.&#160;<tt> </tt>See also
        question <a href="c-16.html#16-9">16.9</a>.
<p><h3>
<a name="17-5">
17.5:	How can I return several values from a function?
</a></h3><p>
  	Either pass pointers to locations which the function can fill
	in, or have the function return a structure containing the
	desired values, or (in a pinch) consider global variables.&#160;<tt> </tt>See
	also questions <a href="c-2.html#2-17">2.17</a>, <a href="c-3.html#3-4">3.4</a>, and <a href="c-9.html#9-2">9.2</a>.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="17-6">
17.6:	If I have a </a><code>char</code> <code>*</code> variable pointing to the name of a function
	as a string, how can I call that function?
</h3><p>
  	The most straightforward thing to do is maintain a
	correspondence table of names and function pointers:
<p>
<pre>
	int function1(), function2();

	struct {char *name; int (*funcptr)(); } symtab[] =
		{
		&quot;function1&quot;,	function1,
		&quot;function2&quot;,	function2,
		};
</pre>
<p>
	Then, just search the table for the name, and call through the
	associated function pointer.&#160;<tt> </tt>See also questions <a href="c-9.html#9-9">9.9</a> and <a href="c-16.html#16-11">16.11</a>.

<h3>
<a name="17-7">
17.7:	I seem to be missing the system header file </a><code>&lt;sgtty.h&gt;</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>Can
	someone send me a copy?
</h3><p>
  	Standard headers exist in part so that definitions appropriate
	to your compiler, operating system, and processor can be
	supplied.&#160;<tt> </tt>You cannot just pick up a copy of someone else's
	header file and expect it to work, unless that person is using
	exactly the same environment.&#160;<tt> </tt>Ask your compiler vendor why the
	file was not provided (or to send a replacement copy).
<p>

<h3>
<a name="17-8">
17.8:	How can I call FORTRAN (C++, BASIC, Pascal, Ada, LISP) functions
	from C?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>(And vice versa?)
</h3><p>
  	The answer is entirely dependent on the machine and the specific
	calling sequences of the various compilers in use, and may not
	be possible at all.&#160;<tt> </tt>Read your compiler documentation very
	carefully; sometimes there is a &quot;mixed-language programming
	guide,&quot; although the techniques for passing arguments and
	ensuring correct run-time startup are often arcane.&#160;<tt> </tt>More
	information may be found in <a href="ftp://suphys.physics.su.oz.au/src/FORT.gz">FORT.gz</a> by Glenn Geers, available via
	anonymous ftp from suphys.physics.su.oz.au in the src directory.
<p>
	<a href="ftp://zebra.desy.de/cfortran">cfortran.h</a>, a C header file, simplifies C/FORTRAN interfacing on
	many popular machines.&#160;<tt> </tt>It is available via anonymous ftp from
	zebra.desy.de (131.169.2.244).
<p>
	In C++, a &quot;C&quot; modifier in an external function declaration
	indicates that the function is to be called using C calling
	conventions.

17.9:	Does anyone know of a program for converting Pascal or FORTRAN
	(or LISP, Ada, awk, &quot;Old&quot; C, ...) to C?
</a></h3><p>
  	Several public-domain programs are available:
<dl>
<dt>p2c<dd>	 A Pascal to C converter written by Dave Gillespie, posted to

<p><h3><a name="17-10">
17.10:  Is C++ a superset of C?  Can I use a C++ compiler to compile C
        code?</a></h3>
<p>
        C++ was derived from C, and is largely based on it, but there
        are some legal C constructs which are not legal C++.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Many C
        programs will nevertheless compile correctly in a C++
        environment.)
<p>
<p><h3><a name="17-11">17.11:  I need...</a></h3><p>
    Look for programs (see also <a href="c-17.html#17-12">question 17.12</a>) named:

  	If you have access to Usenet, see the regular postings in the
	comp.sources.unix and comp.sources.misc newsgroups, which
	describe, in some detail, the archiving policies and how to
	retrieve copies.&#160;<tt> </tt>The usual approach is to use anonymous ftp
	and/or uucp from a central, public-spirited site, such as uunet
	(<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/">ftp.uu.net</a>, 192.48.96.9).&#160;<tt> </tt>However, this article cannot track

        posted periodically, and available where this FAQ list is
        archived (see <a href="c-17.html#17-33">question 17.33</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>The comp.archives newsgroup
        contains numerous announcements of anonymous ftp availability of
        various items.&#160;<tt> </tt>The "archie" mailserver can tell you which
        anonymous ftp sites have which packages; send the mail message
        "help" to archie@quiche.cs.mcgill.ca for information.&#160;<tt> </tt>Finally,
        the newsgroup comp.sources.wanted is generally a more
        appropriate place to post queries for source availability, but

<a name="17-13">
17.13:	When will the next International Obfuscated C Code Contest
	(IOCCC) be held?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>How can I get a copy of the
	<a href="../ioccc/1994.html/index.html#winners">current</a> and previous winning entries?
</h3><p>
The contest schedule is tied to the dates of the USENIX
conferences at which the winners are announced.  At the time of
this writing, it is expected that the yearly contest will open
in October.  To obtain a current copy of the rules and
guidelines, send e-mail
	with the Subject: line &quot;send rules&quot; to:
<blockquote>
	   {apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges&#160;<tt> </tt>or<br>
	   judges@toad.com
</blockquote>
        (Note that these are <em>not</em> the addresses for submitting
        entries.)
<p>
Contest winners should be announced at the winter USENIX
conference in January, and are posted to the net sometime
thereafter.  Winning entries from previous years (to 1984) are
	archived at uunet (see <a href="c-17.html#17-12">question 17.12</a>) under the directory
	<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/ioccc">~/pub/ioccc</a>.
<p>
	As a last resort, previous winners may be obtained by sending
	e-mail to the above address, using the Subject: &quot;send YEAR
	winners&quot;, where YEAR is a single four-digit year, a year range,
	or &quot;all&quot;.

17.14:	Why don't C comments nest?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>How am I supposed to comment out 
code containing comments?&#160;<tt> </tt>Are comments legal inside quoted
        strings?
</h3><p>
  	Nested comments would cause more harm than good, mostly because
	of the possibility of accidentally leaving comments unclosed by
	including the characters &quot;<code>/*</code>&quot; within them.&#160;<tt> </tt>For this reason, it
	is usually better to &quot;comment out&quot; large sections of code, which
	might contain comments, with<code> #ifdef </code>or<code> #if 0 </code>(but see <a href="c-5.html#5-11">question
	5.11</a>).
<p>
	The character sequences <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> are not special within
	double-quoted strings, and do not therefore introduce comments,
	because a program (particularly one which is generating C code
	as output) might want to print them.

<h3><a name="17-15">
17.15:  How can I get the ASCII value corresponding to a character, or
        vice versa?</a></h3><p>
        In C, characters are represented by small integers corresponding
        to their values (in the machine's character set) so you don't
        need a conversion routine: if you have the character, you have
        its value.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="17-16">
17.16:	How can I implement sets and/or arrays of bits?
</a></h3><p>
  	Use arrays of char or int, with a few macros to access the right
	bit at the right index (try using 8 for <code>CHAR_BIT</code> if you don't
	have <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>):
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;limits.h&gt;		/* for CHAR_BIT */

	#define BITMASK(bit) (1 &lt;&lt; ((bit) % CHAR_BIT))
	#define BITSLOT(bit) ((bit) / CHAR_BIT)
	#define BITSET(ary, bit) ((ary)[BITSLOT(bit)] |= BITMASK(bit))
	#define BITTEST(ary, bit) ((ary)[BITSLOT(bit)] &amp; BITMASK(bit))
</pre>
<p>

<h3>
<a name="17-17">
17.17:	What is the most efficient way to count the number of bits which
	are set in a value?
</a></h3><p>
  	This and many other similar bit-twiddling problems can often be
	sped up and streamlined using lookup tables (but see the <a href="c-17.html#17-18">next
	question</a>).
<p>

<h3>
<a name="17-18">
17.18:	How can I make this code more efficient?
</a></h3><p>
  	Efficiency, though a favorite comp.lang.c topic, is not
	important nearly as often as people tend to think it is.&#160;<tt> </tt>Most
	of the code in most programs is not time-critical.&#160;<tt> </tt>When code is
	not time-critical, it is far more important that it be written
	clearly and portably than that it be written maximally
	efficiently.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Remember that computers are very, very fast, and
	that even &quot;inefficient&quot; code can run without apparent delay.)
<p>
	It is notoriously difficult to predict what the &quot;hot spots&quot; in a
	program will be.&#160;<tt> </tt>When efficiency is a concern, it is important
	to use profiling software to determine which parts of the
	program deserve attention.&#160;<tt> </tt>Often, actual computation time is
	swamped by peripheral tasks such as I/O and memory allocation,
	which can be sped up by using buffering and caching techniques.
<p>
	For the small fraction of code that is time-critical, it is
	vital to pick a good algorithm; it is less important to
	&quot;microoptimize&quot; the coding details.&#160;<tt> </tt>Many of the &quot;efficient
	coding tricks&quot; which are frequently suggested (e.g. substituting
	shift operators for multiplication by powers of two) are
	performed automatically by even simpleminded compilers.
	Heavyhanded &quot;optimization&quot; attempts can make code so bulky that
	performance is degraded.
<p>
	For more discussion of efficiency tradeoffs, as well as good
	advice on how to increase efficiency when it is important, see
	chapter 7 of Kernighan and Plauger's <a href="index.html#EoPS">The Elements of Programming
	Style</a>, and Jon Bentley's <a href="index.html#JLB">Writing Efficient Programs</a>.

<a name="17-19">
17.19:	Are pointers really faster than arrays?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>How much do function
	calls slow things down?&#160;<tt> </tt>Is<code> ++i </code>faster than<code> i = i + 1 </code>?
</h3><p>
  	Precise answers to these and many similar questions depend of
	course on the processor and compiler in use.&#160;<tt> </tt>If you simply must
	know, you'll have to time test programs carefully.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Often the
	differences are so slight that hundreds of thousands of
	iterations are required even to see them.&#160;<tt> </tt>Check the compiler's
	assembly language output, if available, to see if two purported
	alternatives aren't compiled identically.)
<p>
	It is &quot;usually&quot; faster to march through large arrays with
	pointers rather than array subscripts, but for some processors
	the reverse is true.
<p>
	Function calls, though obviously incrementally slower than in-line
	code, contribute so much to modularity and code clarity
	that there is rarely good reason to avoid them.
<p>
	Before rearranging expressions such as <code>i</code> <code>=</code> <code>i</code> <code>+</code> <code>1</code>, remember that
	you are dealing with a C compiler, not a keystroke-programmable
	calculator.&#160;<tt> </tt>Any decent compiler will generate identical code
	for<code> ++i</code>,<code> i</code> <code>+=</code> <code>1</code>,<code> </code>and<code> i</code> <code>=</code> <code>i</code> <code>+</code> <code>1</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>The reasons for using<code> ++i </code>or<code> i</code> <code>+=</code> <code>1 </code>over<code> i</code> <code>=</code> <code>i</code> <code>+</code> <code>1 </code>have to do with style, not efficiency.&#160;<tt> </tt>

  	It is unfortunately very easy to corrupt<code> malloc</code>'s internal data

17.26:  I need code to parse and evaluate expressions.</a></h3>
<p>
        Two available packages are "defunc," posted to comp.source.misc
        in December, 1993 (V41 i32,33), to alt.sources in January, 1994,
        and available from

17.27:  I need a sort of an &quot;approximate&quot;</a><code> strcmp </code>routine, for comparing
        two strings for close, but not necessarily exact, equality.</h3>
<p>
        The traditional routine for doing this sort of thing involves
        the &quot;soundex&quot; algorithm, which maps similar-sounding words to
        the same numeric codes.&#160;<tt> </tt>Soundex is described in the Searching
        and Sorting volume of Donald Knuth's classic <em>The Art of
        Computer Programming</em>.

and <a href="c-12.html#12-7">12.7</a>), or Zeller's
        congruence, or see the sci.math FAQ list, or try this code
	posted by Tomohiko Sakamoto:
<pre>
    dayofweek(y, m, d)      /* 0 = Sunday */
    int y, m, d;            /* 1 <= m <= 12,  y > 1752 or so */

17.30:	How do you pronounce &quot;char&quot;?
</a></h3><p>
  	You can pronounce the C keyword &quot;char&quot; in at least three ways:
	like the English words &quot;char,&quot; &quot;care,&quot; or &quot;car;&quot; the choice is
	arbitrary.

17.33:	Where can I get extra copies of this list?</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>What about back

</h3><p>
  	For now, just pull it off the net; it is normally posted to
	comp.lang.c on the first of each month, with an Expires: line
	which should keep it around all month.&#160;<tt> </tt>An abridged version is
        also available (and posted), as is a list of changes
        accompanying each significantly updated version.&#160;<tt> </tt>These lists
	can also be found in
	the newsgroups comp.answers and news.answers .&#160;<tt> </tt>Several sites
	archive news.answers postings and other FAQ lists, including
	this one; two sites are <a href="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet">rtfm.mit.edu</a> (directory pub/usenet), and
	<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet">ftp.uu.net</a> (directory usenet).&#160;<tt> </tt>The archie server should help
	you find others; query it for "prog C-faq".&#160;<tt> </tt>See the meta-FAQ list in news.answers for more
	information; see also question <a href="c-17.html#17-12">17.12</a>.
<p>
	This list is an evolving document of questions which have been
	Frequent since before the Great Renaming, not just a collection
	of this month's interesting questions.&#160;<tt> </tt>Older copies are
	obsolete and don't contain much, except the occasional typo,
	that the current list doesn't.
