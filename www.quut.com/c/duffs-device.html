I normally do not read comp.lang.c, but Jim McKie told me
that ``<a href="duffs-device.html#duffs-device">Duff's device</a>'' had come up in comp.lang.c again.&#160;<tt> </tt>I
have lost the version that was sent to netnews in May 1984,
but I have reproduced below the note in which I originally
proposed the device.&#160;<tt> </tt>(If anybody has a copy of the netnews
version, I would gratefully receive a copy at research!td or
td@research.att.com.)
<p>
To clear up a few points:<br>
<ol>
<li>The point of the device is to express general
	loop unrolling directly in C.&#160;<tt> </tt>People who have
	posted saying `just use memcpy' have missed the
	point, as have those who have criticized it using
	various machine-dependent memcpy implementations
	as support.&#160;<tt> </tt>In fact, the example in the message is
	not implementable as memcpy, nor is any computer
	likely to have an memcpy-like idiom that implements
	it.<p>
<li>
Somebody claimed that while the device was named
	for me, I probably didn't invent it.&#160;<tt> </tt>I almost
	certainly did invent it.&#160;<tt> </tt>I had definitely not
	seen or heard of it when I came upon it, and nobody
	has ever even claimed prior knowledge, let alone
	provided dates and times.&#160;<tt> </tt>Note the headers on the
	message below:&#160;<tt> </tt>apparently I invented the device
	on November 9, 1983, and was proud (or disgusted)
	enough to send mail to
	<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/index.html">dmr</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>Please note that I
	do not claim to have invented loop unrolling, merely
	this particular expression of it in C.<p>
<li>
The device is legal dpANS C.&#160;<tt> </tt>I cannot quote chapter
	and verse, but <a href="lr/index.html" name="lr">Larry
	Rosler</a>, who was chairman of the
	language subcommittee (I think), has assured me that X3J11
	considered it carefully and decided that it was legal.
	Somewhere I have a note from <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/index.html">dmr</a>
	certifying that all
	the compilers that he believes in accept it.&#160;<tt> </tt>Of course,
	the device is also legal C++, since Bjarne uses it in
	his book.
<p>
<li>
Somebody invoked (or more properly, banished) the
	`false god of efficiency.'&#160;<tt> </tt>Careful reading of my
	original note will put this slur to rest.&#160;<tt> </tt>The
	alternative to genuflecting before the god of
	code-bumming is finding a better algorithm.&#160;<tt> </tt>It
	should be clear that none such was available.&#160;<tt> </tt>If
	your code is too slow, you must make it faster.&#160;<tt> </tt>If no
	better algorithm is available, you must trim cycles.<p>
<li>
The same person claimed that the device wouldn't exhibit
	the desired speed-up.&#160;<tt> </tt>The argument was flawed in two
	regards:&#160;<tt> </tt>first, it didn't address the performance of
	the device, but rather the performance of one of its
	few uses (implementing memcpy) for which many machines
	have a high-performance idiom.&#160;<tt> </tt>Second, the poster
	made his claims in the absence of timing data, which
	renders his assertion suspect.&#160;<tt> </tt>A second poster tried
	the test, but botched the implementation, proving
	only that with diligence it is possible to make anything
	run slowly.<p>
<li>
Even <a href="henry/index.html" name="henry">Henry Spencer</a>, who hit every
	other nail square on the end with the flat round thing stuck to it,
	made a mistake (albeit a trivial one).&#160;<tt> </tt>Here is Henry replying
	to bill@proxftl.UUCP (T. William Wells):<br>
<pre>
   &gt;&gt;... Dollars to doughnuts this
   &gt;&gt;was written on a RISC machine.

   &gt;Nope.&#160;<tt> </tt>Bell Labs Research uses VAXen and 68Ks, mostly.
</pre>
<p>
	I was at Lucasfilm when I invented the device.<p>
<li>
Transformations like this can only be justified by measuring the
	resulting code.&#160;<tt> </tt>Be careful when you use this thing that you don't
	unwind the loop so much that you overflow your machine's instruction
	cache.&#160;<tt> </tt>Don't try to be smarter than an over-clever C compiler that
	recognizes loops that implement block move or block clear and compiles
	them into machine idioms.
</ol>

Here then, is the original document describing Duff's device:

Consider the following routine, abstracted from code which copies an
array of shorts into the Programmed IO data register of an Evans &amp;
Sutherland Picture System II:
<p>
<pre>
	send(to, from, count)
	register short *to, *from;
	register count;
	{
		do
			*to = *from++;
		while(--count&gt;0);
	}
</pre>
<p>
(Obviously, this fails if the count is zero.)<br>
The VAX C compiler compiles the loop into 2 instructions (a movw and
a sobleq,<br>I think.)&#160;<tt> </tt>As it turns out, this loop was the bottleneck in
a real-time animation playback program which ran too slowly by about 50%.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The standard way to get more speed out of something like this is to unwind
the loop a few times, decreasing the number of sobleqs.&#160;<tt> </tt>When you do that,
you wind up with a leftover partial loop.&#160;<tt> </tt>I usually handle this in C with
a switch that indexes a list of copies of the original loop body.&#160;<tt> </tt>Of
course, if I were writing assembly language code, I'd just jump into the
middle of the unwound loop to deal with the leftovers.&#160;<tt> </tt>Thinking about this
<a name="duffs-device">
yesterday, the following implementation occurred to me:</a>
<p>
<pre>
	send(to, from, count)
	register short *to, *from;
	register count;
	{
		register n=(count+7)/8;
		switch(count%8){
		case 0:	do{	*to = *from++;
		case 7:		*to = *from++;
		case 6:		*to = *from++;
		case 5:		*to = *from++;
		case 4:		*to = *from++;
		case 3:		*to = *from++;
		case 2:		*to = *from++;
		case 1:		*to = *from++;
			}while(--n&gt;0);
		}
	}
</pre>
Disgusting, no?&#160;<tt> </tt>But it compiles and runs just fine.&#160;<tt> </tt>I feel a combination
of pride and revulsion at this discovery.&#160;<tt> </tt>If no one's thought of it before,
I think I'll name it after myself.
<p>
It amazes me that after 10 years of writing C there are still little corners
that I haven't explored fully.&#160;<tt> </tt>(Actually, I have another revolting way to
use switches to implement interrupt driven state machines but it's too
horrid to go into.)
<p>
Many people (even <a href="bwk/index.html" name="bwk">bwk</a>?) have said that the worst feature of C is that
switches don't break automatically before each case label.&#160;<tt> </tt>This code forms
some sort of argument in that debate, but I'm not sure whether it's for or
against.
