<h1><a name="2">2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Environment</h1>
<p>
Because C has seen widespread use as a <a name="cross-compilation-2">cross-compiled</a>
language,
a clear distinction must be made between translation and execution environments.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The <a name="preprocessing-2">preprocessor</a>,
for instance, is permitted to evaluate the expression in a
<a name="-35if-2"><code>#if</code></a> statement
using the long integer arithmetic native to the translation environment:
these integers must comprise at least 32 bits,
but need not match the number of bits in the execution environment.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Other translate-time arithmetic, however, such as type casting and floating
arithmetic, must more closely model the execution environment regardless
of translation environment.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-1">2.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Conceptual models</h2>
<p>
The <a name="as-if"><i>as if</i></a> principle is invoked repeatedly in this Rationale.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee has found that
describing various aspects of the C language, library, and environment
in terms of concrete models
best serves discussion and presentation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Every attempt has been made to craft the models
so that implementors are constrained only insofar as
they must bring about the same result,
<i>as if</i> they had implemented the presentation model;
often enough the clearest model would make for the worst implementation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-1-1">2.1.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Translation environment</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-1-1-1">2.1.1.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Program structure</h2>
<p>
The terms
<a name="source-file"><i>source file</i></a>,
<a name="external-linkage"><i>external linkage</i></a>,
<a name="linked"><i>linked</i></a>,
<a name="libraries"><i>libraries</i></a>,
and
<a name="executable-program"><i>executable program</i></a>
all imply a conventional compiler-linker combination.&#160;<tt> </tt>
All of these concepts have shaped the semantics of C, however,
and are inescapable even in an interpreted environment.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus, while implementations are not required to support separate
compilation and linking with libraries, in some ways they must behave
<a href="b.html#as-if" name="as-if-2-1-1-1"><i>as if</i></a> they do.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-1-1-2">2.1.1.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt><a name="phases-of-translation-2-1-1-2">Translation phases</a></h2>

<p>
Perhaps the greatest undesirable diversity
among existing C implementations can be found in <a name="preprocessing-2-1-1-2">preprocessing</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Admittedly a distinct and primitive language superimposed upon C,
the preprocessing commands accreted over time,
with little central direction,
and with even less precision in their documentation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This evolution has resulted in a variety of local features,
each with its ardent adherents:
the Base Document offers little clear basis for
choosing one over the other.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The consensus of the Committee is that preprocessing should be simple and
<i>overt</i>,
that it should sacrifice power for clarity.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For instance, the macro invocation
<code>f(a,</code> <code>b)</code>
should assuredly have two actual arguments, even if
<code>b</code> expands to <code>c,</code> <code>d</code>;
and the formal definition of <code>f</code> must call for exactly two arguments.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Above all, the preprocessing sub-language
should be specified precisely enough to minimize
or eliminate dialect formation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
To clarify the nature of preprocessing,
the translation from source text to tokens is spelled out as a number
of separate phases.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The separate phases need not actually be present in the translator,
but the net effect must be <a href="b.html#as-if" name="as-if-2-1-1-2"><i>as if</i></a> they were.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The phases need not be performed in a separate preprocessor,
although the definition certainly permits this common practice.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Since the preprocessor need not know anything about the specific properties of
the target, a machine-independent implementation is permissible.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Committee deemed that it was outside the scope of its mandate to
require the output of the preprocessing
phases be available as a separate translator output file.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The <i>phases of translation</i> are spelled out
to resolve the numerous questions raised about the precedence of
different parses.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Can a <code>#define</code> begin a comment? (No.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
Is backslash/new-line permitted within a trigraph? (No.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
Must a comment be contained within one <code>#include</code> file? (Yes.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
And so on.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Rationale section on preprocessing (<a href="c8.html#3-8">&#167;3.8</a>)&#160;<tt> </tt>
discusses the reasons for many of the particular decisions
which shaped the specification of the phases of translation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

A backslash immediately before a new-line has long been used to continue
string literals,
as well as preprocessing command lines.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In the interest of easing <a name="machine-generation-of-C-2-1-1-2">machine generation of C</a>,
and of transporting code to machines with restrictive physical line lengths,
the Committee generalized this mechanism to permit
<i>any</i> token to be continued by interposing a
backslash/new-line sequence.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-1-1-3">2.1.1.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt><a name="diagnostics-2-1-1-3">Diagnostics</a></h2>
<p>
By mandating some form of diagnostic message for any program containing
a syntax error or constraint violation,
the Standard performs two important services.&#160;<tt> </tt>
First, it gives teeth to the concept of <a name="erroneous-program"><i>erroneous program</i></a>,
since a conforming implementation must distinguish such a program
from a valid one.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Second, it severely constrains the nature of extensions permissible
to a conforming implementation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Standard says nothing about the nature of the diagnostic message,
which could simply be ``<tt>syntax error</tt>'',
with no hint of where the error occurs.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(An implementation must, of course, describe what translator output 
constitutes a diagnostic message, so that the user can recognize it as
such.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee ultimately decided that any diagnostic activity
beyond this level is an issue of <a name="quality-of-implementation"><i>quality of implementation</i></a>,
and that market forces would encourage more useful diagnostics.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Nevertheless, the Committee felt that at least some significant class of
errors must be diagnosed,
and the class specified should be recognizable by all translators.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Standard does not forbid extensions,
but such extensions must not invalidate strictly conforming programs.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The translator must diagnose the use of such extensions,
or allow them to be disabled as discussed in (Rationale) <a href="a.html#1-7">&#167;1.7</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Otherwise, extensions to a conforming C implementation lie in such realms
as defining semantics
for syntax to which no semantics is ascribed by the Standard,
or giving meaning to <a name="undefined-behavior-2-1-1-3"><i>undefined behavior</i></a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-1-2">2.1.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Execution environments</h2>
<p>
The definition of <a name="program-startup"><i>program startup</i></a> in the Standard is designed to
permit initialization of static storage by executable code,
as well as by data translated into the program image.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-1-2-1">2.1.2.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Freestanding environment</h2>
<p>
As little as possible is said about freestanding environments,
since little is served by constraining them.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-1-2-2">2.1.2.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt><a name="hosted-environment-2-1-2-2">Hosted environment</a></h2>
<p>
The properties required of a hosted environment are spelled out
in a fair amount of detail
in order to give programmers a reasonable chance of writing
programs which are portable among such environments.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The behavior of the arguments to <a name="main-2-1-2-2"><code>main</code></a>,
and of the interaction of <a name="exit-2-1-2-2"><code>exit</code></a>,
<code>main</code> and <a name="atexit-2-1-2-2"><code>atexit</code></a> (see <a href="d10.html#4-10-4-2">&#167;4.10.4.2</a>)&#160;<tt> </tt>
has been codified to curb some unwanted
variety in the representation of <code>argv</code> strings,
and in the meaning of values returned by <code>main</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The specification of <a name="argc-2-1-2-2"><code>argc</code></a> and <code>argv</code>
as arguments to <code>main</code> recognizes extensive prior practice.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<code>argv[argc]</code> is required to be a null pointer to provide
a redundant check for the end of the list,
also on the basis of common practice.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<code>main</code> is the only function that may portably be declared
either with zero or two arguments.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(The number of arguments must ordinarily match exactly
between invocation and definition.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
This special case simply recognizes the widespread practice of leaving off the
arguments to <code>main</code>
when the program does not access the program argument strings.&#160;<tt> </tt>
While many implementations support more than two arguments to <code>main,</code>
such practice is neither blessed nor forbidden by the Standard;
a program that defines <code>main</code> with three arguments is not
<a name="strictly-conforming"><i>strictly conforming</i></a>. (See Standard Appendix F.5.1.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<p>
Command line I/O redirection is not mandated by the Standard;
this was deemed to be a feature of the underlying operating
system rather than the C language.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-1-2-3">2.1.2.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Program execution</h2>
<p>
Because C expressions can contain side effects,
issues of
<a name="sequencing"><i>sequencing</i></a>
are important in expression evaluation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(See <a href="c3.html#3-3">&#167;3.3</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
Most operators impose no sequencing requirements,
but a few operators impose
<a name="sequence-points"><i>sequence points</i></a>
upon the evaluation:
comma, logical-AND, logical-OR, and conditional.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For example, in the expression
<code>(i</code> <code>=</code> <code>1, a[i]</code> <code>=</code> <code>0)</code>
the side effect (alteration to storage) specified by
<code>i</code> <code>=</code> <code>1</code>
must be completed before the expression
<code>a[i]</code> <code>=</code> <code>0</code>
is evaluated.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Other sequence points are imposed by statement execution and
completion of evaluation of a
<a name="full-expression"><i>full expression</i></a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(See <a href="c6.html#3-6">&#167;3.6</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus in <code>fn(++a)</code>,
the incrementation of <code>a</code> must be completed before <code>fn</code> is called.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In <code>i</code> <code>=</code> <code>1;</code> <code>a[i]</code> <code>=</code> <code>0;</code>
the side-effect of <code>i</code> <code>=</code> <code>1</code>
must be complete before <code>a[i]</code> <code>=</code> <code>0</code> is evaluated.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The notion of
<i>agreement</i>
has to do with the relationship between the
<a name="abstract-machine"><i>abstract machine</i></a>
defining the semantics
and an actual implementation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
An <a name="agreement-point"><i>agreement point</i></a> for some object or class of objects
is a sequence point at which the value of the object(s)&#160;<tt> </tt>
in the real implementation
must agree with the value prescribed by the abstract semantics.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
For example, compilers that hold variables in registers
can sometimes drastically reduce execution times.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In a loop like
<pre>        sum = 0;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
            sum += a[i];
</pre>both <code>sum</code> and <code>i</code>
might be profitably kept in registers during the execution of the loop.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus, the actual memory objects designated by <code>sum</code> and <code>i</code>
would not change state during the loop.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Such behavior is, of course, too loose for hardware-oriented applications
such as device drivers and memory-mapped I/O.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The following loop looks almost identical to the previous example,
but the specification of <code>volatile</code> ensures that each assignment to
<code>*ttyport</code> takes place in the same sequence, and with the same values,
as the (hypothetical) abstract machine would have done.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<pre>        volatile short *ttyport;
        /* ... */
        for (i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
            *ttyport = a[i];
</pre><p>
Another common optimization is to pre-compute common subexpressions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In this loop:
<pre>        volatile short *ttyport;
        short mask1, mask2;
        /* ... */
        for (i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
            *ttyport = a[i] &amp; mask1 &amp; mask2;
</pre>evaluation of the subexpression <code>mask1</code> <code>&amp;</code> <code>mask2</code>
could be performed prior to the loop in the real implementation,
assuming that neither <code>mask1</code> nor <code>mask2</code> appear as
an operand of the address-of (<code>&amp;</code>) operator anywhere in the function.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In the abstract machine, of course,
this subexpression is re-evaluated at each loop iteration,
but the real implementation is not required to mimic this repetitiveness,
because the variables <code>mask1</code> and <code>mask2</code> are not <code>volatile</code>
and the same results are obtained either way.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The previous example shows that a subexpression can be pre-computed
in the real implementation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
A question sometimes asked regarding optimization is,
``Is the rearrangement still conforming if the pre-computed
expression might raise a <a name="signal-2-1-2-3">signal</a> (such as division by zero)?''&#160;<tt> </tt>
Fortunately for optimizers, the answer is ``Yes,''&#160;<tt> </tt>
because any evaluation that raises a computational signal
has fallen into an <a name="undefined-behavior"><i>undefined behavior</i></a> (<a href="c3.html#3-3">&#167;3.3</a>),
for which any action is allowable.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Behavior is described in terms of an <i>abstract machine</i> to underscore,
once again, that the Standard mandates results
<a href="b.html#as-if" name="as-if-2-1-2-3"><i>as if</i></a> certain mechanisms are used,
without requiring those actual mechanisms in the implementation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Standard specifies agreement points at which
the value of an object or class of objects in an implementation must agree
with the value ascribed by the abstract semantics.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Appendix B to the Standard
lists the sequence points
specified in the body of the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The class of <a name="interactive-devices"><i>interactive devices</i></a> is intended to include
at least asynchronous terminals, or paired display screens and keyboards.&#160;<tt> </tt>
An implementation may extend the definition to include other input and
output devices, or even network inter-program connections,
provided they obey the Standard's characterization of interactivity.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-2">2.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Environmental considerations</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-2-1">2.2.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Character sets</h2>
<p>
The Committee ultimately came to remarkable
unanimity on the subject of character set requirements.&#160;<tt> </tt>
There was strong sentiment that C should not be tied to <a name="ASCII-2-2-1">ASCII</a>,
despite its heritage and despite the precedent of
<a name="Ada-2-2-1">Ada</a> being defined in terms of ASCII.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Rather, an implementation is required to provide a unique
character code for each of the printable graphics used by C,
and for each of the control codes representable by an escape sequence.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(No particular graphic representation for any character is 
prescribed --- thus the common Japanese practice of using the glyph 
&#165; for the C character \ is perfectly legitimate.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
Translation and execution environments may have different character sets,
but each must meet this requirement in its own way.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The goal is to ensure that a conforming implementation can translate a
C translator written in C.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
For this reason, and economy of description,
source code is described <a href="b.html#as-if" name="as-if-2-2-1"><i>as if</i></a>
it undergoes the same translation as text that is input by the standard library
I/O routines:
each line is terminated by some new-line character,
regardless of its external representation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-2-1-1">2.2.1.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Trigraph sequences</h2>
<a name="Trigraph-sequences"><i>Trigraph sequences</i></a>
have been introduced as alternate spellings of some characters
to allow the implementation of C
in character sets which do not provide a sufficient number of
non-alphabetic graphics.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Implementations are required to support these alternate spellings,
even if the character set in use is <a name="ASCII-2-2-1-1">ASCII</a>,
in order to allow transportation of code from systems
which must use the trigraphs.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Committee faced a serious problem in trying to define a character set
for C.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Not all of the character sets in general use have the right number of
characters,
nor do they support the graphical symbols that C users expect to see.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For instance, many character sets for languages other than English
resemble ASCII except that codes used for
graphic characters in ASCII are instead used for extra alphabetic characters
or diacritical marks.&#160;<tt> </tt>
C relies upon a richer set of graphic characters
than most other programming languages,
so the representation of programs in character sets other than ASCII
is a greater problem than for most other programming languages.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The International Standards Organization (<a name="ISO-2-2-1-1">ISO</a>)&#160;<tt> </tt>
uses three technical terms to describe character sets:
<a name="repertoire"><i>repertoire</i></a>, <a name="collating-sequence"><i>collating sequence</i></a>, and <a name="codeset"><i>codeset</i></a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The <i>repertoire</i> is the set of distinct printable characters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The term abstracts the notion of printable character from any particular
representation;
the glyphs R, {calligraphy R}, <i>R</i>, <b>R</b>, {slanted R}, {sans-serif R}, and {Re}
all represent the same element of the repertoire, upper-case-R,
which is distinct from lower-case-r.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Having decided on the repertoire to be used
(C needs a repertoire of 96 characters),
one can then pick a
<i>collating sequence</i>
which corresponds to the internal representation in a computer.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The repertoire and collating sequence together form the <i>codeset</i>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
What is needed for C is to determine the necessary repertoire,
ignore the collating sequence altogether
(it is of no importance to the language),
and then find ways of expressing the repertoire
in a way that should give no problems with currently popular codesets.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
C derived its repertoire from the ASCII codeset.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Unfortunately the ASCII repertoire is not a subset of all other commonly
used character sets,
and widespread practice in Europe is not to implement all of ASCII either,
but use some parts of its collating sequence for special national characters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The solution is an internationally agreed-upon repertoire,
in terms of which an international representation of C can be defined.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The ISO has defined such a standard:
<a name="ISO-646-2-2-1-1">ISO 646</a> describes an <i>invariant subset</i> of ASCII.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The characters in the ASCII repertoire used by C and absent
from the ISO 646 repertoire are:
<pre>        # [ ] { } \ | ~ ^
</pre>Given this repertoire,
the Committee faced the problem of defining representations for
the absent characters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The obvious idea of defining two-character escape sequences fails
because C uses all the characters which
<i>are</i> in the ISO 646 repertoire:
no single escape character is available.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The best that can be done is to use a
<i>trigraph</i> --- an escape digraph followed by a distinguishing character.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<code>??</code>
was selected as the escape digraph because it is not used anywhere else in C
(except as noted below);
it suggests that something unusual is going on.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The third character was chosen with an eye to graphical similarity
to the character being represented.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The sequence <code>??</code>
cannot currently occur anywhere in a legal C program except in strings,
character constants, comments, or header names.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The character escape sequence <code>'\?'</code>
(see <a href="c1.html#3-1-3-4">&#167;3.1.3.4</a>)&#160;<tt> </tt>
was introduced to allow two adjacent question-marks in such contexts
to be represented as <code>?\?</code>,
a form distinct from the escape digraph.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Committee makes no claims that a program written using trigraphs
looks attractive.&#160;<tt> </tt>
As a matter of style, it may be wise to surround trigraphs with
white space, so that they stand out better in program text.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Some users may wish to define preprocessing macros for some or all
of the trigraph sequences.
<p>
<ul><ul><ul><ul><b>QUIET CHANGE</b><p></ul></ul></ul>Programs with character sequences such as <code>??!</code> in string
constants, character constants, or header names will now produce
different results.&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul><h2><a name="2-2-1-2">2.2.1.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt><a name="multibyte-characters-2-2-1-2">Multibyte characters</a></h2>


<p>
The ``byte = character'' orientation of C works well for text in Western
alphabets, where the size of the character set is under 256.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The fit is rather uncomfortable for languages such as Japanese and
Chinese, where the repertoire of ideograms numbers in the thousands
or tens of thousands.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Internally, such character sets can be represented as numeric codes,
and it is merely necessary to choose the appropriate integral type
to hold any such character.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Externally, whether in the files manipulated by a program, or in the
text of the source files themselves,
a conversion between these large codes and the various byte media is
necessary.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The support in C of large character sets is based on these principles:
<ul><li>Multibyte encodings of large character sets are necessary in
    I/O operations, in source text comments, and in source text
    string and character literals.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>No existing multibyte encoding is mandated in preference to any
    other;  no widespread existing encoding should be precluded.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>The null character (<code>'\0'</code>) may not be used as part
    of a multibyte encoding, except for the one-byte null character
    itself.  This allows existing functions which manipulate strings
    transparently to work with multibyte sequences.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>Shift encodings (which interpret byte sequences in part on the
    basis of some state information) must start out in a known (default)&#160;<tt> </tt>
    shift state under certain circumstances, such as the start of
    string literals.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>The minimum number of absolutely necessary library functions
    is introduced.  (See <a href="d10.html#4-10-7">&#167;4.10.7</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul><h2><a name="2-2-2">2.2.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Character display semantics</h2>
<p>
The Standard defines a number of internal character codes
for specifying ``format effecting actions on display devices,''&#160;<tt> </tt>
and provides printable escape sequences for each of them.&#160;<tt> </tt>
These character codes are clearly modelled after <a name="ASCII-2-2-2">ASCII</a> control codes,
and the mnemonic letters used to specify their escape sequences
reflect this heritage.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Nevertheless, they are <i>internal</i> codes
for specifying the format of a display in an environment-independent manner;
they must be written to a <i>text file</i>
to effect formatting on a display device.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Standard states quite clearly that
the external representation of a text file (or data stream)&#160;<tt> </tt>
may well differ from the internal form,
both in character codes and number of characters needed to represent
a single internal code.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The distinction between internal and external codes most needs emphasis
with respect to <a name="new-line"><i>new-line</i></a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<a name="ANSI-X3L2-2-2-2">ANSI X3L2</a> (Codes and Character Sets)&#160;<tt> </tt>
uses the term to refer to an external code used for information interchange
whose display semantics specify a move to the next line.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Both ANSI X3L2 and ISO 646 deprecate the combination of the motion to the
next line with a motion to the initial position on the line.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The C Standard, on the other hand, uses <i>new-line</i>
to designate the end-of-line internal code
represented by the escape sequence <code>'\n'</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
While this ambiguity is perhaps unfortunate,
use of the term in the latter sense is nearly universal within the C community.&#160;<tt> </tt>
But the knowledge that this internal code has numerous external
representations, depending upon operating system and medium,
is equally widespread.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The alert sequence (<code>'\a'</code>) has been added by popular demand,
to replace, for instance, the ASCII BEL code explicitly coded as
<code>'\007'</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Proposals to add <code>'\e'</code> for ASCII ESC (<code>'\033'</code>)&#160;<tt> </tt>
were not adopted because other popular character
sets such as <a name="EBCDIC-2-2-2">EBCDIC</a> have no obvious equivalent.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(See <a href="c1.html#3-1-3-4">&#167;3.1.3.4</a>.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The vertical tab sequence (<code>'\v'</code>)&#160;<tt> </tt>
was added since many existing
implementations support it,
and since it is convenient to have a designation within the language
for all the defined white space characters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The semantics of the motion control escape sequences carefully avoid
the Western language assumptions that printing advances left-to-right
and top-to-bottom.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
To avoid the issue of whether an implementation conforms if it cannot
properly effect vertical tabs (for instance),
the Standard emphasizes that the semantics merely describe <i>intent</i>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-2-3">2.2.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Signals and interrupts</h2>

<p>
<a name="Signals"><i>Signals</i></a>
are difficult to specify in a system-independent way.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee concluded
that about the only thing a strictly conforming
program can do in a signal handler is to
assign a value to a <code>volatile static</code> variable
which can be written uninterruptedly
and promptly return.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(The header <a name="-60signal-46h-62-2-2-3"><code>&lt;signal.h&gt;</code></a> specifies a type <a name="sig-95atomic-95t-2-2-3"><code>sig_atomic_t</code></a>
which can be so written.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
It is further guaranteed that a signal handler will not corrupt
the automatic storage of
an instantiation of any executing function,
even if that function is called within the signal handler.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
No such guarantees can be extended to library functions,
with the explicit exceptions of
<a name="longjmp-2-2-3"><code>longjmp</code></a> (<a href="d6.html#4-6-2-1">&#167;4.6.2.1</a>)&#160;<tt> </tt>
and <a name="signal-2-2-3"><code>signal</code></a> (<a href="d7.html#4-7-1-1">&#167;4.7.1.1</a>),
since the library functions may be arbitrarily interrelated
and since some of them have profound effect on the environment.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Calls to <code>longjmp</code> are problematic,
despite the assurances of <a href="d6.html#4-6-2-1">&#167;4.6.2.1</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The signal could have occurred during the execution of some
library function which was in the process of updating external
state and/or static variables.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
A second signal for the same handler could occur before the first
is processed, and the Standard makes no guarantees as to what
happens to the second signal.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-2-4">2.2.4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Environmental limits</h2>
<p>
The Committee
agreed that the Standard must say something about certain
capacities and limitations, but just how to enforce these treaty points
was the topic of considerable debate.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-2-4-1">2.2.4.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Translation limits</h2>
<p>
The Standard requires that an implementation be able to translate
and compile some program that meets each of the stated limits.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This criterion was felt to give a useful latitude to the implementor
in meeting these limits.&#160;<tt> </tt>
While a deficient implementation could probably contrive
a program that meets this requirement, yet still succeed in being useless,
the Committee felt that such ingenuity would probably require more work
than making something useful.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The sense of the Committee is that
implementors should not construe the translation limits
as the values of hard-wired parameters, but
rather as a set of criteria by which an implementation will be judged.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Some of the limits chosen represent interesting compromises.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The goal was to allow reasonably large portable programs to be written,
without placing excessive burdens on reasonably small implementations.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The minimum maximum limit of 257 cases in a switch statement
allows coding of lexical routines which can branch on
any character (one of at least 256 values) or on the value EOF.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="2-2-4-2">2.2.4.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Numerical limits</h2>

<p>
In addition to the discussion below, see <a href="d1.html#4-1-4">&#167;4.1.4</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h3><a name="2-2-4-2-1">2.2.4.2.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Sizes of integral types <code>&lt;</code><a name="-60limits-46h-62-2-2-4-2-1"><code>limits</code></a><code>.h&gt;</code></h3>

Such a large body of C code has been developed for 8-bit byte machines
that the integer sizes in such environments must be considered normative.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The prescribed limits are minima:
an implementation on a machine with 9-bit bytes can be conforming,
as can an implementation that defines
<code>int</code> to be the same width as <code>long</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The negative limits have been chosen to accommodate
<a name="ones-complement-2-2-4-2-1">ones-complement</a> or <a name="sign-magnitude-2-2-4-2-1">sign-magnitude</a> implementations,
as well as the more usual twos-complement.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The limits for the maxima and minima of unsigned types are specified
as unsigned constants (e.g., <code>65535u</code>)&#160;<tt> </tt>
to avoid surprising widenings of expressions involving these extrema.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The macro <code>CHAR_BIT</code> makes available the number of bits in a <code>char</code> object.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee saw little utility in 
adding such macros for other data types.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The names associated with the <code>short int</code> types (<code>SHRT_MIN</code>,
etc., rather than <code>SHORT_MIN</code>, etc.) reflect prior art
rather than obsessive abbreviation on the Committee's part.

<h3><a name="2-2-4-2-2">2.2.4.2.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Characteristics of floating types <code>&lt;</code><a name="-60float-46h-62-2-2-4-2-2"><code>float</code></a><code>.h&gt;</code></h3>

<p>
The characterization of floating point follows, with minor changes,
that of the FORTRAN standardization committee (X3J3).&#160;<tt> </tt>[Footnote: 
    See X3J3 working document S8-112.]&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee chose to follow the FORTRAN model
in some part out of a concern for <a name="FORTRAN-to-C-translation-2-2-4-2-2">FORTRAN-to-C translation</a>,
and in large part out of deference to the FORTRAN committee's greater
experience with fine points of floating point usage.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Note that the floating point model adopted 
permits all common representations,
including sign-magnitude and twos-complement,
but precludes a logarithmic implementation.
<p>
Single precision (32-bit) floating point
is considered adequate to support a conforming C implementation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus the minimum maxima constraining floating types are extremely permissive.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The Committee has also endeavored to accommodate
the <a name="IEEE-754-fp-standard-2-2-4-2-2">IEEE 754 floating point standard</a>
by not adopting any constraints on floating point which
are contrary to this standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The term <code>FLT_MANT_DIG</code> stands for ``float mantissa digits.''&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Standard now uses the more precise term <a name="significand"><i>significand</i></a> rather than
<a name="mantissa"><i>mantissa</i></a>.
