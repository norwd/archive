<h1><a name="3-8">3.8</a>&#160;<tt> </tt><a name="preprocessing-3-8">Preprocessing</a> directives</h1>

<p>
For an overview of the philosophy behind the preprocessor, see <a href="b.html#2-1-1-2">&#167;2.1.1.2</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Different implementations have had different notions about whether
white space is permissible before and/or after the <code>#</code>
signalling a preprocessor line.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee decided to allow 
any white space before the <code>#</code>,
and horizontal white space (spaces or tabs)&#160;<tt> </tt>
between the <code>#</code> and the directive,
since the white space introduces no ambiguity,
causes no particular processing problems,
and allows maximum flexibility in coding style.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Note that similar considerations apply for comments,
which are reduced to white space early in the phases of
translation (<a href="b.html#2-1-1-2">&#167;2.1.1.2</a>): 
<pre>         /* here a comment */ #if BLAH
        #/* there a comment */ if BLAH
        # if /* every-
            where a comment */ BLAH
</pre>The lines all illustrate legitimate placement of comments.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-1">3.8.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Conditional inclusion</h2>
<p>
For a discussion of evaluation of expressions following <code>#if</code>, see <a href="c4.html#3-4">&#167;3.4</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The operator <a name="defined-3-8-1"><code>defined</code></a> has been added
to make possible writing
boolean combinations of defined flags with
one another and with other inclusion conditions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
If the identifier <code>defined</code> were to be defined as a macro,
<code>defined(X)</code>
would mean the macro expansion in C text proper
and the operator expression in a preprocessing directive
(or else that the operator would no longer be available).&#160;<tt> </tt>
To avoid this problem, such a definition is not permitted (<a href="c8.html#3-8-8">&#167;3.8.8</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<a name="-35elif-3-8-1"><code>#elif</code></a> has been added to minimize the stacking of
<a name="-35endif-3-8-1"><code>#endif</code></a> directives in multi-way conditionals.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Processing of skipped material is defined such that an implementation
need only examine a logical line for the <code>#</code> and then for a directive
name.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus, assuming that <code>xxx</code> is undefined, in this example:
<pre>        # ifndef xxx
        # define xxx &quot;abc&quot;
        # elif xxx &gt; 0
            /* ... */
        # endif
</pre>an implementation is not required to diagnose an error for the
<code>elif</code> statement,
even though if it <i>were</i> processed,
a syntactic error would be detected.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Various proposals were considered for permitting text other than comments
at the end of directives,
particularly <code>#endif</code> and <a name="-35else-3-8-1"><code>#else</code></a>,
presumably to label them for easier matchup with their corresponding
<code>#if</code> directives.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee rejected all such proposals
because of the difficulty of specifying exactly what would be permitted,
and how the translator would have to process it.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Various proposals were considered for permitting additional unary
expressions to be used for the purpose of testing for the system type,
testing for the presence of a file before
<code>#include</code>,
and other extensions to the preprocessing language.&#160;<tt> </tt>
These proposals were all rejected on the grounds of insufficient
prior art and/or insufficient utility.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-2">3.8.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Source file inclusion</h2>
<p>
Specification of the <a name="-35include-3-8-2"><code>#include</code></a>
directive raises distinctive grammatical problems
because the file name is conventionally parsed quite differently than an
``ordinary'' token sequence:
<p>
<ul><li>The angle brackets are not operators, but delimiters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>The double quotes do not delimit a string literal
    with all its defined escape sequences.&#160;<tt> </tt>
    (In some systems, backslash is a legitimate character in a filename.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
    The construct just looks like a string literal.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>White space or characters not in the C repertoire
    may be permissible and significant
    within either or both forms.&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul>These points in the description of phases of translation
are of particular relevance to the parse of the
<code>#include</code> directive:
<ul><li>Any character otherwise unrecognized during tokenization
 is an instance of an ``invalid token.''&#160;<tt> </tt>
 As with valid tokens, the spelling is retained
 so that later phases can, if necessary,
 map a token sequence (back) into a sequence of characters.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>Preprocessing phases must maintain the spelling of preprocessing tokens;
 the filename is based on the original spelling
 of the tokens, not on any interpretation of escape sequences.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>The filename on the <code>#include</code> (and <code>#line</code>) directive,
 if it does not begin with <code>&quot;</code> or <code>&lt;</code>,
 is macro expanded prior to execution of the directive.&#160;<tt> </tt>
 Allowing macros in the <code>include</code>
 directive facilitates the parameterization of include file names,
 an important issue in transportability.&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul>
The file search rules used for the filename in the <code>#include</code>
directive were left as implementation-defined.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Standard intends that the rules which are eventually provided by
the implementor correspond as closely as possible to the original K&amp;R rules.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The primary reason that explicit rules were not included in the Standard
is the infeasibility of describing a portable file system structure.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It was considered unacceptable to include <a name="UNIX-3-8-2">UNIX</a>-like directory rules due
to significant differences between this structure and other popular
commercial file system structures.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
Nested include files raise an issue of interpreting the file search rules.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In UNIX C an include statement found within an include file
entails a search for the named file relative to the file system
<i>directory</i> that holds the outer <code>#include</code>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Other implementations, including the earlier UNIX C described in K&amp;R,
always search relative to the same <i>current directory</i>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee decided, in principle, in favor of the K&amp;R approach,
but was unable to provide explicit search rules as explained above.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

The Standard specifies a set of include file names which must
map onto distinct host file names.  In the absence of such a requirement,
it would be impossible to write portable programs using include files.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

Section <a href="b.html#2-2-4-1">&#167;2.2.4.1</a> on translation limits contains the required number of
nesting levels for include files.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The limits chosen were intended to
reflect reasonable needs for users constrained by reasonable system
resources available to implementors.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

By defining a failure to read an include file as a syntax error,
the Standard requires that the failure be diagnosed.&#160;<tt> </tt>
More than one proposal was presented for some form of conditional include,
or a directive such as <code>#ifincludable</code>,
but none were accepted by the Committee
due to lack of prior art.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-3">3.8.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Macro replacement</h2>
<p>
The specification of macro definition and replacement in the Standard
was based on these principles:
<ul><li>Interfere with existing code as little as possible.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>Keep the preprocessing model simple and uniform.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>Allow macros to be used wherever functions can be.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>Define macro expansion such that it produces the same token sequence
	whether the macro calls appear in open text,
	in macro arguments, or in macro definitions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul>
Preprocessing is specified in such a way that it can be implemented
as a separate (text-to-text) pre-pass or as a (token-oriented) portion
of the compiler itself.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Thus, the preprocessing grammar is specified in terms of tokens.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
However, the new-line character must be a token during preprocessing,
because the preprocessing grammar is line-oriented.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The presence or absence of white space is also important in several contexts,
such as between the macro name and a following 
parenthesis in a <code>#define</code> directive.&#160;<tt> </tt>
To avoid overly constraining the implementation,
the Standard allows the preservation of each white space character
(which is easy for a text-to-text pre-pass)&#160;<tt> </tt>
or the mapping of white space into a single ``white space'' token
(which is easier for token-oriented translators).&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

The Committee desired to disallow ``pernicious redefinitions''&#160;<tt> </tt>
such as
<p>
(in header1.h)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<pre>        #define NBUFS 10
</pre>
<p>
(in header2.h)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<pre>        #define NBUFS 12
</pre>
which are clearly invitations to serious bugs in a program.&#160;<tt> </tt>
There remained, however, the question of
``<a name="benign-redefinition-3-8-3">benign redefinitions</a>,''
such as
<p>
(in header1.h)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<pre>        #define NULL_DEV 0
</pre>
<p>
(in header2.h)&#160;<tt> </tt>
<pre>        #define NULL_DEV 0
</pre>
The Committee concluded that
safe programming practice is better served by
allowing benign redefinition where the definitions are the same.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This allows independent headers to specify their understanding of the proper
value for a symbol of interest to each,
with <a name="diagnostics-3-8-3" href="b.html#diagnostics-2-1-1-3">diagnostics</a> generated only if the definitions differ.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The definitions are considered ``the same'' if
the identifier-lists, token sequences, and occurrences of white-space
(ignoring the spelling of white-space)&#160;<tt> </tt>
in the two definitions are identical.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

Existing implementations have differed on whether keywords can be redefined
by macro definitions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee has decided to allow this usage;
it sees such redefinition as useful during the transition from existing
to Standard-conforming translators.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
These definitions illustrate possible uses:
<pre>        # define char   signed char
        # define sizeof (int) sizeof
        # define const
</pre>The first case might be useful in moving extant code from a signed-char
implementation to one in which <code>char</code> is unsigned.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The second case might be useful in adapting code which assumes that
<code>sizeof</code> results in an <code>int</code> value.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The redefinition of <code>const</code> could be useful in
retrofitting more modern C code to an older implementation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
As with any other powerful language feature, keyword redefinition
is subject to abuse.  Users cannot expect any meaningful behavior 
to come about from source files starting with
<pre>        #define int double
        #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>or similar subversions of common sense.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-3-1">3.8.3.1</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Argument substitution</h2>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-3-2">3.8.3.2</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>#</code> operator</h2>
<p>
Some implementations have decided to
replace identifiers found within a string literal
if they match a macro argument name.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The replacement text is a ``<a name="stringizing-3-8-3-2">stringized</a>''
form of the actual argument token sequence.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This practice appears to be contrary to the definition, in K&amp;R,
of preprocessing in terms of token sequences.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee declined to elaborate the syntax of string literals
to the point where this practice could be condoned.&#160;<tt> </tt>
However, since the facility provided by this mechanism seems
to be widely used,
the Committee introduced a more tractable mechanism of comparable power.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The <code>#</code> operator has been introduced for stringizing.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It may only be used in a <code>#define</code> expansion.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It causes the formal parameter name following to be replaced by
a string literal formed by stringizing the actual argument token
sequence.&#160;<tt> </tt>
In conjunction with string literal concatenation (see <a href="c1.html#3-1-4">&#167;3.1.4</a>),
use of this operator
permits the construction of strings as effectively as by identifier
replacement within a string.&#160;<tt> </tt>
An example in the Standard illustrates this feature.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
One problem with defining the effect of stringizing is the treatment
of white space occurring in macro definitions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Where this could be discarded in the past, now upwards of
one logical line worth (over 500 characters) may have to be retained.&#160;<tt> </tt>
As a compromise
between token-based and character-based preprocessing disciplines,
the Committee decided to permit white space to be
retained as one bit of information:  none or one.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Arbitrary white space is replaced in the string by one space character.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The remaining problem with stringizing was to associate a ``spelling''&#160;<tt> </tt>
with each token.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(The problem arises in token-based preprocessors, which might,
for instance, convert a numeric literal to a canonical or internal
representation, losing information about base, leading 0's, etc.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
In the interest of simplicity, the Committee decided that each token
should expand to just those characters used to specify it in the
original source text.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<ul><ul><ul><ul><b>QUIET CHANGE</b><p></ul></ul></ul>A macro that relies on formal parameter substitution
within a string literal will produce different results.&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul><h2><a name="3-8-3-3">3.8.3.3</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>The <code>##</code> operator</h2>
<p>
Another facility relied on in much current practice 
but not specified in the Base Document is
``<a name="token-pasting-3-8-3-3">token pasting</a>,''
or building a new token by macro argument substitution.&#160;<tt> </tt>
One existing implementation is to replace a comment within a macro expansion
by zero characters, instead of the single space called for in K&amp;R.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee considered this practice unacceptable.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
As with ``stringizing,''&#160;<tt> </tt>
the facility was considered desirable,
but not the extant implementation of this facility,
so the Committee invented another preprocessing operator.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The <code>##</code> operator within a macro expansion causes concatenation
of the tokens on either side of it into a new composite token.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The specification of this pasting operator is based on these
principles:
<ul><li>Paste operations are explicit in the source.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>The <code>##</code> operator is associative.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>A formal parameter as an operand for <code>##</code> is not expanded
	before pasting.  (The actual is substituted for the formal,
	but the actual is not expanded:
<pre>        #define a(n) aaa ## n
        #define b    2
</pre>	Given these definitions, the expansion of <code>a(b)</code> is
	<code>aaab</code>, not <code>aaa2</code> or <code>aaan</code>.)
<li>A normal operand for <code>##</code> is not expanded before pasting.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>Pasting does not cross macro replacement boundaries.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<li>The token resulting from a paste operation is subject to
	further macro expansion.&#160;<tt> </tt>
</ul>These principles codify the essential features of prior art,
and are consistent with the specification of the stringizing operator.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-3-4">3.8.3.4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Rescanning and further replacement</h2>
<p>
A problem faced by most current preprocessors is how to use a
macro name in its expansion without suffering ``recursive death.''&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee agreed simply to turn off the definition
of a macro for the duration
of the expansion of that macro.&#160;<tt> </tt>
An example of this feature is included in the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The rescanning rules incorporate an ambiguity.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Given the definitions
<pre>        #define  f(a)  a*g
        #define  g     f
</pre>it is clear (or at least unambiguous) that the expansion of
<code>f(2)(9)</code> is <code>2*f(9)</code> --- the <code>f</code> in the result clearly
was introduced during the expansion of the original <code>f</code>, so
is not further expanded.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
However, given the definitions
<pre>        #define f(a)  a*g
        #define g(a)  f(a)
</pre>the expansion rules allow the result to be either <code>2*f(9)</code> or
<code>2*9*g</code> --- it is unclear whether the <code>f(9)</code> token string
(resulting from the initial expansion of <code>f</code> and the examination
of the rest of the source file) should be considered as nested
within the expansion of <code>f</code> or not.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee intentionally left this behavior ambiguous:
it saw no useful purpose in specifying all the quirks of preprocessing
for such questionably useful constructs.
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-3-5">3.8.3.5</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Scope of macro definitions</h2>
<p>
Some pre-Standard implementations maintain a stack of <code>#define</code>
instances for each identifier;
<code>#undef</code> simply pops the stack.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The Committee agreed that more than one level of <code>#define</code>
was more prone to error than utility.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>

It is explicitly permitted to <code>#undef</code>
a macro that has no current definition.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This capability is exploited in conjunction with the standard library
(see <a href="d1.html#4-1-3">&#167;4.1.3</a>).&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-4">3.8.4</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Line control</h2>
Aside from giving values to <a name="-95-95LINE-95-95-3-8-4"><code>__LINE__</code></a> and <a name="-95-95FILE-95-95-3-8-4"><code>__FILE__</code></a>
(see <a href="c8.html#3-8-8">&#167;3.8.8</a>),
the effect of <code>#line</code> is <a name="unspecified-behavior-3-8-4">unspecified</a>.
A good implementation will presumably provide line
and file information in conjunction with most <a href="b.html#diagnostics-2-1-1-3" name="diagnostics-3-8-4">diagnostics</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-5">3.8.5</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Error directive</h2>
<p>
The directive <a name="-35error-3-8-5"><code>#error</code></a>
has been introduced to provide an explicit mechanism for
forcing translation to fail
under certain conditions.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(Formally the Standard only requires, <i>can</i> only require, that
a diagnostic be issued
when the <code>#error</code> directive is effected.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It is the intent of the Committee, however,
that translation cease immediately upon encountering this directive,
if this is feasible in the implementation;
further diagnostics on text beyond the directive are apt to be
of little value.)&#160;<tt> </tt>
Traditionally such failure has had to be forced by inserting text
so ill-formed that the translator gagged on it.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-6">3.8.6</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Pragma directive</h2>
<p>
The <a name="-35pragma-3-8-6"><code>#pragma</code></a>
directive has been added as the universal method for extending
the space of directives.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-7">3.8.7</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Null directive</h2>
<p>
The existing practice of using empty <code>#</code> lines
for spacing is supported in the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
<h2><a name="3-8-8">3.8.8</a>&#160;<tt> </tt>Predefined macro names</h2>
<p>
The rule that these macros may not be redefined or undefined
reduces the complexity of the name space that the programmer and
implementor must understand;
it recognizes that these macros have special built-in properties.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The macros <a name="-95-95DATE-95-95-3-8-8"><code>__DATE__</code></a> and <a name="-95-95TIME-95-95-3-8-8"><code>__TIME__</code></a>
have been added to make available the time of translation.&#160;<tt> </tt>
A particular format for the expansion of these macros has been specified
to aid in parsing strings initialized by them.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The macros <a name="-95-95LINE-95-95-3-8-8"><code>__LINE__</code></a> and <a name="-95-95FILE-95-95-3-8-8"><code>__FILE__</code></a>
have been added
to give programmers access to the source line number and file name.&#160;<tt> </tt>
<p>
The macro <a name="-95-95STDC-95-95-3-8-8"><code>__STDC__</code></a>
allows for conditional translation on whether the translator claims
to be standard-conforming or not.&#160;<tt> </tt>
It is defined as having value 1;
future versions of the Standard could define it as 2, 3, ...,
to allow for conditional compilation on which version of the Standard
a translator conforms to.&#160;<tt> </tt>
This macro should be of use in the transition toward conformance
to the Standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
