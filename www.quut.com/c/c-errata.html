Here is a newer version of the errata list than the one that
was reposted.&#160;<tt> </tt>It's not really new (mod date of the file is
Jan 91) and not much different, but does note the<br>p. 249
blemish.&#160;<tt> </tt>It's missing <a href="henry/index.html" name="henry">Henry

<h1><a name="main">Changes to</a><br>
The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition</h1>
<p>
     As the C standard wended its way through the approval
process and became final, <a href="bwk/index.html" name="bwk">Brian</a>
and I prepared fixes to put
in new printings of the second edition of  ``The C
Programming Language.''&#160;<tt> </tt>These printings are identified by a
large red ``ANSI C'' in the upper right quadrant.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Fortunately, the changes are minor; some repair our bugs, a
few account for last-minute changes in the draft standard.&#160;<tt> </tt>
For the benefit of previous and near-future purchasers, here
are the changes that were made:
<ul>
<li>
Two or three sentences in the Preface and Introduction are
updated to describe the state of the Standard.
<li>
<code>atof </code>is in<code> &lt;stdlib.h&gt;,</code> not<code> &lt;math.h&gt;</code>; this changes 71, 76, 82, 121.
<li>
On page 86, error corrected: elided initializers are <code>0</code>
for automatic as well as static variables.
<li>
On page 168: changed <code>1</code> to <code>1.0</code> to avoid potential overflow.
<li>
Minor typos are corrected on pages 87, 89, 164, 165, 168,
180.
<li>
The inconspicuous references to<code> noalias </code>on pages 192 and
211 are removed.
<li>
<a name="added-paragraph">The following paragraph is added to the end of section A6.6
(p 199):</a>
<blockquote>
     A pointer may be converted to another pointer whose
     type is the same except for the addition or removal of
     qualifiers (A4.4, A8.2) of the object type to which the
     pointer refers.&#160;<tt> </tt>If qualifiers are added, the new
     pointer is equivalent to the old except for
     restrictions implied by the new qualifiers.&#160;<tt> </tt>If
     qualifiers are removed, operations on the underlying
     object remain subject to the qualifiers in its actual
     declaration.
</blockquote>
<li>
On p. 199, beginning of section A6.8, ``Any pointer may be
converted to type <code>void  *</code>...'' is changed to ``Any pointer
&gt;to an object&lt; may be converted to type <code>void *</code>...''.
<li>
On p. 204, A7.4.4, ``The operand of the unary <code>+</code> operator
must have arithmetic or pointer type...'' should read ``must
have arithmetic type...''.
<li>
On p. 206, A7.9, about relational operators: ``Pointers to
objects of the same type may be compared...'' is changed to
``Pointers to object of the same type &gt;(ignoring any
qualifiers)&lt; may be compared...''.
<li>
The indented material on p. 209, ``According to the
restrictions...  relaxing it.'' is removed.&#160;<tt> </tt>[This is
related to <a href="c-errata.html#added-paragraph">the paragraph added above</a>.&#160;<tt> </tt>The wording of the
penultimate draft made it useless to take an <code>(int *)</code>
pointer, cast it to <code>(const int *)</code>, then cast it back to
<code>(int *)</code>.]
<li>
On p. 219 middle, initialization of structures, add
``Unnamed bit-field members are ignored, and are not
initialized.''
</ul>
<p>
Appendix B changes:
<ul>
<li>
p 242:  Add ``<code>fflush(NULL)</code> flushes all output streams.'' to
 <code>fflush</code> description.
<li>
p 243:  Change to ``it must be called before reading,
writing &gt;or any other operation&lt;'' in <code>setvbuf</code> description.
<li>
p 249:  Add ``Comparison functions treat arguments as
unsigned  char arrays.''  to  <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code> description.
<li>
p 255:  Change range of <code>tm_sec</code> to (0,61) for leap seconds.
<li>
p 255:  Change <code>CLK_TCK</code> to <code>CLOCKS_PER_SEC</code>.
<li>
p 257:  Drop  <code>U</code> and  <code>L</code> suffixes from  <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code> constants.
 <code>tm_sec</code> range is (00,61) here too.
</ul>
Appendix C change:
<ul>
<li>
p 261:  Change ``External declarations without any
specifiers...'' to ``External &gt;data&lt; declarations without
any specifiers...''.
</ul>
The index has been reprinted to fix a couple of typos and
account for motion within Appendix A; one page of the table
of contents is changed.
<p>
<p>
October, 1989:
<ul>
<li>Minor changes on page 131 to add &amp; to last
example,
<li>on page 208 to change ``equal'' to ``unequal'' in
the description of logical OR,
<li>and on page 254 to clarify
that only volatile automatics are saved with <code>longjmp</code>.
</ul>
<p>
Not yet fixed in any printing:
<ul>
<li>
page 53: Note under the table should say <code>&amp;</code> as well as  <code>+ - *</code>
has higher precedence as a unary operator.
<li>
page 111: indent is too large, and a bit of program text is
cut off.
<li>
page 231  extra right paren in nested call to <code>cat</code> macro.
<li>
page 246: first argument of<code> sscanf </code>should have type
<code> const char *</code>.
<li>
page 249: in description of <code>strncpy</code>, <code>t =&gt; ct</code>.
</ul>
