<dd>
	This collaboration between Cornell University and AT&amp;T Labs Research
	adds special flavors of pointers to C99 to allow for checks against
	dangling, null, and bogus pointers.  Combined with a few other
	features the implementors wanted (tagged unions, language support for
	polymorphism, exceptions, new for arrays, type inference, templates)
	this is one entry in the race for a "better C" 
	that stays refreshingly clear of object-oriented concepts.

	Through the occasionally outdated documentation shimmers a gleeful
	anti-C-bias; the directory in the programmer's guide that
	contains a comparison between Java and C/C++ is
	called "noMoreC."

<dd>	pC++ is a language extension to C++ that allows invoking
	member functions of an entire collection of elements
	in parallel.&#160;<tt> </tt>It is implemented as a combination
	of run&#173;time library and pC++ to C++ preprocessor, and
	is part of a larger system developed at the University of Indiana
	around the object&#173;oriented preprocessor toolkit Sage++.

	Since Swarm, the project 
	<a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~nelson/">Nelson Minar</a>
	was working on at the Santa Fe Institute, is written
	in Objective C, he has started an index page for the language.
	These days, Alex Lancaster maintains it as part
	of the Swarm project; Nelson has moved on to the MediaLab.

<dd>	UC Berkeley's parallel extension of C implements
	a shared global address space on distributed memory
	multiprocessors.&#160;<tt> </tt>With its small set of
	global access primitives and parallel storage layout
	declarations, the language was intended to be
	as simple and predictable as its ancestor.

<dd>	C++ compiler hacker Walter Bright's "Digital Mars" has turned out
	a language heavily influenced by C++ and Java that Walter and a
	growing group of afficionados are convinced will be "the next C."
