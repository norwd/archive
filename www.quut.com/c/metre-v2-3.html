<h1>Metre v2.3</h1>

Metre is a freely distributable ANSI/ISO Standard C parser whose behavior is
determined by a set of rules. Sets are provided for a metrics tool and a
call-tree tool. Written in Standard C, lex, and yacc, it is source-code
portable across operating systems, Standard C compilers, and the various
flavors of lex and yacc. The documentation includes man pages.
<p>
<b>Availability</b> - Metre v2.3 is available 
	via
anonymous FTP from the comp.compilers archive,
	<a href="ftp://iecc.com/pub/file/metre.tar.gz"
		>iecc.com:pub/file/metre.tar.gz</a>.
<p>
<b>Building Tools</b> - Compile the two parser files and one of the rules files with
a Standard C compiler and then link their objects together. UNIX and MS-DOS
makefiles are included. I provide the parser files that were generated by MKS
lex/yacc, but if you want to modify the parser and have a lex/yacc, you can
regenerate them. Rules files are provided for a tool that prints call trees,
Mtree, and a metrics tool, which is called Metre ("Metre" is the name of the
entire package and the metrics tool--it is overloaded). You can modify these
rules or write your own.
<p>
<b>Metre Metrics Tool</b> - Reports the minimum, maximum, average, and total of the
following metrics at the function, module, and project level. Metre also
warns about dubious programming practices, such as using the goto statement.
This and other behavior can be easily changed, however, by modifying the
rules to reflect your own concept of what good programming is.

<ul>
<li> Halstead's length, vocabulary, volume, level, effort, intelligence
      content, programming time, and language level
<li> Number of source, code, comment, and blank lines
<li> Number of executable, declaration, and preprocessor statements
<li> Backfired function points
<li> Maximum control depth
<li> Identifier count and length
<li> Number of functions and modules
</ul>
<p>
<b>Mtree Call-Tree Tool</b> - Mtree prints a call graph as an annotated, indented
tree of function names. From the command line, you can name the root
function, suppress tree lines, select alternate line characters, specify
indention and width of file-name margin, and specify whether to print the
table of contents and whether to ignore library calls.
