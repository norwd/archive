<p>
Brian W. Kernighan is head of the Computing Structures Research Department,
Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey.&#160;<tt> </tt>
He received a B.A.Sc in
engineering physics from the University of Toronto in 1964, and a Ph.D. in
electrical engineering from Princeton University in 1969.&#160;<tt> </tt>
Since joining Bell
Labs in 1969, he has worked in combinatorial optimization, document
preparation systems, programming languages, and software tools.&#160;<tt> </tt>
His current research interests are in application-oriented programming
languages,
programming methodology, and user interfaces.
<p>
Dr. Kernighan is the co-author of several books, including
``The C Programming Language'' and
``The UNIX Programming Environment''.

Brian Kernighan is in the Computing Science Research Center at Murray Hill,
where he has been in the same office since 1969.&#160;<tt> </tt>
(It has been painted
once.)&#160;<tt> </tt> He writes programs and occasionally
books.&#160;<tt> </tt>
The latter are better
than the former, and certainly need less maintenance.

<dd>Many people (even <a href="../duffs-device.html#bwk">bwk</a>?)
    have said that the worst feature of C is that switches don't break
    automatically before each case label.

<p>
<dt>Mark Brader on the B Language
<dd>Also in 1969, the system that <a href="../msb-on-b.html#bwk">Brian
Kernighan</a> would later name Unix was being developed by Ken
Thompson &quot;with some assistance from&quot; Dennis Ritchie.

<dt>Rob Pike
<dd>With Bart Locanthi he designed the Blit terminal;
with <a href="../rob/index.html#bwk">Brian Kernighan</a> he wrote
<i>The Unix Programming Environment</i>.
<p>
<dt>The ANSI C Rationale
<dd>The vast majority of the language defined by the Standard is precisely the
same as is defined in Appendix A of
<i>The C Programming Language</i>
by <a href="../rat/a.html#Kernighan-44-Brian-1-1">Brian Kernighan</a>
and Dennis Ritchie,
and as is implemented in almost all C translators.
