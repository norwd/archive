<p>
The <a href="msb-on-b.html">notes by Mark Brader</a>, <a href="alan-on-bcpl.html">Alan Watson</a>, and <a href="clive-on-history.html#intro" name="clive">Clive Feather</a> about the
relationships between BCPL, B and C are substantially correct, though
naturally there are a few nits to pick.&#160;<tt> </tt>I won't, here.&#160;<tt> </tt><a name="why-reform">There's one
thing to note--</a> B was created (by Thompson) well before <a href="alan-on-bcpl.html#the-book">the book by
Richards and Whitby-Strevens</a>
<!--book-->
was published, and at least some of
the differences between BCPL and B owe to divergent evolution, not
deliberate change (though many do not).
<p>
I wrote a paper for the second History of Programming Languages
conference in Cambridge (Mass) last April on the development of C, and
it discusses how typeless BCPL and B evolved into C.&#160;<tt> </tt>It's in SIGPLAN
Notices from about that time, and the whole proceedings and the
discussions are being gathered into a book by ACM.&#160;<tt> </tt>(I will then see if
I really said that teaching C as an introductory language would be a
calamity, as someone quotes Dr. Dobbs as quoting me.&#160;<tt> </tt>Could I really use
that word?)
<p>
I finally put the text of the paper up for anonymous ftp and netlib.<br>
To get the (100KB) <a href="chistory.ps">Postscript version</a> by e-mail, send mail to
<p>
<blockquote>
        netlib@research.att.com
</blockquote>
<p>
with the message body
<p>
<blockquote>
        send chistory.ps from research/memo
</blockquote>
<p>
To retrieve it by anonymous FTP, log into research.att.com in the
usual way, and get netlib/research/memo/chistory.ps.Z , which is the compressed
Postscript (46KB).
