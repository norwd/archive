Remark. &#151; If it be found impraticable to print works with the diacritical
signs (^,&nbsp;), the letter h may be substituted for the sign (^), and the sign
(&nbsp;), may be altogether omitted.

<P>

<H4>B)  PARTS OF SPEECH</H4>

<B>1.</B>  There is no indefinite, and only one definite, article, &quot;la&quot;, for all
genders, numbers, and cases.

<P>

<B>2.</B>  Substantives are formed by adding &quot;o&quot; to the root.  For the plural,
the letter &quot;j&quot; must be added to the singular.  There are two cases:
the nominative and the objective (accusative).  The root with the added &quot;o&quot;
is the nominative, the objective adds an &quot;n&quot; after the &quot;o&quot;.  Other cases
are formed by prepositions; thus, the possessive (genitive) by &quot;de&quot;, &quot;of&quot;;
the dative by &quot;al&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, the instrumental (ablative) by &quot;kun&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, or
other prepositions as the sense demands.  E.g. root &quot;patr&quot;, &quot;father&quot;;
&quot;la patr'o&quot;, &quot;the father&quot;; &quot;la patr'o'n&quot;, &quot;the father&quot; (objective),
&quot;de la patr'o&quot;, &quot;of the father&quot;; &quot;al la patr'o&quot;, &quot;to the father&quot;;
&quot;kun la patr'o&quot;, &quot;with the father&quot;; &quot;la patr'o'j&quot;, &quot;the fathers&quot;;
&quot;la patr'o'j'n&quot;, &quot;the fathers&quot; (obj.); &quot;por la patr'o'j&quot;,
&quot;for the fathers&quot;.

<P>

<B>3.</B>  Adjectives are formed by adding &quot;a&quot; to the root.  The numbers and
cases are the same as in the substantives.  The comparative degree is
formed by prefixing &quot;pli&quot; (more); the superlative by &quot;plej&quot; (most).
The word &quot;than&quot; is rendered by &quot;ol&quot;, e.g. &quot;pli blank'a ol ne&#285;'o&quot;,
&quot;whiter than snow&quot;.

<P>

<B>4.</B>  The cardinal numerals do not change their forms for the different
cases.  They are:
  &quot;unu&quot; (1), &quot;du&quot; (2), &quot;tri&quot; (3), &quot;kvar&quot; (4), &quot;kvin&quot; (5), &quot;ses&quot; (6),
&quot;sep&quot; (7), &quot;ok&quot; (8), &quot;na&#365;&quot; (9), &quot;dek&quot; (10), &quot;cent&quot; (100), &quot;mil&quot; (1000).<BR>

  The tens and hundreds are formed by simple junction of the numerals,
e.g. 533 = &quot;kvin'cent tri'dek' tri&quot;.<BR>

  Ordinals are formed by adding the adjectival &quot;a&quot; to the cardinals,
e.g. &quot;unu'a&quot;, &quot;first&quot;; &quot;du'a&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, etc.<BR>

  Multiplicatives (as &quot;threefold&quot;, &quot;fourfold&quot;, etc.) add &quot;obl&quot;,
e.g. &quot;tri'obl'a&quot;, &quot;threefold&quot;.<BR>

  Fractions add &quot;on&quot;, as &quot;du'on'o&quot;, &quot;a half&quot;; &quot;kvar'on'o&quot;, &quot;a quarter&quot;.<BR>

Collective numerals add &quot;op&quot;, as &quot;kvar'op'e&quot;, &quot;four together&quot;.<BR>

  Distributive prefix &quot;po&quot;, e.g., &quot;po kvin&quot;, &quot;five apiece&quot;.<BR>

  Adverbials take &quot;e&quot;, e.g. &quot;unu'e&quot;, &quot;firstly&quot;, etc.<BR>

<P>

<B>5.</B>  The personal pronouns are: &quot;mi&quot;, I; &quot;vi&quot;, thou, you; &quot;li&quot;, he;
&quot;&#349;i&quot;, she; &quot;&#285;i&quot;, it; &quot;si&quot;, &quot;self&quot;; &quot;ni&quot;, &quot;we&quot;; &quot;ili&quot;, &quot;they&quot;;
&quot;oni&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;people&quot;, (French &quot;on&quot;).

  Possessive pronouns are formed by suffixing to the required personal,
the adjectival termination.  The declension of the pronouns is identical
with that of substantives.  E.g. &quot;mi&quot;, &quot;I&quot;; &quot;mi'n&quot;, &quot;me&quot; (obj.);
&quot;mi'a&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, &quot;mine&quot;.

<P>

<B>6.</B>  The verb does not change its form for numbers or persons, e.g.
&quot;mi far'as&quot;, &quot;I do&quot;; &quot;la patr'o far'as&quot;, &quot;the father does&quot;; &quot;ili far'as&quot;,
&quot;they do&quot;.

Forms of the Verb:

<P>

a)  The present tense ends in &quot;as&quot;, e.g. &quot;mi far'as&quot;, &quot;I do&quot;.<BR>

b)  The past tense ends in &quot;is&quot;, e.g. &quot;li far'is&quot;, &quot;he did&quot;.<BR>

c)  The future tense ends in &quot;os&quot;, e.g. &quot;ili far'os&quot;, &quot;they will do&quot;.<BR>

&#265;) The subjunctive mood ends in &quot;us&quot;, e.g. &quot;&#349;i far'us&quot;, &quot;she may do&quot;.<BR>

d)  The imperative mood ends in &quot;u&quot;, e.g. &quot;ni far'u&quot;, &quot;let us do&quot;.<BR>

e)  The infinitive mood ends in &quot;i&quot;, e.g. &quot;fari&quot;, &quot;to do&quot;.
There are two forms of the participle in the international language,
the changeable or adjectival, and the unchangable or adverbial.<BR>

f)  The present participle active ends in &quot;ant&quot;, e.g. &quot;far'ant'a&quot;,
&quot;he who is doing&quot;; &quot;far'ant'e&quot;, &quot;doing&quot;.<BR>

g)  The past participle active ends in &quot;int&quot;, e.g. &quot;far'int'a&quot;,
&quot;he who has done&quot;; &quot;far'int'e&quot;, &quot;having done&quot;.<BR>

&#285;) The future participle active ends in &quot;ont&quot;, e.g. &quot;far'ont'a&quot;,
&quot;he who will do&quot;; &quot;far'ont'e&quot;, &quot;about to do&quot;.<BR>

h)  The present participle passive ends in &quot;at&quot;, e.g. &quot;far'at'e&quot;,
&quot;being done&quot;.<BR>

&#293;) The past participle passive ends in &quot;it&quot;, e.g. &quot;far'it'a&quot;,
&quot;that which has been done&quot;; &quot;far'it'e&quot;, &quot;having been done&quot;.<BR>

i)  The future particple passive ends in &quot;ot&quot;, e.g. &quot;far'ot'a&quot;,
&quot;that which will be done&quot;; &quot;far'ot'e&quot;, &quot;about to be done&quot;.<BR>

<P>

All forms of the passive are rendered by the respective forms of the
verb &quot;est&quot; (to be) and the participle passive of the required verb;
the preposition used is &quot;de&quot;, &quot;by&quot;.  E.g. &quot;&#349;i est'as am'at'a de
&#265;iu'j&quot;, &quot;she is loved by every one&quot;.

<P>

<B>7.</B>  Adverbs are formed by adding &quot;e&quot; to the root.  The degrees of
comparison are the same as in adjectives, e.g. &quot;mi'a frat'o kant'as
pli bon'e ol mi&quot;, &quot;my brother sings better than I&quot;.

<P>

<B>8.</B>  All prepositions govern the nominative case.

<P>

<H4>C)  GENERAL RULES</H4>

<B>9.</B>  Every word is to be read exactly as written; there are no silent
letters.

<P>

<B>10.</B>  The accent falls on the last syllable but one, (penultimate).

<P>

<B>11.</B>  Compound words are formed by the simple junction of roots, (the
principal word standing last), which are written as a single word,
but, in elementary works, separated by a small line (').  Grammatical
terminations are considered as independent words.  E.g. &quot;vapor'&#349;ip'o&quot;,
&quot;steamboat&quot; is composed of the roots &quot;vapor&quot;, &quot;steam&quot;, and &quot;&#349;ip&quot;,
&quot;a boat&quot;, with the substantival termination &quot;o&quot;.

<P>

<B>12.</B>  If there be one negative in a clause, a second is not admissible.

<P>

<B>13.</B>  In phrases answering the question &quot;where?&quot; (meaning direction),
the words take the termination of the objective case; e.g. &quot;kie'n
vi ir'as?&quot; &quot;where are you going?&quot;; &quot;dom'o'n&quot;, &quot;home&quot;; &quot;London'o'n&quot;,
&quot;to London&quot;, etc.

<P>

<B>14.</B>  Every preposition in the international language has a definite
fixed meaning.  If it be necessary to employ some preposition, and it
is not quite evident from the sense which it should be, the word &quot;je&quot;
is used, which has no definite meaning; for example, &quot;&#285;oj'i je tio&quot;,
&quot;to rejoice over it&quot;; &quot;rid'i je tio&quot;, &quot;to laugh at it&quot;; &quot;enu'o je
la patr'uj'o&quot;, &quot;a longing for one's fatherland&quot;.  In every language
different prepositions, sanctioned by usage, are employed in these
dubious cases, in the international language, one word, &quot;je&quot;, suffices
for all.  Instead of &quot;je&quot;, the objective without a preposition may
be used, when no confusion is to be feared.

<P>

<B>15.</B>  The so-called &quot;foreign&quot; words, i.e. words which the greater
number of languages have derived from the same source, undergo no
change in the international language, beyond conforming to its
system of orthography. -- Such is the rule with regard to primary
words, derivatives are better formed (from the primary word) according
to the rules of the international grammar, e.g. &quot;teatr'o&quot;, &quot;theatre&quot;,
but &quot;teatr'a&quot;, &quot;theatrical&quot;, (not &quot;teatrical'a&quot;), etc.

<P>

<B>16.</B>  The &quot;a&quot; of the article, and the final &quot;o&quot; of substantives,
may be sometimes dropped euphoniae gratia, e.g. &quot;de l' mond'o&quot; for
&quot;de la mond'o&quot;; &quot;&#348;iller'&quot; for &quot;&#348;iller'o&quot;; in such cases an apostrophe
should be substituted for the discarded vowel.
