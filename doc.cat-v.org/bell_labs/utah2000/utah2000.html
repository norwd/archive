    <h1>A Polemic</h1>

    <p>This talk is a polemic that distills the pessimistic side of
    my feelings about systems research these days. I won't talk
    much about the optimistic side, since lots of others can do
    that for me; everyone's excited about the computer industry. I
    may therefore present a picture somewhat darker than
    reality.</p>

    <p>However, I think the situation is genuinely bad and requires
    action.</p>

    <h1>Definitions</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Systems:</dt>

      <dd>Operating systems, networking, languages; the things that
      connect programs together.</dd>

      <dt>Software:</dt>

      <dd>As you expect.</dd>

      <dt>Research:</dt>

      <dd>Primarily academic research -- universities and a few
      industrial labs.</dd>

      <dt>Is:</dt>

      <dd>Now, not ten years ago, and I hope not in another ten
      years.</dd>

      <dt>Irrelevant:</dt>

      <dd>Does not influence industry.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h1>Thesis</h1>

    <p>Systems software research has become a sideline to the
    excitement in the computing industry.</p>

    <p>When did you last see an exciting non-commercial demo?</p>

    <p>Ironically, at a time when computing is almost the
    definition of innovation, research in both software and
    hardware at universities and much of industry is becoming
    insular, ossified, and irrelevant.</p>

    <p>There are many reasons, some avoidable, some endemic.</p>

    <p>There may be ways to improve the situation, but they will
    require a community-wide effort.</p>

    <h1>A Field in Decline</h1>

    <p>"Who needs new operating systems, anyway?" you ask. Maybe no
    one, but then that supports my thesis.</p>

    <p>"But now there are lots of papers in file systems,
    performance, security, Web caching, etc.," you say. Yes, but is
    anyone outside the research field paying attention?</p>

    <p>Hardware has changed dramatically; software is stagnant.</p>

    <h1>Where is the Innovation?</h1>

    <p>Microsoft, mostly. Exercise: Compare 1990 Microsoft software
    with 2000.</p>

    <p>If you claim that's not innovation, but copying, I reply
    that Java is to C++ as Windows is to the Macintosh: an
    industrial response to an interesting but technically flawed
    piece of systems software.</p>

    <p>If systems research was relevant, we'd see new operating
    systems and new languages making inroads into the industry, the
    way we did in the '70s and '80s.</p>

    <p>Instead, we see a thriving software industry that largely
    ignores research, and a research community that writes papers
    rather than software.</p>

    <h1>Linux</h1>

    <p>Innovation? New? No, it's just another copy of the same old
    stuff.</p>

    <p><i>OLD</i> stuff. Compare program development on Linux with
    Microsoft Visual Studio or one of the IBM Java/Web
    toolkits.</p>

    <p>Linux's success may indeed be the single strongest argument
    for my thesis: The excitement generated by a clone of a
    decades-old operating system demonstrates the void that the
    systems software research community has failed to fill.</p>

    <p>Besides, Linux's cleverness is not in the software, but in
    the development model, hardly a triumph of academic CS
    (especially software engineering) by any measure.</p>

    <h1>What is Systems Research these days?</h1>

    <p>Web caches, Web servers, file systems, network packet
    delays, all that stuff. Performance, peripherals, and
    applications, but not kernels or even user-level
    applications.</p>

    <p>Mostly, though, it's just a lot of measurement, a
    misinterpretation and misapplication of the scientific
    method.</p>

    <p>Too much phenomenology: invention has been replaced by
    observation. Today we see papers comparing interrupt latency on
    Linux vs. Windows. They may be interesting, they may even be
    relevant, but they aren't research.</p>

    <p>In a misguided attempt to seem scientific, there's too much
    measurement: performance minutiae and bad charts.</p>

    <p>By contrast, a new language or OS can make the machine
    <i>feel</i> different, give excitement, <i>novelty</i>. But
    today that's done by a cool Web site or a higher CPU clock rate
    or some cute little device that should be a computer but
    isn't.</p>

    <p>The <i>art</i> is gone.</p>

    <p>But art is not science, and that's part of the point.
    Systems research cannot be just science; there must be
    engineering, design, and art.</p>

    <h1>What Happened?</h1>

    <p>A lot of things:</p>

    <h2>PC</h2>

    <p>Hardware became cheap, and cheap hardware became good.
    Eventually, if it didn't run on a PC, it didn't matter because
    the average, mean, median, and mode computer was a PC.</p>

    <p>Even into the 1980s, much systems work revolved around new
    architectures (RISC, iAPX/432, Lisp Machines). No more. A major
    source of interesting problems and, perhaps, interesting
    solutions is gone.</p>

    <p>Much systems work also revolved around making stuff work
    <i>across</i> architectures: portability. But when hardware's
    all the same, it's a non-issue.</p>

    <p>Plan 9 may be the most portable operating system in the
    world. We're about to do a new release, for the PC only. (For
    old time's sake, we'll include source for other architectures,
    but expect almost no one will use it.)</p>

    <p>And that's just the PC as hardware; as software, it's the
    same sort of story.</p>

    <h2>Microsoft</h2>

    <p>Enough has been said about this topic. (Although people will
    continue to say lots more.)</p>

    <p>Microsoft is an easy target, but it's a scapegoat, not the
    real source of difficulty.</p>

    <p>Details to follow.</p>

    <h2>Web</h2>

    <p>The Web happened in the early 1990s and it surprised the
    computer science community as much as the commercial one.</p>

    <p>It then came to dominate much of the discussion, but not to
    much effect. Business controls it. (The Web came from
    physicists and prospered in industry.)</p>

    <p>Bruce Lindsay of IBM: HDLC ~= HTTP/HTML; 3270s have been
    replaced by Web browsers. (Compare with Visicalc and PC.)</p>

    <p>Research has contributed little, despite a huge flow of
    papers on caches, proxies, server architectures, etc.</p>

    <h2>Standards</h2>

    <p>To be a viable computer system, one must honor a huge list
    of large, and often changing, standards: TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML,
    XML, CORBA, Unicode, POSIX, NFS, SMB, MIME, POP, IMAP, X,
    ...</p>

    <p>A huge amount of work, but if you don't honor the standards,
    you're marginalized.</p>

    <p>I estimate that 90-95% of the work in Plan 9 was directly or
    indirectly to honor externally imposed standards.</p>

    <p>At another level, instruction architectures, buses, etc.
    have the same influence.</p>

    <p>With so much externally imposed structure, there's little
    slop left for novelty.</p>

    <p>Even worse, commercial companies that "own" standards, such
    as Microsoft and Cisco, deliberately make standards hard to
    comply with, to frustrate competition. Academia is a
    casualty.</p>

    <h2>Orthodoxy</h2>

    <p>Today's graduating PhDs use Unix, X, Emacs, and Tex. That's
    their world. It's often the only computing world they've ever
    used for technical work.</p>

    <p>Twenty years ago, a student would have been exposed to a
    wide variety of operating systems, all with good and bad
    points.</p>

    <p>New employees in our lab now bring their world with them, or
    expect it to be there when they arrive. That's reasonable, but
    there was a time when joining a new lab was a chance to explore
    new ways of working.</p>

    <p>Narrowness of experience leads to narrowness of
    imagination.</p>

    <p>The situation with languages is a little better -- many
    curricula include exposure to functional languages, etc. -- but
    there is also a language orthodoxy: C++ and Java.</p>

    <p>In science, we reserve our highest honors for those who
    prove we were wrong. But in computer science...</p>

    <h2>Change of scale</h2>

    <p>With so many external constraints, and so many things
    already done, much of the interesting work requires effort on a
    large scale. Many person-years are required to write a modern,
    realistic system. That is beyond the scope of most university
    departments.</p>

    <p>Also, the time scale is long: from design to final version
    can be five years. Again, that's beyond the scope of most grad
    students.</p>

    <p>This means that industry tends to do the big, defining
    projects -- operating systems, infrastructure, etc. -- and
    small research groups must find smaller things to work on.</p>

    <p>Three trends result:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Don't build, measure. (Phenomenology, not new
      things.)</li>

      <li>Don't go for breadth, go for depth. (Microspecialization,
      not <i>systems</i> work.)</li>

      <li>Take an existing thing and tweak it.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I believe this is the main explanation of the SOSP
    curve.</p>

    <h2>Unix</h2>

    <p>New operating systems today tend to be just ways of
    reimplementing Unix. If they have a novel architecture -- and
    some do -- the first thing to build is the Unix emulation
    layer.</p>

    <p>How can operating systems research be relevant when the
    resulting operating systems are all indistinguishable?</p>

    <p>There was a claim in the late 1970s and early 1980s that
    Unix had killed operating systems research because no one would
    try anything else. At the time, I didn't believe it. Today, I
    grudgingly accept that the claim may be true (Microsoft
    notwithstanding).</p>

    <p>A victim of its own success: portability led to ubiquity.
    That meant architecture didn't matter, so now there's only
    one.</p>

    <p>Linux is the hot new thing... but it's just another
    Unix.</p>

    <h2>Linux -- the Academic Microsoft Windows</h2>

    <p>The holy trinity: Linux, <tt>gcc</tt>, and Netscape.</p>

    <p>Of course, it's just another orthodoxy.</p>

    <p>These have become icons not because of what they are, but
    because of what they are <i>not</i>: Microsoft.</p>

    <p>But technically, they're not that hot. And Microsoft has
    been working hard, and I claim that on many (not all)
    dimensions, their corresponding products are superior
    technically. And they continue to improve.</p>

    <p>Linux may fall into the Macintosh trap: smug isolation
    leading to (near) obsolescence.</p>

    <p>Besides, systems research is doing little to advance the
    trinity.</p>

    <h2>Startups</h2>

    <p>Startups are the dominant competition for academia for
    ideas, funds, personnel, and students. (Others are Microsoft,
    big corporations, legions of free hackers, and the IETF.)</p>

    <p>In response, government-funded and especially corporate
    research is directed at very fast "return on investment".</p>

    <p>This distorts the priorities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Research is bent towards what can make big money (IPO) in
      a year.</li>

      <li>The horizon is too short for long-term work. (There go
      infrastructure and the problems of scale.)</li>

      <li>Funding sources (government, industry) perceive the same
      pressures, so there is a vicious circle.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The metric of merit is wrong.</p>

    <p>Stanford now encourages students to go to startups because
    successful CEOs give money to the campus. The new president of
    Stanford is a successful computer entrepreneur.</p>

    <h2>Grandma</h2>

    <p>Grandma's online.</p>

    <p>This means that the industry is designing systems and
    services for ordinary people. The focus is on applications and
    devices, not on infrastructure and architecture, the domain of
    systems research.</p>

    <p>The cause is largely marketing, the result a proliferation
    of incompatible devices. You can't make money on software, only
    hardware, so design a niche gimmick, not a Big New Idea.</p>

    <p>Programmability -- once the Big Idea in computing -- has
    fallen by the wayside.</p>

    <p>Again, systems research loses out.</p>

    <h1>Things to Do</h1>

    <p>Startups are too focused on short time scale and practical
    results to try new things. Big corporations are too focused on
    existing priorities to try new things. Startups suck energy
    from research. But gold rushes leave ghost towns; be prepared
    to move in.</p>

    <p>"Why do you use Plan 9?"</p>

    <p>Go back to thinking about and <i>building systems</i>.
    Narrowness is irrelevant; breadth is relevant: it's the essence
    of <i>system</i>.</p>

    <p>Work on how systems behave and work, not just how they
    compare. Concentrate on interfaces and architecture, not just
    engineering.</p>

    <p>Be courageous. Try different things; experiment. <i>Try to
    give a cool demo.</i></p>

    <p>Funding bodies: fund more courageously, particularly
    long-term projects. Universities, in turn, should explore ways
    to let students contribute to long-term projects.</p>

    <p>Measure success by ideas, not just papers and money. Make
    the industry <i>want</i> your work.</p>

    <h1>Things to Build</h1>

    <p>There are lots of valid, useful, interesting things to do. I
    offer a small sample as evidence. If the field is moribund,
    it's not from a lack of possibilities.</p>

    <p>Only one GUI has ever been seriously tried, and its best
    ideas date from the 1970s. (In some ways, it's been getting
    worse; today the screen is covered with confusing little
    pictures.) Surely there are other possibilities. (Linux's
    interface isn't even as good as Windows!)</p>

    <p>There has been much talk about component architectures but
    only one true success: Unix pipes. It should be possible to
    build interactive and distributed applications from piece
    parts.</p>

    <p>The future is distributed computation, but the language
    community has done very little to address that possibility.</p>

    <p>The Web has dominated how systems present and use
    information: the model is forced interaction; the user must go
    get it. Let's go back to having the data come to the user
    instead.</p>

    <p>System administration remains a deeply difficult problem.
    Unglamorous, sure, but there's plenty of room to make a huge,
    even commercial, contribution.</p>

    <h1>Conclusions</h1>

    <p>The world has decided how it wants computers to be. The
    systems software research community influenced that decision
    somewhat, but very little, and now it is shut out of the
    discussion.</p>

    <p>It has reached the point where I doubt that a brilliant
    systems project would even be funded, and if funded, wouldn't
    find the bodies to do the work. The odds of success were always
    low; now they're essentially zero.</p>

    <p>The community -- universities, students, industry, funding
    bodies -- must change its priorities.</p>

    <p>The community must accept and explore unorthodox ideas.</p>

    <p>The community must separate research from market
    capitalization.</p>
