<div class="abstract">
The TILT compiler for Standard ML is type-directed and
type-preserving, that is, it makes use of and translates type
information during the phases of compilation. Unfortunately, such use
of type data incurs a significant overhead. This paper explores
methods for abstractly, conveniently, and efficiently storing and
manipulating type information in TILT. In the end, we discover that
doing /more/ work to reduce overhead is a bad strategy for this
situation.
