<p> <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>

<p>
<div class="abstract">
<p>In previous work we presented a foundational calculus for
spatially distributed computing based on intuitionistic modal logic.
With the modalities &#9744; and &#9826; we were able to capture two
key invariants: the mobility of portable code and the locality of
fixed resources.</p>

<p>This work investigates issues in distributed control flow through a
similar propositions-as-types interpretation of <i>classical</i> modal
logic. The resulting programming language is enhanced with the notion
of a network-wide continuation, through which we can give
computational interpretation of classical theorems (such as &#9744;A
&#8801; &#172;&#9826;&#172;A). Such continuations are also useful
primitives for building higher-level constructs of distributed
computing. The resulting system is elegant, logically faithful, and
computationally reasonable.</p>
