<p> <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>

<p>
<div class="abstract">
We present a foundational language for distributed programming, called
Lambda 5, that addresses both mobility of code and locality of resources.
<p>In order to construct our system, we appeal to the powerful
propositions-as-types interpretation of logic. Specifically, we
take the possible worlds of the intuitionistic modal logic IS5 to
be nodes on a network, and the connectives Box and Dia to reflect
mobility and locality, respectively.
<p>We formulate a novel system of natural deduction for IS5, decomposing
the introduction and elimination rules for Box and Dia, thereby
allowing the corresponding programs to be more direct.  We then give an
operational semantics to our calculus that is type-safe, logically
faithful, and computationally realistic.
