<p>I wrote a novel as part of the 2003 <b><a
href="http://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a></b>
project. The rules are simple: produce a 50,000 word novel in the
month of November. To succeed I had to give up all other <b><a
href="http://radar.spacebar.org/">projects</a></b> and spend many
long evenings, but I did succeed, and you can download my novel
<b>Name of Author by Title of Book</b> to see for yourself!

<p>Here's how to get it:

<p><b><a href="noabtob.pdf">noabtob.pdf</a></b> (911k). Downloadable
PDF of the book. Formatted for 6x9&quot; paper, so it might be tricky
to print. But it should view fine in Acrobat.

<p>Lulu.com will <b><a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/tom-murphy/name-of-author-by-title-of-book/paperback/product-1k9n25.html">print
a copy</a></b>, with color cover and softcover binding, for about ten
bucks including shipping. I don't make any money off this, it's just a
convenient way to get a printed copy.

<p><b><a
href="noabtob-partyversion.pdf.bz2.rar.ARJ.tar">noabtob-partyversion.pdf.bz2.rar.ARJ.tar</a></b>
(800k). I'm not actually stupid enough to use 4 different compression
programs on top of a format that already does its own compression.
This is the "party version," the version of my novel that was finished
on the night of 30 November 2003. It's compressed using a bunch of
different programs to discourage you from downloading it. Really you
should get the finished version above.

<p>If you like my book, <b><a
href="http://radar.spacebar.org/f/a/weblog/comment/1/580">leave me a
comment</a></b>! Also related are my numerous <b><a
href="http://crapart.spacebar.org/aad/">albums that I made in a single
day</a></b>, and my follow-up 2004 novel, <b><a
href="../novel2/index.html">His Sophomoric Effort</a></b>.
