<title>The FixederSys font family</title>
<div style="width:800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; padding:1em">
<p>My favorite terminal font is the venerable FixedSys, but it does
have a few small problems, such as not working on modern computers.
Here are some TrueType versions I made. They are exact (as in the
vectors trace out the outlines of the pixels, exactly on integer
coordinates like you want) if you set them to the correct size and
turn off anti-aliasing. In Photoshop, for example, use multiples of
"16 pt". In CSS, "16px" may work well. Alas, the correct size may
differ based on the application or settings like your monitor DPI. On
high-DPI displays, FixederSys 1x looks good at twice its native size
(chunky pixels), but FixederSys 2x is designed to look both crisp and
familiar at high resolutions. The 2x version is what I use for my
terminals and editors on a 4k monitor.</p>

<p><a href="FixederSys1x.ttf">FixederSys 1x</a> - This is the original
  FixedSys with some tweaks and extensions.

  <div class="detail">&hearts;&nbsp;I've added a bunch of
	Unicode characters (Latin 1 and Extended A, some emoji, Greek,
	Katakana, Cyrillic, math symbols).
	All characters are 9x16 pixels, even (for now?) double-width characters.
  </div>
</p>

<p><a href="FixederSys2x.ttf">FixederSys 2x</a> - This is like the
  original FixedSys, but I have doubled the resolution and then
  manually improved the pixels to make use of the finer grid. I still
  tried to keep it looking "like a terminal font," and it is purely
  a pixel font. This one should be used at twice the size of the
  1x version (or integer multiples, if you have a realllly high-resolution
  display).
  <div class="detail">&hearts;&nbsp;All characters are 18x32 pixels.
  </div>
  <div class="detail">&hearts;&nbsp;Some extended characters are just
	2x versions of the glyphs from the 1x font because I haven't
	gotten around to hand-tweaking them yet.
  </div>
</p>

<p><a href="FixederSysLight2x.ttf">FixederSys Light 2x</a> - A
  modified version of FixederSys2x with thinner strokes, but the same
  metrics. Still pixel-exact.
  <div class="detail">&hearts;&nbsp;Some of the extended characters are
	currently just copies of FixederSys 2x. I will fix it some day.
  </div>
</p>

<p>Feel free to use and distribute these fonts. I haven't made
"official" releases of them yet, since I am still tweaking and adding
more characters. Unicode support is currently mediocre, but it works
for my ISO Latin-1++ needs. I last remembered to update this sentence
after uploading a new version on 26 Apr 2025.

<p>In emacs on Windows, this works best for me: <tt>(set-frame-font "FixederSys 2x-24:antialias=none")</tt>.</p>

<p>I've also used a hand-tweaked bitmap version of FixedSys in several
  of my games and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tom7/videos">videos</a>.
  You can download that image, called <a href="font.png">font.png</a>,
  if you like.</p>

<p>I also have a number of much less-exacting fonts I made in high school and college: <a href="http://fonts.tom7.com/">Divide By Zero Fonts</a>.</p>
