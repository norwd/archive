<p><b>Why Tom is 'Tom 7'</b>

<p align=justify>As it turns out, my name really is Thomas Walter
Murphy VII. My father was the 6th, his father the 5th, etc. When I was
growing up, we'd get phone calls for "Tom", and due to the ambiguity,
we'd have to ask, "big Tom, or little Tom?". I eventually got sick of
being "little Tom", and "Tom Junior" isn't really accurate, so it
became "Tom 7".

<p align=justify>Now that I'm in Pittsburgh, where the mayor's name
was also Tom Murphy (for like 12 years, at least), "Tom 7" helps keep
me straight from him and all the bajillions of other Tom Murphys
around.

<p>And now you know!
