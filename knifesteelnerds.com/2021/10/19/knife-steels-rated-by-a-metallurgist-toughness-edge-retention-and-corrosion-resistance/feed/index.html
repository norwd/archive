this is good to know. i was wondering as well. i probably will end up sticking 14c28n though. while i see where you&#039;re coming at im personally the type of irresponsible knife user that has found himself having to use his knife as a pry bar to break down various things or to hack into tough materials and the last thing i&#039;d want in those situations is to snap the blade or have it shatter in my face. even as far as edge damage goes i much prefer a rolled edge over a chipped edge. thanks again for the info]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Besides their composition, steel grades are also rated based on toughness, edge retention, and corrosion resistance. The rating on each of these aspects will directly influence the intended use for a knife, as well as its price point &#8211; the higher rating or overall quality of a steel grade in a blade, the higher it will cost you. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about the different steel types and their rating, I&#8217;d recommend reading this article. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I have been thinking about this for a while but couldn&#039;t find much. If you have 2 steels only differing in carbon content, like 1045 and 1095, when they are at the same hardness, will there be a measurable difference in edge retention?
It kind of looks like the only factor for the plain carbon steels is hardness not actual carbon content. I often have seen this discussed, 1045 is tougher but does not keep an edge as well, but what if they are at the same hardness?
Looking at 1084vs1095 there is a toughness difference, but on the CARTA-graph all the carbon steels look to be on a neat line correlating with hardness.

Also is there maybe a list with numbers for the CARTA results? Personally I find the graph a bit too loaded now and also like nice, crisp numbers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I would like to know, if there is a formula or equation to compare steels with different toughness / edge retention. For example if there is a steel with toughness 10, edge retention 5 and one with toughness 1 and edge retention 6, I would assume, that the first steel is far better then the second, because you should be able to sharpen a knife with the first steel to a much more delicate edge and get a better edge retention while still remain a higher toughness.
So is there perhaps a formula like &quot;you loose one toughness per 2° smaller sharpening angle and win x edge retention per 2° smaller sharpening angle&quot;?

Best regards
