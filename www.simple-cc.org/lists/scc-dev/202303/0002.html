Hi,

<a name="0003qlink1"><br />I began with scc because I couldn't find any good compiler for z80. The
</a><br />
code generated by sdcc was based in the 8051 code generator and it was
<br />
horrible. At that time I was also very involved with the suckless
<br />
community, and for a while the project was part of suckless and at that
<br />
moment is when it moved to cover more platforms. As qbe maintainer,
<br />
mpu, was also involved in suckless we decided to join efforts, ans this
<br />
is how scc began to use qbe as backend of the backend.
<br />
<br />At this moment scc is able to compile suckless sbase (using musl instead
<br />
of the scc internal libc) and Hiltjo has used it to test his sfeed project.
<br />
I have to admit, as you already would have seen, that scc is still in
<br />
early stages of development (after many years), but it is beginning
<br />
better and better and it can be used for more projects now. I was
<br />
concentrated to be able to compile the scc libc with scc itself
<br />
because it enables me to begin to pass to the next stage of the
<br />
bootstrapping that is compiling scc with scc.
<br />
<br />The libc (or at least parts of it) was used in Arm trusted firmware
<br />
project [1], and there is a company called Clue that is also using it
<br />
but as closed software (allowed by the license of the project). The
<br />
objective of the libc was to be as simple as possible and make it eassy
<br />
to port to anyy system, including baremetal projects (this is why Arm
<br />
and Clue used it).
<br />
