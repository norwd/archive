hi,

</em><br><br />Yeah, it was a mistake and I think the correct way in that case would
<br />
be to put me like author and you in a footer like 'Reported-by:'. Cases
<br />
like that one would be caught better following a more strict review
<br />
process.
<br />
<br /><a href="0020.html#0021qlink2">&gt; 2) identification and isolation of bugs go unattributed

</em><br><em class="quotelev1">&gt; about errors, let them read the man pages&quot;)
</em><br><br />You cannot force people to accept your changes in the way you wrote
<br />
them.  I tried to simplify the process removing unneeded round
<br />
<a name="0025qlink1"><a name="0024qlink1"><a name="0022qlink1">trips. Sorry if the attribution of the patches were lost in some
<br />
moment, but we usually don't care so much about these kind of things.
<br />
I can understand that they are important for you, but you should
<br />
also try to understand that other people have relaxed point of
<br />
views and can make mistakes about it. This is what I am trying to
</a><br />
solve now.
</a><br />
<a name="0022qlink2"><br />Also, you have to understand that a project maintainer can take
<br />
the decisions about what changes to be merged, and what changes not
<br />
to be merged.
</a></a><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br><a href="0020.html#0021qlink3">&gt; 4) patches get modified without attribution or opportunity to revise,
</a><br>
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leaving my work incompatible, and either I have to back out my own work or
</em><br><em class="quotelev1">&gt; get further out of sync
</em><br><br />As I said I just tried to avoid unneeded round trips. I had to live
<br />
with even 5 iterations upstreaming to some projects and I usually
<br />
prefer to avoid it to make the life of everyone easier. Doing
<br />
multiple iterations would also create the same problems in you if
<br />
you cannot work directly over the diff, and I am not going to accept
<br />
patches with known problems because it breaks the history.
<br />
<br /><br /><a href="0020.html#0021qlink4">&gt; 5) I don't even have git on my main development environment (32-bit Minix
</a><br>
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3.1.6) and will absolutely not port a GPL tool to it (use Fossil ffs)
</em><br><br />You don't have to port git. 9front wrote its own git implementation
<br />
from scratch for example [1] (in fact, OpenBSD is creating its own
<br />
git implementation based in the code from 9front).
<br />
<br />Still, you don't need to use a tool to follow the format, just to
<br />
know how to write patch files that can be automatically applied
<br />
containing all the metadata for ownership, summary and comments.
<br />
Otherwise I have to rephrase and reorganize your commit comments
<br />
before applying them and in that case maybe I should add me like a
<br />
co-author. This is why I ask you to follow that convention that
<br />
avoids that problem because then the commit is created just from
<br />
your diff file.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br><a href="0020.html#0021qlink5">&gt; 7) stunning hypocrisy to suggest I need to follow better commit and patch
</a><br>
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; protocols
</em><br><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 8) stunning hypocrisy to complain about having to hand-modify patches
</em><br><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br><br />Sorry if you felt that I was being hypocratic, I just pointed you to
<br />
common resources used in many projects and followed by the scc project
<br />
itself. Please, just try to understand that we can have some protocols
<br />
and in your case I tried to relax them to make easier for you to upstream
<br />
contributions but then I mistook and then you got angry with me. I apologize
<br />
for my errors but to avoid future problems I just tried to follow strictly
<br />
the process to avoid new mistakes from my side or your side in the future.
<br />
If we follow this process then the patch will not be applied until all of us
<br />
we agree that it is in the correct shape, including attributions and comments
<br />
in the commit.
<br />
<br />Again, sorry because I think the shorcuts that I applied were harmful at the
<br />
end, but I just tried to make easier to upstream your contributions.
<br />
<br />&gt; Basically, I'm upstreaming my patches as a courtesy.
<br>
<a name="0022qlink4"><br />Thank you for that. I am just trying to follow the etiquette that would
<br />
avoid new mistakes in the future.
</a><br />
<br />Regards
