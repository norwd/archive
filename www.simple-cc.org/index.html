              <strong>SCC</strong>
              (<strong>S</strong>imple <strong>C C</strong>ompiler)
              is a portable toolchain that can be
              compiled on any UNIX system out of the box. The main
              target of the project is simplicity and portability.
              <strong>SCC</strong> is mainly written in C, putting
              special interest to keep the code C99 portable and with
              a small size.
              <strong>This is a work in progress project,
              and a lot of work is still required for some use cases.
              Any help would be really appreciated</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>SCC</strong> tries to implements tools
              equivalent to classical <em>UNIX</em>
              cc, cpp, make, as, ld, ar, nm, ranlib, size and strip,
              and <em>GNU</em> objdump and objcopy.
              Not all of them have the same maturity level,
              and some of them are currently just a draft.
              <strong>SCC</strong> also provides a pure C99 libc
              designed to be simple and easily portable.
            </p>

      <p>
        The internal libc is used for bare metal systems
        (an example of this use case can be found in
        <a href="https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/license.html#other-projects">Arm Trusted Firmware</a>)
        or for systems that lack a system libc
        (like for example in the case of z80).
        Retargeting the libc requires implementing less than 10 primivites
        (usually syscalls).
        <strong>SCC</strong> can be used with the system libc,
        providing full POSIX compability
        in Linux using <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a>,
        and the native <a href="https://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>
        and <a href="https://netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> libcs.

      <h2>Get started</h2>
        <p>
          Browse the <a href="https://git.simple-cc.org/scc">source</a>
          and clone it at <a
          href="git://git.simple-cc.org/scc">git://git.simple-cc.org/scc</a>.
          Compiling the project is as simple like:
        </p>
    <pre><code>$ make PREFIX=$HOME config
$ make
$ make install</code></pre>
        <br>
        <p>
          If the <em>PREFIX</em> macro is not specified in the
          config step then it will point to <code>/usr/local</code>
          by default. For more information about how to build SCC,
          you can look at the
          <a href="https://git.simple-cc.org/scc/file/README.html">README</a> file.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Some configurations of <strong>SCC</strong> require having the
	        <a href=https://c9x.me/compile>QBE</a>
	        executable in the PATH,
	        whose version must support common storage
	        which was incorporated after the commit 8ded7a5,
	        but it is not part of a stable release of
	        <a href=https://c9x.me/compile>QBE</a>
	        yet.

      <h2>SCC logo</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>SCC</strong> logo is inspired from
          <em>The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha</em>,
          more precisely in the Quixote's attack on some windmills
          which he believes to be ferocious giants. Quoting the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quixotism">Wikipedia</a>:
        </p>
        <quote>
          Quixotism is impracticality in pursuit of ideals, especially
          those ideals manifested by rash, lofty and romantic ideas or
          extravagantly chivalrous action.
          Quixotism is usually related to "over-idealism", meaning an
          idealism that doesn't take consequence or absurdity into account.
          It is also related to naive romanticism and to utopianism

          These paragraphs reasonably illustrate the spirit of the
          <strong>SCC</strong> project.
