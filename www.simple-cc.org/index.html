              <strong>SCC</strong>
              (<strong>S</strong>imple <strong>C C</strong>ompiler)
              is a portable toolchain that can be
              compiled on any UNIX system out of the box. The main
              target of the project is simplicity and portability.
              <strong>SCC</strong> is mainly written in C, putting
              special interest to keep the code C99 portable and with
              a small size.
              <strong>This is a work in progress project,
              and a lot of work is still required for some use cases.
              Any help would be really appreciated</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>SCC</strong> tries to implements tools
              equivalent to classical <em>UNIX</em>
              cc, cpp, make, as, ld, ar, nm, ranlib, size and strip,
              and <em>GNU</em> objdump and objcopy.
              Not all of them have the same madurity level,
              and some of them are currently just a draft.
              <strong>SCC</strong> also provides a pure C99 libc
              designed to be simple and easily portable.

            <p>
              <strong>SCC</strong> tries to keep full
              powered system through the use of
              <a href="//c9x.me/compile">QBE</a>
              for code generation, the use of
              <a href="//musl.libc.org">musl</a>
              libc in the case of Linux, and the native
              <a href="//openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>
              or <a href="//netbsd.org">NetBSD</a> libcs (maybe other
              libc work too but it is not tested).
              It can also be used with low powered or legacy system
              (like for example z80),
              and that is the reason why
              it incorporates a portable C99 libc.
            </p>

        <p>
          For pure C99 code that does not depend of any feature
          defined by
          <a href="//pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/">POSIX</a>
          you can use the <strong>SCC</strong> libc, that
          only implements the C99 libc specification, including
          the semantic (for example it considers a non threaded
          environment).
          This libc is suitable for baremetal systems
          because it has a minimun and delimited set of system dependencies
          (an example of this use case can be found in
          <a href="https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/license.html#other-projects">Arm Trusted Firmware</a>).
